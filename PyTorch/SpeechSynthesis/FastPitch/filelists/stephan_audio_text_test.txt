wavs/13_63.wav|As a newcomer, I had a very significant respect for them in the first place,|1

wavs/13_453.wav|put the stuff on it.|1
wavs/12_13.wav|But probable as this seems, it is by no means a proven conclusion.|1
wavs/13_460.wav|Then White rode on with his scout and we stayed for a while to talk about religious|1

wavs/13_260.wav|The gentlemen came out with their eyes and their faces distorted behind their bushes.|1
wavs/11_72.wav|and then amid the clanger of the machinery came a drifting suspicion of human voices|1

wavs/13_27.wav|because we would have led the Reds to our tracks.|1
wavs/13_145.wav|As a result, I knew that the engineer in front of us was a very capable man.|1
wavs/1_57.wav|and the poor brute within gave vent to a series of short, sharp cries.|1

wavs/10_102.wav|a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came drifting down the stream|1
wavs/9_182.wav|Perhaps 20 feet, scarcely waistdeep.|1
