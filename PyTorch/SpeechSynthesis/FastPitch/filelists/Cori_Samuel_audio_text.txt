hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0339.mp3|you a member of a starving proletariat never|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0569.mp3|and in the silence mister verloc heard against a window pane the faint buzzing of a fly his first fly of the year heralding better than any number of swallows the approach of spring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0573.mp3|heavy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0639.mp3|mister verloc aware of the sensation raised his head bravely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0777.mp3|and the absurd ferocity of such a demonstration will affect them more profoundly than the mangling of a whole street or theatre full of their own kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0069.mp3|he a pessimist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0224.mp3|simple is it not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0389.mp3|a blue cap with a patent leather peak set well at the back of his yellow bush of hair gave him the aspect of a norwegian sailor bored with the world after a thundering spree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0441.mp3|humiliating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0178.mp3|they've only to get somebody for the job who does not know you carry enough stuff in your pocket to blow yourself and everything within sixty yards of you to pieces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0215.mp3|horrors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0397.mp3|how am i to express myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0404.mp3|the other without flinching lowered and raised his head slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0605.mp3|what are you going to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0639.mp3|you believe there were two men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0060.mp3|her drawing room was probably the only place in the wide world where an assistant commissioner of police could meet a convict liberated on a ticket of leave on other than professional and official ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0071.mp3|unfortunately one of the police constables got shot too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0126.mp3|she was as it were above the play of economic conditions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0302.mp3|it is only when our appointed activities seem by a lucky accident to obey the particular earnestness of our temperament that we can taste the comfort of complete self deception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0304.mp3|the police work he had been engaged on in a distant part of the globe had the saving character of an irregular sort of warfare or at least the risk and excitement of open air sport|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0352.mp3|he allowed himself a little conceited laugh and repeated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0645.mp3|and he repeated as if reconsidering the suggestion conscientiously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0259.mp3|for him the plain duty is to fasten the guilt upon as many prominent anarchists as he can on some slight indications he had picked up in the course of his investigation on the spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0463.mp3|a murky gloomy dampness enveloped him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0110.mp3|no stevie must remain destitute and dependent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0118.mp3|she got her hand bag an umbrella with an impassive face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0390.mp3|but it was hard hard cruelly hard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0435.mp3|there were two omnibuses to take and a short walk between|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0292.mp3|goodness me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0254.mp3|how could he explain leaving it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0329.mp3|look here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0352.mp3|it was a silly murderous trick to expose for nothing a man like me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0614.mp3|it was in her veins in her bones in the roots of her hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0127.mp3|the man who had taken stevie out from under her very eyes to murder him in a locality whose name was at the moment not present to her memory would not allow her go out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0174.mp3|do you think i wanted him to blow himself up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0264.mp3|the dark forms of the man and woman glided slowly arm in arm along the walls with a loverlike and homeless aspect in the miserable night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0333.mp3|love him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0369.mp3|and his father threatened to kick him out of the business if he made such a fool of himself as to marry a girl with a crippled mother and a crazy idiot of a boy on her hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0475.mp3|how did you first come to hear of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0500.mp3|nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0616.mp3|all the money there was in the bank or what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0301.mp3|one point in which he had vastly the advantage over his four footed brethren was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had made no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0389.mp3|his countenance in this repose was mild and kindly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0506.mp3|he seemed away from us although we saw him but a few yards off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0158.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0231.mp3|therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0017.mp3|her mother's only treasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0018.mp3|how strange indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0089.mp3|whispered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0477.mp3|well well indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0307.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0027.mp3|so strangely did they meet in the dim wood that it was like the first encounter in the world beyond the grave of two spirits who had been intimately connected in their former life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0360.mp3|that i am utterly bewildered as touching the purport of your words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0373.mp3|we must needs talk thus in the daytime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0443.mp3|come in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0041.mp3|look your last on the scarlet letter and its wearer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0171.mp3|the crowd meanwhile looked on with awe and wonder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0359.mp3|then down he sank upon the scaffold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0411.mp3|to keep the torture always at red heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0081.mp3|be true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0177.mp3|but through the remainder of hester's life there were indications that the recluse of the scarlet letter was the object of love and interest with some inhabitant of another land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0090.mp3|all the distress of spirit and all the tension of its bow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0773.mp3|which does not wish to be misunderstood and mistaken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0114.mp3|this latter doubt is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among savage as well as among civilized peoples is the most sudden and excessive sensuality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0130.mp3|how is the negation of will possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0200.mp3|these sentences with their truth absolutely inverted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0517.mp3|as the man who has so far flown highest and gone astray in the finest fashion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0553.mp3|asceticism and puritanism are almost indispensable means of educating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0664.mp3|was that a work for your hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_04_nietzsche_0104.mp3|or stupid enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0893.mp3|divined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0252.mp3|indeed he sets himself to reflect on his suffering but in vain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0631.mp3|conspicuous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0655.mp3|have there ever been such philosophers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0019.mp3|and is there anything finer than to search for one's own virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0469.mp3|and how many spirits we harbour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0828.mp3|but she does not want truth what does woman care for truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0843.mp3|finally i ask the question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0271.mp3|because|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0459.mp3|deterioration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0156.mp3|from which it follows that it is the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence for the mask and not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0248.mp3|they were rising imperceptibly we approaching imperceptibly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0087.mp3|unthinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0072.mp3|and his grandson will go on with variations dictated by the fashions of his day treasuring such of his grandfather's heavier and more costly pieces as he imagines will do credit to the family|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0459.mp3|no is it kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0473.mp3|hell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0113.mp3|although considerably alarmed i did not lose my senses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0148.mp3|i am not for a single instant going to blame the authorities who would not listen to the offer of a motherly yellow woman to go to the crimea and nurse her sons there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0348.mp3|these|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0011.mp3|i can put on record the written opinions of those who had ample means of judging and ascertaining how i fulfilled the great object which i had in view in leaving england for the crimea|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0022.mp3|why couldn't things attend to themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0570.mp3|do you suppose your own sister would want you to stay here roasting in the city if she knew you had a nephew just aching to carry you off to the ocean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0106.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0179.mp3|was the world turned upside down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0001.mp3|going out in the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0002.mp3|left his shop nominally in charge of his brother in law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0004.mp3|because there was very little business at any time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0005.mp3|and practically none at all before the evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0006.mp3|mister verloc cared but little about his ostensible business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0007.mp3|and moreover his wife was in charge of his brother in law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0008.mp3|the shop was small and so was the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0009.mp3|it was one of those grimy brick houses which existed in large quantities before the era of reconstruction dawned upon london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0010.mp3|the shop was a square box of a place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0011.mp3|with the front glazed in small panes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0012.mp3|in the daytime the door remained closed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0013.mp3|in the evening it stood discreetly but suspiciously ajar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0014.mp3|the window contained photographs of more or less undressed dancing girls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0015.mp3|nondescript packages in wrappers like patent medicines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0016.mp3|closed yellow paper envelopes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0017.mp3|very flimsy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0018.mp3|and marked two and six in heavy black figures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0019.mp3|a few numbers of ancient french comic publications hung across a string as if to dry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0020.mp3|a dingy blue china bowl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0021.mp3|a casket of black wood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0023.mp3|and rubber stamps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0024.mp3|a few books with titles hinting at impropriety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0025.mp3|a few apparently old copies of obscure newspapers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0026.mp3|badly printed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0027.mp3|with titles like the torch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0028.mp3|the gong rousing titles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0029.mp3|and the two gas jets inside the panes were always turned low|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0030.mp3|either for economy's sake or for the sake of the customers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0031.mp3|these customers were either very young men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0032.mp3|who hung about the window for a time before slipping in suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0033.mp3|or men of a more mature age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0034.mp3|but looking generally as if they were not in funds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0035.mp3|some of that last kind had the collars of their overcoats turned right up to their moustaches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0036.mp3|and traces of mud on the bottom of their nether garments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0037.mp3|which had the appearance of being much worn and not very valuable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0038.mp3|and the legs inside them did not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0039.mp3|as a general rule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0040.mp3|seem of much account either|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0041.mp3|with their hands plunged deep in the side pockets of their coats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0042.mp3|they dodged in sideways|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0043.mp3|one shoulder first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0044.mp3|as if afraid to start the bell going|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0045.mp3|the bell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0046.mp3|hung on the door by means of a curved ribbon of steel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0047.mp3|was difficult to circumvent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0048.mp3|it was hopelessly cracked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0049.mp3|but of an evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0050.mp3|at the slightest provocation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0051.mp3|it clattered behind the customer with impudent virulence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0052.mp3|it clattered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0053.mp3|and at that signal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0054.mp3|through the dusty glass door behind the painted deal counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0055.mp3|mister verloc would issue hastily from the parlour at the back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0056.mp3|his eyes were naturally heavy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0057.mp3|he had an air of having wallowed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0058.mp3|fully dressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0059.mp3|all day on an unmade bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0060.mp3|another man would have felt such an appearance a distinct disadvantage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0061.mp3|in a commercial transaction of the retail order much depends on the seller's engaging and amiable aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0062.mp3|but mister verloc knew his business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0065.mp3|steady eyed impudence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0066.mp3|which seemed to hold back the threat of some abominable menace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0067.mp3|he would proceed to sell over the counter some object looking obviously and scandalously not worth the money which passed in the transaction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0068.mp3|a small cardboard box with apparently nothing inside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0069.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0070.mp3|or one of those carefully closed yellow flimsy envelopes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0071.mp3|or a soiled volume in paper covers with a promising title|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0073.mp3|yellow dancing girls would get sold to an amateur|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0074.mp3|as though she had been alive and young|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0076.mp3|winnie verloc was a young woman with a full bust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0077.mp3|in a tight bodice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0078.mp3|and with broad hips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0079.mp3|her hair was very tidy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0080.mp3|steady eyed like her husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0081.mp3|she preserved an air of unfathomable indifference behind the rampart of the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0082.mp3|then the customer of comparatively tender years would get suddenly disconcerted at having to deal with a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0084.mp3|retail value sixpence price in verloc's shop one and sixpence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0086.mp3|once outside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0087.mp3|he would drop stealthily into the gutter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0089.mp3|and with a muttered greeting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0090.mp3|lifted up the flap at the end of the counter in order to pass into the back parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0091.mp3|which gave access to a passage and to a steep flight of stairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0093.mp3|exercised his vocation of a protector of society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0094.mp3|and cultivated his domestic virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0095.mp3|these last were pronounced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0096.mp3|he was thoroughly domesticated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0097.mp3|neither his spiritual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0098.mp3|nor his mental|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0099.mp3|nor his physical needs were of the kind to take him much abroad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0100.mp3|he found at home the ease of his body and the peace of his conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0102.mp3|winnie's mother was a stout wheezy woman with a large brown face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0103.mp3|she wore a black wig under a white cap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0104.mp3|her swollen legs rendered her inactive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0105.mp3|she considered herself to be of french descent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0106.mp3|which might have been true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0109.mp3|this topographical fact was of some advantage in advertising her rooms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0110.mp3|but the patrons of the worthy widow were not exactly of the fashionable kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0111.mp3|such as they were her daughter winnie helped to look after them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0112.mp3|traces of the french descent which the widow boasted of were apparent in winnie too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0113.mp3|they were apparent in the extremely neat and artistic arrangement of her glossy dark hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0114.mp3|winnie had also other charms her youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0117.mp3|the provocation of her unfathomable reserve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0118.mp3|which never went so far as to prevent conversation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0120.mp3|and on hers with an equable amiability|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0121.mp3|it must be that mister verloc was susceptible to these fascinations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0122.mp3|mister verloc was an intermittent patron|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0123.mp3|he came and went without any very apparent reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0124.mp3|he generally arrived in london like the influenza from the continent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0125.mp3|only he arrived unheralded by the press|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0126.mp3|and his visitations set in with great severity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0127.mp3|he breakfasted in bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0128.mp3|and remained wallowing there with an air of quiet enjoyment till noon every day and sometimes even to a later hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0129.mp3|but when he went out he seemed to experience a great difficulty in finding his way back to his temporary home in the belgravian square|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0130.mp3|he left it late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0131.mp3|and returned to it early as early as three or four in the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0132.mp3|and on waking up at ten addressed winnie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0133.mp3|bringing in the breakfast tray|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0135.mp3|exhausted civility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0137.mp3|failing tones of a man who had been talking vehemently for many hours together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0140.mp3|the bedclothes were pulled up to his chin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0141.mp3|and his dark smooth moustache covered his thick lips capable of much honeyed banter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0142.mp3|in winnie's mother's opinion mister verloc was a very nice gentleman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0143.mp3|from her life's experience gathered in various|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0144.mp3|business houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0145.mp3|the good woman had taken into her retirement an ideal of gentlemanliness as exhibited by the patrons of private saloon bars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0147.mp3|of course we'll take over your furniture mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0148.mp3|winnie had remarked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0149.mp3|the lodging house was to be given up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0150.mp3|it seems it would not answer to carry it on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0151.mp3|it would have been too much trouble for mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0152.mp3|it would not have been convenient for his other business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0153.mp3|what his business was he did not say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0154.mp3|but after his engagement to winnie he took the trouble to get up before noon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0155.mp3|and descending the basement stairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0156.mp3|make himself pleasant to winnie's mother in the breakfast room downstairs where she had her motionless being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0157.mp3|he stroked the cat poked the fire had his lunch served to him there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0158.mp3|he left its slightly stuffy cosiness with evident reluctance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0161.mp3|remained out till the night was far advanced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0162.mp3|he never offered to take winnie to theatres|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0163.mp3|as such a nice gentleman ought to have done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0164.mp3|his evenings were occupied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0165.mp3|his work was in a way political he told winnie once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0168.mp3|to be very nice to his political friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0169.mp3|and with her straight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0172.mp3|how much more he told her as to his occupation it was impossible for winnie's mother to discover|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0173.mp3|the married couple took her over with the furniture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0175.mp3|the change from the belgravian square to the narrow street in soho affected her legs adversely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0176.mp3|they became of an enormous size|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0177.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0178.mp3|she experienced a complete relief from material cares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0179.mp3|her son in law's heavy good nature inspired her with a sense of absolute safety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0180.mp3|her daughter's future was obviously assured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0181.mp3|and even as to her son stevie she need have no anxiety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0182.mp3|she had not been able to conceal from herself that he was a terrible encumbrance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0183.mp3|that poor stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0184.mp3|but in view of winnie's fondness for her delicate brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0185.mp3|and of mister verloc's kind and generous disposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0186.mp3|she felt that the poor boy was pretty safe in this rough world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0187.mp3|and in her heart of hearts she was not perhaps displeased that the verlocs had no children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0188.mp3|as that circumstance seemed perfectly indifferent to mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0189.mp3|and as winnie found an object of quasi maternal affection in her brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0190.mp3|perhaps this was just as well for poor stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0191.mp3|for he was difficult to dispose of that boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0192.mp3|he was delicate and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0194.mp3|good looking too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0195.mp3|except for the vacant droop of his lower lip|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0196.mp3|under our excellent system of compulsory education he had learned to read and write|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0198.mp3|but as errand boy he did not turn out a great success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0199.mp3|he forgot his messages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0200.mp3|he was easily diverted from the straight path of duty by the attractions of stray cats and dogs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0201.mp3|which he followed down narrow alleys into unsavoury courts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0202.mp3|by the comedies of the streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0203.mp3|which he contemplated open mouthed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0204.mp3|to the detriment of his employer's interests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0205.mp3|or by the dramas of fallen horses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0207.mp3|which disliked to be disturbed by sounds of distress in its quiet enjoyment of the national spectacle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0208.mp3|when led away by a grave and protecting policeman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0209.mp3|it would often become apparent that poor stevie had forgotten his address at least for a time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0210.mp3|a brusque question caused him to stutter to the point of suffocation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0211.mp3|when startled by anything perplexing he used to squint horribly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0212.mp3|however he never had any fits which was encouraging|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0213.mp3|and before the natural outbursts of impatience on the part of his father he could always|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0215.mp3|run for protection behind the short skirts of his sister winnie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0216.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0217.mp3|he might have been suspected of hiding a fund of reckless naughtiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0218.mp3|when he had reached the age of fourteen a friend of his late father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0219.mp3|an agent for a foreign preserved milk firm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0220.mp3|having given him an opening as office boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0221.mp3|he was discovered one foggy afternoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0222.mp3|in his chief's absence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0223.mp3|busy letting off fireworks on the staircase|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0224.mp3|he touched off in quick succession a set of fierce rockets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0225.mp3|angry catherine wheels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0226.mp3|loudly exploding squibs and the matter might have turned out very serious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0227.mp3|an awful panic spread through the whole building|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0232.mp3|his motives for this stroke of originality were difficult to discover|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0235.mp3|but his father's friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0237.mp3|dismissed him summarily as likely to ruin his business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0238.mp3|after that altruistic exploit stevie was put to help wash the dishes in the basement kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0240.mp3|there was obviously no future in such work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0243.mp3|but altogether all that did not amount to much either in the way of gain or prospects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0245.mp3|with a sigh and a glance towards the scullery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0246.mp3|what would become of poor stephen now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0248.mp3|which was the whole visible fortune of the family|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0251.mp3|the furniture was disposed to the best advantage all over the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0253.mp3|the luckless stevie slept in one of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0254.mp3|by this time a growth of thin fluffy hair had come to blur|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0255.mp3|like a golden mist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0256.mp3|the sharp line of his small lower jaw|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0258.mp3|mister verloc thought that some occupation would be good for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0259.mp3|his spare time he occupied by drawing circles with compass and pencil on a piece of paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0260.mp3|he applied himself to that pastime with great industry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0261.mp3|with his elbows spread out and bowed low over the kitchen table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0262.mp3|through the open door of the parlour at the back of the shop winnie|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_01_conrad_0264.mp3|glanced at him from time to time with maternal vigilance|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0002.mp3|and the business mister verloc left behind him on his way westward at the hour of half past ten in the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0003.mp3|it was unusually early for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0005.mp3|he wore his blue cloth overcoat unbuttoned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0006.mp3|his boots were shiny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0009.mp3|refreshed by a night of peaceful slumber|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0010.mp3|sent out glances of comparative alertness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0011.mp3|through the park railings these glances beheld men and women riding in the row|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0012.mp3|couples cantering past harmoniously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0014.mp3|loitering groups of three or four|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0015.mp3|solitary horsemen looking unsociable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0016.mp3|and solitary women followed at a long distance by a groom with a cockade to his hat and a leather belt over his tight fitting coat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0017.mp3|carriages went bowling by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0019.mp3|with here and there a victoria with the skin of some wild beast inside and a woman's face and hat emerging above the folded hood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0021.mp3|it hung at a moderate elevation above hyde park corner with an air of punctual and benign vigilance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0023.mp3|in which neither wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0026.mp3|nor man cast a shadow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0027.mp3|mister verloc was going westward through a town without shadows in an atmosphere of powdered old gold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0029.mp3|coppery gleams on the roofs of houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0030.mp3|on the corners of walls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0031.mp3|on the panels of carriages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0032.mp3|on the very coats of the horses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0033.mp3|and on the broad back of mister verloc's overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0034.mp3|where they produced a dull effect of rustiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0035.mp3|but mister verloc was not in the least conscious of having got rusty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0036.mp3|he surveyed through the park railings the evidences of the town's opulence and luxury with an approving eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0037.mp3|all these people had to be protected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0038.mp3|protection is the first necessity of opulence and luxury|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0039.mp3|they had to be protected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0040.mp3|and their horses carriages houses servants had to be protected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0041.mp3|and the source of their wealth had to be protected in the heart of the city and the heart of the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0042.mp3|the whole social order favourable to their hygienic idleness had to be protected against the shallow enviousness of unhygienic labour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0043.mp3|it had to and mister verloc would have rubbed his hands with satisfaction had he not been constitutionally averse from every superfluous exertion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0044.mp3|his idleness was not hygienic but it suited him very well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0045.mp3|he was in a manner devoted to it with a sort of inert fanaticism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0046.mp3|or perhaps rather with a fanatical inertness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0047.mp3|born of industrious parents for a life of toil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0048.mp3|he had embraced indolence from an impulse as profound as inexplicable and as imperious as the impulse which directs a man's preference for one particular woman in a given thousand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0049.mp3|he was too lazy even for a mere demagogue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0050.mp3|for a workman orator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0051.mp3|for a leader of labour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0052.mp3|it was too much trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0053.mp3|he required a more perfect form of ease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0055.mp3|such a form of indolence requires|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0057.mp3|a certain amount of intelligence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0058.mp3|mister verloc was not devoid of intelligence and at the notion of a menaced social order he would perhaps have winked to himself if there had not been an effort to make in that sign of scepticism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0059.mp3|his big prominent eyes were not well adapted to winking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0060.mp3|they were rather of the sort that closes solemnly in slumber with majestic effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0061.mp3|undemonstrative and burly in a fat pig style|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0062.mp3|mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0063.mp3|without either rubbing his hands with satisfaction or winking sceptically at his thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0064.mp3|proceeded on his way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0065.mp3|he trod the pavement heavily with his shiny boots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0066.mp3|and his general get up was that of a well to do mechanic in business for himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0068.mp3|an employer of labour in a small way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0069.mp3|but there was also about him an indescribable air which no mechanic could have acquired in the practice of his handicraft however dishonestly exercised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0070.mp3|the air common to men who live on the vices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0071.mp3|the follies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0074.mp3|to private detectives and inquiry agents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0078.mp3|but of that last i am not sure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0079.mp3|not having carried my investigations so far into the depths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0080.mp3|for all i know the expression of these last may be perfectly diabolic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0081.mp3|i shouldn't be surprised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0083.mp3|before reaching knightsbridge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0084.mp3|mister verloc took a turn to the left out of the busy main thoroughfare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0085.mp3|uproarious with the traffic of swaying omnibuses and trotting vans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0086.mp3|in the almost silent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0087.mp3|swift flow of hansoms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0088.mp3|under his hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0089.mp3|worn with a slight backward tilt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0090.mp3|his hair had been carefully brushed into respectful sleekness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0091.mp3|for his business was with an embassy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0092.mp3|and mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0093.mp3|steady like a rock a soft kind of rock marched now along a street which could with every propriety be described as private|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0097.mp3|of matter that never dies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0099.mp3|the polished knockers of the doors gleamed as far as the eye could reach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0101.mp3|and all was still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0102.mp3|but a milk cart rattled noisily across the distant perspective|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0103.mp3|a butcher boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0104.mp3|driving with the noble recklessness of a charioteer at olympic games|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0105.mp3|dashed round the corner sitting high above a pair of red wheels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0106.mp3|a guilty looking cat issuing from under the stones ran for a while in front of mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0107.mp3|then dived into another basement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0108.mp3|and a thick police constable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0109.mp3|looking a stranger to every emotion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0110.mp3|as if he too were part of inorganic nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0112.mp3|took not the slightest notice of mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0114.mp3|for some inscrutable reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0116.mp3|chesham square was at least sixty yards away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0117.mp3|and mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0118.mp3|cosmopolitan enough not to be deceived by london's topographical mysteries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0119.mp3|held on steadily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0120.mp3|without a sign of surprise or indignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0122.mp3|with business like persistency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0123.mp3|he reached the square|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0124.mp3|and made diagonally for the number ten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0126.mp3|clean wall between two houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0129.mp3|a street well known in the neighbourhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0130.mp3|was proclaimed by an inscription placed above the ground floor windows by whatever highly efficient authority is charged with the duty of keeping track of london's strayed houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0131.mp3|why powers are not asked of parliament a short act would do for compelling those edifices to return where they belong is one of the mysteries of municipal administration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0132.mp3|mister verloc did not trouble his head about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0133.mp3|his mission in life being the protection of the social mechanism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0134.mp3|not its perfectionment or even its criticism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0135.mp3|it was so early that the porter of the embassy issued hurriedly out of his lodge still struggling with the left sleeve of his livery coat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0136.mp3|his waistcoat was red|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0137.mp3|and he wore knee breeches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0138.mp3|but his aspect was flustered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0140.mp3|aware of the rush on his flank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0141.mp3|drove it off by simply holding out an envelope stamped with the arms of the embassy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0142.mp3|and passed on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0143.mp3|he produced the same talisman also to the footman who opened the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0144.mp3|and stood back to let him enter the hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0145.mp3|a clear fire burned in a tall fireplace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0146.mp3|and an elderly man standing with his back to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0147.mp3|in evening dress and with a chain round his neck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0148.mp3|glanced up from the newspaper he was holding spread out in both hands before his calm and severe face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0149.mp3|he didn't move|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0150.mp3|but another lackey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0152.mp3|approaching mister verloc listened to the murmur of his name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0153.mp3|and turning round on his heel in silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0154.mp3|began to walk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0155.mp3|without looking back once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0156.mp3|mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0157.mp3|thus led along a ground floor passage to the left of the great carpeted staircase|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0158.mp3|was suddenly motioned to enter a quite small room furnished with a heavy writing table and a few chairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0159.mp3|the servant shut the door and mister verloc remained alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0160.mp3|he did not take a seat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0161.mp3|with his hat and stick held in one hand he glanced about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0162.mp3|passing his other podgy hand over his uncovered sleek head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0163.mp3|another door opened noiselessly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0164.mp3|and mister verloc immobilising his glance in that direction saw at first only black clothes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0165.mp3|the bald top of a head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0167.mp3|the person who had entered was holding a batch of papers before his eyes and walked up to the table with a rather mincing step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0168.mp3|turning the papers over the while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0171.mp3|was rather short sighted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0172.mp3|this meritorious official laying the papers on the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0173.mp3|disclosed a face of pasty complexion and of melancholy ugliness surrounded by a lot of fine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0174.mp3|long dark grey hairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0175.mp3|barred heavily by thick and bushy eyebrows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0177.mp3|and seemed struck by mister verloc's appearance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0178.mp3|under the enormous eyebrows his weak eyes blinked pathetically through the glasses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0179.mp3|he made no sign of greeting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0180.mp3|neither did mister verloc who certainly knew his place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0181.mp3|but a subtle change about the general outlines of his shoulders and back suggested a slight bending of mister verloc's spine under the vast surface of his overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0182.mp3|the effect was of unobtrusive deference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0184.mp3|said the bureaucrat in an unexpectedly soft and weary voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0185.mp3|and pressing the tip of his forefinger on the papers with force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0186.mp3|he paused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0189.mp3|waited in an almost breathless silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0190.mp3|we are not very satisfied with the attitude of the police here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0191.mp3|the other continued with every appearance of mental fatigue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0192.mp3|the shoulders of mister verloc without actually moving suggested a shrug|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0193.mp3|and for the first time since he left his home that morning his lips opened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0194.mp3|every country has its police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0195.mp3|he said philosophically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0196.mp3|but as the official of the embassy went on blinking at him steadily he felt constrained to add|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0197.mp3|allow me to observe that i have no means of action upon the police here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0198.mp3|what is desired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0199.mp3|said the man of papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0200.mp3|is the occurrence of something definite which should stimulate their vigilance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0201.mp3|that is within your province is it not so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0202.mp3|mister verloc made no answer except by a sigh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0203.mp3|which escaped him involuntarily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0204.mp3|for instantly he tried to give his face a cheerful expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0205.mp3|the official blinked doubtfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0206.mp3|as if affected by the dim light of the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0207.mp3|he repeated vaguely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0208.mp3|the vigilance of the police and the severity of the magistrates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0209.mp3|the general leniency of the judicial procedure here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0210.mp3|and the utter absence of all repressive measures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0212.mp3|what is wished for just now is the accentuation of the unrest of the fermentation which undoubtedly exists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0213.mp3|undoubtedly undoubtedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0215.mp3|so utterly different from the tone in which he had spoken before that his interlocutor remained profoundly surprised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0216.mp3|it exists to a dangerous degree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0217.mp3|my reports for the last twelve months make it sufficiently clear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0218.mp3|your reports for the last twelve months|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0220.mp3|have been read by me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0221.mp3|i failed to discover why you wrote them at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0222.mp3|a sad silence reigned for a time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0224.mp3|and the other gazed at the papers on the table fixedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0225.mp3|at last he gave them a slight push|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0226.mp3|the state of affairs you expose there is assumed to exist as the first condition of your employment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0228.mp3|but the bringing to light of a distinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0229.mp3|significant fact i would almost say of an alarming fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0230.mp3|i need not say that all my endeavours shall be directed to that end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0231.mp3|mister verloc said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0232.mp3|with convinced modulations in his conversational husky tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0234.mp3|he stopped short with a gesture of absolute devotion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0235.mp3|the useful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0236.mp3|hard working|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0237.mp3|if obscure member of the embassy had an air of being impressed by some newly born thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0238.mp3|you are very corpulent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0239.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0240.mp3|this observation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0241.mp3|really of a psychological nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0243.mp3|stung mister verloc in the manner of a rude personal remark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0244.mp3|he stepped back a pace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0246.mp3|what were you pleased to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0247.mp3|he exclaimed with husky resentment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0249.mp3|i think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0250.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0253.mp3|be good enough to wait here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0254.mp3|he added and went out with mincing steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0255.mp3|at once mister verloc passed his hand over his hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0256.mp3|a slight perspiration had broken out on his forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0257.mp3|he let the air escape from his pursed up lips like a man blowing at a spoonful of hot soup|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0258.mp3|but when the servant in brown appeared at the door silently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0259.mp3|mister verloc had not moved an inch from the place he had occupied throughout the interview|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0260.mp3|he had remained motionless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0261.mp3|as if feeling himself surrounded by pitfalls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0262.mp3|he walked along a passage lighted by a lonely gas jet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0264.mp3|and through a glazed and cheerful corridor on the first floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0265.mp3|the footman threw open a door and stood aside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0266.mp3|the feet of mister verloc felt a thick carpet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0267.mp3|the room was large with three windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0268.mp3|and a young man with a shaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0269.mp3|big face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0270.mp3|sitting in a roomy arm chair before a vast mahogany writing table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0272.mp3|who was going out with the papers in his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0274.mp3|he's fat the animal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0276.mp3|first secretary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0277.mp3|had a drawing room reputation as an agreeable and entertaining man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0278.mp3|he was something of a favourite in society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0279.mp3|his wit consisted in discovering droll connections between incongruous ideas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0280.mp3|and when talking in that strain he sat well forward of his seat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0281.mp3|with his left hand raised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0283.mp3|while his round and clean shaven face wore an expression of merry perplexity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0284.mp3|but there was no trace of merriment or perplexity in the way he looked at mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0286.mp3|with squarely spread elbows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0287.mp3|and throwing one leg over a thick knee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0288.mp3|he had with his smooth and rosy countenance the air of a preternaturally thriving baby that will not stand nonsense from anybody|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0289.mp3|you understand french i suppose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0290.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0291.mp3|mister verloc stated huskily that he did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0292.mp3|his whole vast bulk had a forward inclination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0293.mp3|he stood on the carpet in the middle of the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0294.mp3|clutching his hat and stick in one hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0295.mp3|the other hung lifelessly by his side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0296.mp3|he muttered unobtrusively somewhere deep down in his throat something about having done his military service in the french artillery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0297.mp3|at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0298.mp3|with contemptuous perversity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0300.mp3|and began to speak idiomatic english without the slightest trace of a foreign accent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0303.mp3|of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0307.mp3|mister verloc answered unexpectedly but without any sign of feeling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0308.mp3|you got off easily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0310.mp3|and anyhow it served you right for letting yourself get caught|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0311.mp3|what made you go in for that sort of thing eh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0312.mp3|mister verloc's husky conversational voice was heard speaking of youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0313.mp3|of a fatal infatuation for an unworthy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0317.mp3|there was on the contrary a touch of grimness in his condescension|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0319.mp3|he asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0321.mp3|mister verloc answered in subdued tones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0322.mp3|and protruding his lips sadly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0323.mp3|in sign of sorrow for the deceased diplomat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0324.mp3|the first secretary observed this play of physiognomy steadily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0328.mp3|what have you got to say for yourself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0329.mp3|he asked sharply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0330.mp3|mister verloc answered with some surprise that he was not aware of having anything special to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0331.mp3|he had been summoned by a letter and he plunged his hand busily into the side pocket of his overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0334.mp3|concluded to leave it there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0336.mp3|said that latter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0337.mp3|what do you mean by getting out of condition like this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0340.mp3|you a desperate socialist or anarchist which is it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0342.mp3|stated mister verloc in a deadened tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0346.mp3|you wouldn't deceive an idiot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0348.mp3|so you began your connection with us by stealing the french gun designs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0349.mp3|and you got yourself caught|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0350.mp3|that must have been very disagreeable to our government|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0351.mp3|you don't seem to be very smart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0352.mp3|mister verloc tried to exculpate himself huskily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0353.mp3|as i've had occasion to observe before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0354.mp3|a fatal infatuation for an unworthy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0357.mp3|the unlucky attachment of your youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0360.mp3|the momentary drooping of his whole person|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0361.mp3|confessed that such was the regrettable case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0363.mp3|the sock was of dark blue silk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0364.mp3|you see that was not very clever of you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0365.mp3|perhaps you are too susceptible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0366.mp3|mister verloc intimated in a throaty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0369.mp3|that's a failing which age does not cure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0373.mp3|you could not have come to look like this if you had been at all susceptible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0374.mp3|i'll tell you what i think is the matter you are a lazy fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0375.mp3|how long have you been drawing pay from this embassy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0376.mp3|eleven years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0377.mp3|was the answer after a moment of sulky hesitation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0379.mp3|then by his excellency's instructions i settled down in london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0380.mp3|i am english|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0384.mp3|a natural born british subject|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0385.mp3|mister verloc said stolidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0386.mp3|but my father was french and so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0387.mp3|never mind explaining|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0388.mp3|interrupted the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0394.mp3|but as i've said you are a lazy fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0395.mp3|you don't use your opportunities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0397.mp3|they caused fellows of your sort to form a false conception of the nature of a secret service fund|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0398.mp3|it is my business to correct this misapprehension by telling you what the secret service is not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0399.mp3|it is not a philanthropic institution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0400.mp3|i've had you called here on purpose to tell you this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0402.mp3|and smiled sarcastically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0403.mp3|i see that you understand me perfectly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0404.mp3|i daresay you are intelligent enough for your work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0405.mp3|what we want now is activity activity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0408.mp3|the nape of his gross neck became crimson above the velvet collar of his overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0409.mp3|his lips quivered before they came widely open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0410.mp3|if you'll only be good enough to look up my record|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0411.mp3|he boomed out in his great clear oratorical bass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0412.mp3|you'll see i gave a warning only three months ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0414.mp3|which was telegraphed from here to the french police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0418.mp3|the french police had no use for your warning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0419.mp3|don't roar like this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0420.mp3|what the devil do you mean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0422.mp3|his voice famous for years at open air meetings and at workmen's assemblies in large halls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0424.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0425.mp3|to his reputation of a good and trustworthy comrade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0426.mp3|it was therefore a part of his usefulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0427.mp3|it had inspired confidence in his principles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0428.mp3|i was always put up to speak by the leaders at a critical moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0429.mp3|mister verloc declared with obvious satisfaction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0430.mp3|there was no uproar above which he could not make himself heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0431.mp3|he added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0432.mp3|and suddenly he made a demonstration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0433.mp3|allow me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0434.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0435.mp3|with lowered forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0436.mp3|without looking up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0437.mp3|swiftly and ponderously he crossed the room to one of the french windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0438.mp3|as if giving way to an uncontrollable impulse he opened it a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0440.mp3|jumping up amazed from the depths of the arm chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0441.mp3|looked over his shoulder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0443.mp3|across the courtyard of the embassy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0444.mp3|well beyond the open gate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0445.mp3|could be seen the broad back of a policeman watching idly the gorgeous perambulator of a wealthy baby being wheeled in state across the square|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0449.mp3|mister verloc shut the window quietly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0450.mp3|and returned to the middle of the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0451.mp3|with a voice like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0452.mp3|he said putting on the husky conversational pedal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0453.mp3|i was naturally trusted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0454.mp3|and i knew what to say too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0456.mp3|arranging his cravat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0457.mp3|observed him in the glass over the mantelpiece|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0459.mp3|he said contemptuously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0461.mp3|you haven't ever studied latin have you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0463.mp3|growled mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0464.mp3|you did not expect me to know it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0466.mp3|who knows latin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0467.mp3|only a few hundred imbeciles who aren't fit to take care of themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0469.mp3|the gross bulk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0470.mp3|of the man behind him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0471.mp3|and at the same time he had the advantage of seeing his own face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0472.mp3|clean shaved and round|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0473.mp3|rosy about the gills|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0478.mp3|casting an oblique glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0479.mp3|quailed inwardly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0481.mp3|you dare be impudent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0487.mp3|well i am going to speak plain english to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0489.mp3|we have no use for your voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0490.mp3|we don't want a voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0491.mp3|we want facts startling facts damn you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0492.mp3|he added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0493.mp3|with a sort of ferocious discretion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0495.mp3|don't you try to come over me with your hyperborean manners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0496.mp3|mister verloc defended himself huskily looking at the carpet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0497.mp3|at this his interlocutor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0498.mp3|smiling mockingly above the bristling bow of his necktie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0499.mp3|switched the conversation into french|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0502.mp3|as far as i can judge from your record kept here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0503.mp3|you have done nothing to earn your money for the last three years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0505.mp3|exclaimed verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0506.mp3|stirring not a limb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0507.mp3|and not raising his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0508.mp3|but with the note of sincere feeling in his tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0509.mp3|i have several times prevented what might have been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0510.mp3|there is a proverb in this country which says prevention is better than cure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0512.mp3|it is stupid in a general way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0513.mp3|there is no end to prevention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0514.mp3|but it is characteristic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0515.mp3|they dislike finality in this country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0516.mp3|don't you be too english|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0518.mp3|the evil is already here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0519.mp3|we don't want prevention we want cure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0521.mp3|turned to the desk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0522.mp3|and turning over some papers lying there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0523.mp3|spoke in a changed business like tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0524.mp3|without looking at mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0527.mp3|of the international conference assembled in milan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0528.mp3|mister verloc intimated hoarsely that he was in the habit of reading the daily papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0531.mp3|he understood what he read|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0533.mp3|smiling faintly at the documents he was still scanning one after another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0534.mp3|murmured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0535.mp3|as long as it is not written in latin i suppose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0536.mp3|or chinese|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0537.mp3|added mister verloc stolidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0541.mp3|what are all these leaflets headed f p|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0542.mp3|with a hammer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0544.mp3|and torch crossed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0545.mp3|what does it mean this f p|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0546.mp3|mister verloc approached the imposing writing table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0548.mp3|it's a society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0549.mp3|he explained standing ponderously by the side of the arm chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0550.mp3|not anarchist in principle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0551.mp3|but open to all shades of revolutionary opinion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0553.mp3|one of the vice presidents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0554.mp3|mister verloc breathed out heavily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0555.mp3|and the first secretary of the embassy raised his head to look at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0556.mp3|then you ought to be ashamed of yourself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0557.mp3|he said incisively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0559.mp3|why don't you do something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0560.mp3|look here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0561.mp3|i've this matter in hand now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0562.mp3|and i tell you plainly that you will have to earn your money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0564.mp3|no work no pay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0565.mp3|mister verloc felt a queer sensation of faintness in his stout legs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0566.mp3|he stepped back one pace and blew his nose loudly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0567.mp3|he was in truth startled and alarmed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0568.mp3|the rusty london sunshine struggling clear of the london mist shed a lukewarm brightness into the first secretary's private room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0570.mp3|the useless fussing of that tiny energetic organism affected unpleasantly this big man threatened in his indolence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0572.mp3|the fellow was unexpectedly vulgar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0574.mp3|and impudently unintelligent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0575.mp3|he looked uncommonly like a master plumber come to present his bill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0576.mp3|the first secretary of the embassy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0578.mp3|had formed a special notion of that class of mechanic as the embodiment of fraudulent laziness and incompetency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0581.mp3|semi official|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0582.mp3|and confidential correspondence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0583.mp3|the celebrated agent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0584.mp3|whose warnings had the power to change the schemes and the dates of royal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0587.mp3|and sometimes caused them to be put off altogether|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0588.mp3|this fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0590.mp3|partly at his own astonishment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0591.mp3|which he judged naive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0593.mp3|his late excellency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0594.mp3|whom the august favour of his imperial master had imposed as ambassador upon several reluctant ministers of foreign affairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0595.mp3|had enjoyed in his lifetime a fame for an owlish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0596.mp3|pessimistic gullibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0597.mp3|his excellency had the social revolution on the brain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0598.mp3|he imagined himself to be a diplomatist set apart by a special dispensation to watch the end of diplomacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0599.mp3|and pretty nearly the end of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0600.mp3|in a horrid democratic upheaval|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0601.mp3|his prophetic and doleful despatches had been for years the joke of foreign offices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0602.mp3|he was said to have exclaimed on his deathbed visited by his imperial friend and master|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0603.mp3|unhappy europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0604.mp3|thou shalt perish by the moral insanity of thy children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0605.mp3|he was fated to be the victim of the first humbugging rascal that came along|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0607.mp3|smiling vaguely at mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0609.mp3|he exclaimed suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0610.mp3|the lowered physiognomy of mister verloc expressed a sombre and weary annoyance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0611.mp3|permit me to observe to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0612.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0613.mp3|that i came here because i was summoned by a peremptory letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0614.mp3|i have been here only twice before in the last eleven years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0615.mp3|and certainly never at eleven in the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0616.mp3|it isn't very wise to call me up like this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0617.mp3|there is just a chance of being seen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0618.mp3|and that would be no joke for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0620.mp3|it would destroy my usefulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0621.mp3|continued the other hotly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0622.mp3|that's your affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0624.mp3|when you cease to be useful you shall cease to be employed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0625.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0626.mp3|right off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0627.mp3|cut short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0632.mp3|at a loss for a sufficiently idiomatic expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0633.mp3|and instantly brightened up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0634.mp3|with a grin of beautifully white teeth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0635.mp3|you shall be chucked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0636.mp3|he brought out ferociously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0637.mp3|once more mister verloc had to react with all the force of his will against that sensation of faintness running down one's legs which once upon a time had inspired some poor devil with the felicitous expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0638.mp3|my heart went down into my boots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0641.mp3|what we want is to administer a tonic to the conference in milan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0642.mp3|he said airily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0643.mp3|its deliberations upon international action for the suppression of political crime don't seem to get anywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0644.mp3|england lags|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0645.mp3|this country is absurd with its sentimental regard for individual liberty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0647.mp3|in that way i have them all under my eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0648.mp3|mister verloc interrupted huskily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0649.mp3|it would be much more to the point to have them all under lock and key|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0650.mp3|england must be brought into line|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0652.mp3|and they have the political power still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0653.mp3|if they only had the sense to use it for their preservation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0654.mp3|i suppose you agree that the middle classes are stupid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0655.mp3|mister verloc agreed hoarsely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0657.mp3|they have no imagination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0658.mp3|they are blinded by an idiotic vanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0659.mp3|what they want just now is a jolly good scare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0660.mp3|this is the psychological moment to set your friends to work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0661.mp3|i have had you called here to develop to you my idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0663.mp3|with scorn and condescension|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0664.mp3|displaying at the same time an amount of ignorance as to the real aims|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0667.mp3|he confounded causes with effects more than was excusable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0668.mp3|the most distinguished propagandists with impulsive bomb throwers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0670.mp3|spoke of the social revolutionary party one moment as of a perfectly disciplined army|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0671.mp3|where the word of chiefs was supreme|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0672.mp3|and at another as if it had been the loosest association of desperate brigands that ever camped in a mountain gorge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0673.mp3|once mister verloc had opened his mouth for a protest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0674.mp3|but the raising of a shapely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0675.mp3|large white hand arrested him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0676.mp3|very soon he became too appalled to even try to protest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0677.mp3|he listened in a stillness of dread which resembled the immobility of profound attention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0678.mp3|a series of outrages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0680.mp3|executed here in this country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0681.mp3|not only planned here that would not do they would not mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0684.mp3|mister verloc cleared his throat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0685.mp3|but his heart failed him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0686.mp3|and he said nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0687.mp3|these outrages need not be especially sanguinary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0689.mp3|but they must be sufficiently startling effective|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0690.mp3|let them be directed against buildings for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0693.mp3|mister verloc opened his hands and shrugged his shoulders slightly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0694.mp3|you are too lazy to think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0696.mp3|pay attention to what i say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0697.mp3|the fetish of to day is neither royalty nor religion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0698.mp3|therefore the palace and the church should be left alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0699.mp3|you understand what i mean mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0701.mp3|perfectly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0702.mp3|but what of the embassies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0703.mp3|a series of attacks on the various embassies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0704.mp3|he began|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0706.mp3|watchful stare of the first secretary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0707.mp3|you can be facetious i see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0708.mp3|the latter observed carelessly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0709.mp3|that's all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0710.mp3|it may enliven your oratory at socialistic congresses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0711.mp3|but this room is no place for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0714.mp3|you had better try to make your profit off what i am taking the trouble to explain to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0717.mp3|is it not part of these institutions which must be swept away before the f p comes along|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0718.mp3|mister verloc said nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0720.mp3|this is what you should try for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0722.mp3|but not so much as it used to be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0724.mp3|it's almost conventional especially since so many presidents have been assassinated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0725.mp3|now let us take an outrage upon say a church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0726.mp3|horrible enough at first sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0728.mp3|and yet not so effective as a person of an ordinary mind might think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0729.mp3|no matter how revolutionary and anarchist in inception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0730.mp3|there would be fools enough to give such an outrage the character of a religious manifestation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0731.mp3|and that would detract from the especial alarming significance we wish to give to the act|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0733.mp3|the exasperation of a hungry man an act of social revenge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0734.mp3|all this is used up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0735.mp3|it is no longer instructive as an object lesson in revolutionary anarchism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0737.mp3|i am about to give you the philosophy of bomb throwing from my point of view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0738.mp3|from the point of view you pretend to have been serving for the last eleven years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0739.mp3|i will try not to talk above your head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0740.mp3|the sensibilities of the class you are attacking are soon blunted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0741.mp3|property seems to them an indestructible thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0742.mp3|you can't count upon their emotions either of pity or fear for very long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0743.mp3|a bomb outrage to have any influence on public opinion now must go beyond the intention of vengeance or terrorism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0744.mp3|it must be purely destructive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0745.mp3|it must be that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0746.mp3|and only that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0747.mp3|beyond the faintest suspicion of any other object|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0748.mp3|you anarchists should make it clear that you are perfectly determined to make a clean sweep of the whole social creation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0749.mp3|but how to get that appallingly absurd notion into the heads of the middle classes so that there should be no mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0750.mp3|that's the question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0751.mp3|by directing your blows at something outside the ordinary passions of humanity is the answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0752.mp3|of course there is art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0753.mp3|a bomb in the national gallery would make some noise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0754.mp3|but it would not be serious enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0756.mp3|it's like breaking a few back windows in a man's house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0757.mp3|whereas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0758.mp3|if you want to make him really sit up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0759.mp3|you must try at least to raise the roof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0760.mp3|there would be some screaming of course but from whom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0761.mp3|artists art critics and such like people of no account|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0762.mp3|nobody minds what they say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0763.mp3|but there is learning science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0764.mp3|any imbecile that has got an income believes in that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0765.mp3|he does not know why but he believes it matters somehow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0769.mp3|to make room for the future of the proletariat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0770.mp3|a howl from all these intellectual idiots is bound to help forward the labours of the milan conference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0771.mp3|they will be writing to the papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0772.mp3|their indignation would be above suspicion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0773.mp3|no material interests being openly at stake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0774.mp3|and it will alarm every selfishness of the class which should be impressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0775.mp3|they believe that in some mysterious way science is at the source of their material prosperity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0782.mp3|almost unthinkable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0783.mp3|in fact mad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0784.mp3|madness alone is truly terrifying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0785.mp3|inasmuch as you cannot placate it either by threats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0790.mp3|even if i expected the best results from it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0791.mp3|but i wouldn't expect from a butchery the result i want|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0792.mp3|murder is always with us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0793.mp3|it is almost an institution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0794.mp3|the demonstration must be against learning science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0795.mp3|but not every science will do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0796.mp3|the attack must have all the shocking senselessness of gratuitous blasphemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0798.mp3|it would be really telling if one could throw a bomb into pure mathematics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0799.mp3|but that is impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0801.mp3|i have expounded to you the higher philosophy of your usefulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0802.mp3|and suggested to you some serviceable arguments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0803.mp3|the practical application of my teaching interests you mostly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0804.mp3|but from the moment i have undertaken to interview you i have also given some attention to the practical aspect of the question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0805.mp3|what do you think of having a go at astronomy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0807.mp3|such as may be observed in the domestic dog having a nightmare on the hearthrug|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0809.mp3|astronomy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0811.mp3|it had overcome his power of assimilation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0812.mp3|it had made him angry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0813.mp3|this anger was complicated by incredulity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0814.mp3|and suddenly it dawned upon him that all this was an elaborate joke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0816.mp3|with dimples on his round|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0818.mp3|the favourite of intelligent society women had assumed his drawing room attitude accompanying the delivery of delicate witticisms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0819.mp3|sitting well forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0820.mp3|his white hand upraised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0821.mp3|he seemed to hold delicately between his thumb and forefinger the subtlety of his suggestion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0822.mp3|there could be nothing better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0823.mp3|such an outrage combines the greatest possible regard for humanity with the most alarming display of ferocious imbecility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0824.mp3|i defy the ingenuity of journalists to persuade their public that any given member of the proletariat can have a personal grievance against astronomy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0825.mp3|starvation itself could hardly be dragged in there eh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0826.mp3|and there are other advantages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0828.mp3|the very boot blacks in the basement of charing cross station know something of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0831.mp3|so well known in the best society by their humorous urbanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0832.mp3|beamed with cynical self satisfaction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0834.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0835.mp3|he continued with a contemptuous smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0836.mp3|the blowing up of the first meridian is bound to raise a howl of execration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0837.mp3|a difficult business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0838.mp3|mister verloc mumbled feeling that this was the only safe thing to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0839.mp3|what is the matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0840.mp3|haven't you the whole gang under your hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0841.mp3|the very pick of the basket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0844.mp3|and michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0846.mp3|because if you don't i can tell you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0849.mp3|you are mistaken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0852.mp3|haven't they been flocking over here at the first hint of the milan conference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0853.mp3|this is an absurd country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0854.mp3|it will cost money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0855.mp3|mister verloc said by a sort of instinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0856.mp3|that cock won't fight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0858.mp3|you'll get your screw every month and no more till something happens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0859.mp3|and if nothing happens very soon you won't get even that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0860.mp3|what's your ostensible occupation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0861.mp3|what are you supposed to live by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0862.mp3|i keep a shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0863.mp3|answered mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0864.mp3|a shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0865.mp3|what sort of shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0866.mp3|stationery newspapers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0867.mp3|my wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0871.mp3|mister verloc raised his husky voice slightly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0872.mp3|i am married|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0873.mp3|that be damned for a yarn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0874.mp3|exclaimed the other in unfeigned astonishment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0875.mp3|married|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0878.mp3|but i suppose it's merely a manner of speaking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0879.mp3|anarchists don't marry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0880.mp3|it's well known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0881.mp3|they can't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0883.mp3|my wife isn't one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0885.mp3|moreover it's no concern of yours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0886.mp3|oh yes it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0890.mp3|you must have discredited yourself completely in your own world by your marriage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0891.mp3|couldn't you have managed without|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0892.mp3|this is your virtuous attachment eh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0893.mp3|what with one sort of attachment and another you are doing away with your usefulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0895.mp3|puffing out his cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0896.mp3|let the air escape violently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0897.mp3|and that was all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0898.mp3|he had armed himself with patience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0899.mp3|it was not to be tried much longer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0900.mp3|the first secretary became suddenly very curt detached final|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0901.mp3|you may go now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0902.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0903.mp3|a dynamite outrage must be provoked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0904.mp3|i give you a month|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0905.mp3|the sittings of the conference are suspended|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0906.mp3|before it reassembles again something must have happened here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0907.mp3|or your connection with us ceases|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0908.mp3|he changed the note once more with an unprincipled versatility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0910.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0913.mp3|go for the first meridian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0914.mp3|you don't know the middle classes as well as i do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0915.mp3|their sensibilities are jaded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0916.mp3|the first meridian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0917.mp3|nothing better and nothing easier i should think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0918.mp3|he had got up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0919.mp3|and with his thin sensitive lips twitching humorously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0920.mp3|watched in the glass over the mantelpiece mister verloc backing out of the room heavily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0921.mp3|hat and stick in hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0922.mp3|the door closed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0923.mp3|the footman in trousers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0924.mp3|appearing suddenly in the corridor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0926.mp3|the porter standing at the gate ignored his exit completely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0927.mp3|and mister verloc retraced the path of his morning's pilgrimage as if in a dream an angry dream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0928.mp3|this detachment from the material world was so complete that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0929.mp3|though the mortal envelope of mister verloc had not hastened unduly along the streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0930.mp3|that part of him to which it would be unwarrantably rude to refuse immortality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0931.mp3|found itself at the shop door all at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0932.mp3|as if borne from west to east on the wings of a great wind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0933.mp3|he walked straight behind the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0934.mp3|and sat down on a wooden chair that stood there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0935.mp3|no one appeared to disturb his solitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0938.mp3|was now sweeping and dusting upstairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0939.mp3|intent and conscientious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0940.mp3|as though he were playing at it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0942.mp3|warned in the kitchen by the clatter of the cracked bell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0944.mp3|and putting the curtain aside a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0946.mp3|seeing her husband sitting there shadowy and bulky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0947.mp3|with his hat tilted far back on his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0950.mp3|and instructed him to wash his hands and face in the peremptory tone she had used in that connection for fifteen years or so ever since she had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0951.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0952.mp3|ceased to attend to the boy's hands and face herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0953.mp3|she spared presently a glance away from her dishing up for the inspection of that face and those hands which stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0954.mp3|approaching the kitchen table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0955.mp3|offered for her approval with an air of self assurance hiding a perpetual residue of anxiety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0956.mp3|formerly the anger of the father was the supremely effective sanction of these rites|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0959.mp3|winnie after the death of her father found considerable consolation in the feeling that she need no longer tremble for poor stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0964.mp3|she finished her dishing up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0965.mp3|the table was laid in the parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0966.mp3|going to the foot of the stairs she screamed out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0968.mp3|then opening the glazed door leading to the shop she said quietly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0970.mp3|mister verloc had not changed his position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0971.mp3|he had not apparently stirred a limb for an hour and a half|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0972.mp3|he got up heavily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0974.mp3|without uttering a word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0975.mp3|his silence in itself had nothing startlingly unusual in this household|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0976.mp3|hidden in the shades of the sordid street seldom touched by the sun|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0977.mp3|behind the dim shop with its wares of disreputable rubbish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0979.mp3|they sat silent themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0980.mp3|keeping a watchful eye on poor stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0982.mp3|he faced mister verloc across the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0983.mp3|and remained very good and quiet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0984.mp3|staring vacantly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0986.mp3|that boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0987.mp3|as they alluded to him softly between themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0988.mp3|had been a source of that sort of anxiety almost from the very day of his birth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0990.mp3|for he was a person of fine sensibilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0991.mp3|and his sufferings as a man and a father were perfectly genuine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0993.mp3|who are themselves a queer lot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0994.mp3|and are easily aggrieved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0995.mp3|and there was always the anxiety of his mere existence to face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0996.mp3|visions of a workhouse infirmary for her child had haunted the old woman in the basement breakfast room of the decayed belgravian house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0997.mp3|if you had not found such a good husband my dear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0998.mp3|she used to say to her daughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0999.mp3|i don't know what would have become of that poor boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1000.mp3|mister verloc extended as much recognition to stevie as a man not particularly fond of animals may give to his wife's beloved cat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1001.mp3|and this recognition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1002.mp3|benevolent and perfunctory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1003.mp3|was essentially of the same quality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1004.mp3|both women admitted to themselves that not much more could be reasonably expected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1005.mp3|it was enough to earn for mister verloc the old woman's reverential gratitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1006.mp3|in the early days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1008.mp3|she used sometimes to ask anxiously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1013.mp3|once however she retorted with a rather grim pertness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1014.mp3|he'll have to get tired of me first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1015.mp3|a long silence ensued|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1016.mp3|the mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1017.mp3|with her feet propped up on a stool|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1018.mp3|seemed to be trying to get to the bottom of that answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1019.mp3|whose feminine profundity had struck her all of a heap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1021.mp3|it was very sensible of her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1022.mp3|and evidently had turned out for the best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1023.mp3|but her girl might have naturally hoped to find somebody of a more suitable age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1024.mp3|there had been a steady young fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1025.mp3|only son of a butcher in the next street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1026.mp3|helping his father in business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1027.mp3|with whom winnie had been walking out with obvious gusto|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1028.mp3|he was dependent on his father it is true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1029.mp3|but the business was good and his prospects excellent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1030.mp3|he took her girl to the theatre on several evenings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1032.mp3|with stevie on her hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1033.mp3|that romance came to an abrupt end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1035.mp3|but mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1036.mp3|turning up providentially to occupy the first floor front bedroom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1037.mp3|there had been no more question of the young butcher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_1038.mp3|it was clearly providential|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0001.mp3|to beautify it is to take away its character of complexity it is to destroy it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0002.mp3|leave that to the moralists my boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0003.mp3|history is made by men but they do not make it in their heads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0004.mp3|the ideas that are born in their consciousness play an insignificant part in the march of events|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0005.mp3|history is dominated and determined by the tool and the production by the force of economic conditions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0006.mp3|capitalism has made socialism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0007.mp3|and the laws made by the capitalism for the protection of property are responsible for anarchism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0010.mp3|at best they can only interpret the mind of the prophet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0011.mp3|and can have no objective value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0012.mp3|leave that pastime to the moralists my boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0014.mp3|the ticket of leave apostle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0015.mp3|was speaking in an even voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0017.mp3|he had come out of a highly hygienic prison round like a tub|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0018.mp3|with an enormous stomach and distended cheeks of a pale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0019.mp3|semi transparent complexion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0020.mp3|as though for fifteen years the servants of an outraged society had made a point of stuffing him with fattening foods in a damp and lightless cellar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0021.mp3|and ever since he had never managed to get his weight down as much as an ounce|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0023.mp3|his martyrdom was continued by forbidding him all access to the healing waters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0024.mp3|but he was resigned now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0025.mp3|with his elbow presenting no appearance of a joint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0026.mp3|but more like a bend in a dummy's limb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0027.mp3|thrown over the back of a chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0028.mp3|he leaned forward slightly over his short and enormous thighs to spit into the grate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0029.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0030.mp3|i had the time to think things out a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0031.mp3|he added without emphasis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0032.mp3|society has given me plenty of time for meditation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0033.mp3|on the other side of the fireplace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0036.mp3|with a faint black grimace of a toothless mouth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0038.mp3|as he called himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0042.mp3|an extraordinary expression of underhand malevolence survived in his extinguished eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0044.mp3|he leaned on a thick stick which trembled under his other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0045.mp3|i have always dreamed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0046.mp3|he mouthed fiercely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0048.mp3|strong enough to give themselves frankly the name of destroyers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0049.mp3|and free from the taint of that resigned pessimism which rots the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0050.mp3|no pity for anything on earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0051.mp3|including themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0052.mp3|and death enlisted for good and all in the service of humanity that's what i would have liked to see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0053.mp3|his little bald head quivered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0055.mp3|his enunciation would have been almost totally unintelligible to a stranger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0056.mp3|his worn out passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0057.mp3|resembling in its impotent fierceness the excitement of a senile sensualist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0058.mp3|was badly served by a dried throat and toothless gums which seemed to catch the tip of his tongue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0059.mp3|mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0060.mp3|established in the corner of the sofa at the other end of the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0062.mp3|the old terrorist turned slowly his head on his skinny neck from side to side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0063.mp3|and i could never get as many as three such men together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0064.mp3|so much for your rotten pessimism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0065.mp3|he snarled at michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0066.mp3|who uncrossed his thick legs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0067.mp3|similar to bolsters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0068.mp3|and slid his feet abruptly under his chair in sign of exasperation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0070.mp3|preposterous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0071.mp3|he cried out that the charge was outrageous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0072.mp3|he was so far from pessimism that he saw already the end of all private property coming along logically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0074.mp3|by the mere development of its inherent viciousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0075.mp3|the possessors of property had not only to face the awakened proletariat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0077.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0078.mp3|struggle warfare was the condition of private ownership|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0079.mp3|it was fatal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0081.mp3|he did not depend upon emotional excitement to keep up his belief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0082.mp3|no declamations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0085.mp3|or metaphorical lurid suns of vengeance rising above the horizon of a doomed society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0087.mp3|cold reason he boasted was the basis of his optimism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0088.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0089.mp3|optimism his laborious wheezing stopped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0090.mp3|then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0091.mp3|after a gasp or two|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0092.mp3|he added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0093.mp3|don't you think that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0094.mp3|if i had not been the optimist i am|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0095.mp3|i could not have found in fifteen years some means to cut my throat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0097.mp3|in the last instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0098.mp3|there were always the walls of my cell to dash my head against|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0099.mp3|the shortness of breath took all fire all animation out of his voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0100.mp3|his great|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0101.mp3|pale cheeks hung like filled pouches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0103.mp3|without a quiver|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0104.mp3|but in his blue eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0105.mp3|narrowed as if peering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0106.mp3|there was the same look of confident shrewdness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0107.mp3|a little crazy in its fixity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0108.mp3|they must have had while the indomitable optimist sat thinking at night in his cell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0112.mp3|seated in front of the fireplace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0113.mp3|comrade ossipon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0114.mp3|ex medical student|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0115.mp3|the principal writer of the f p leaflets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0116.mp3|stretched out his robust legs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0117.mp3|keeping the soles of his boots turned up to the glow in the grate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0120.mp3|with a flattened nose and prominent mouth cast in the rough mould of the negro type|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0124.mp3|and his head resting on the back of his chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0125.mp3|his throat largely exposed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0126.mp3|he raised to his lips a cigarette in a long wooden tube|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0127.mp3|puffing jets of smoke straight up at the ceiling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0128.mp3|michaelis pursued his idea the idea of his solitary reclusion the thought vouchsafed to his captivity and growing like a faith revealed in visions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0129.mp3|he talked to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0130.mp3|indifferent to the sympathy or hostility of his hearers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0131.mp3|indifferent indeed to their presence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0133.mp3|in the sepulchral silence of the great blind pile of bricks near a river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0134.mp3|sinister and ugly like a colossal mortuary for the socially drowned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0135.mp3|he was no good in discussion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0136.mp3|not because any amount of argument could shake his faith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0137.mp3|but because the mere fact of hearing another voice disconcerted him painfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0138.mp3|confusing his thoughts at once these thoughts that for so many years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0139.mp3|in a mental solitude more barren than a waterless desert|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0143.mp3|no one interrupted him now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0144.mp3|and he made again the confession of his faith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0145.mp3|mastering him irresistible and complete like an act of grace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0146.mp3|the secret of fate discovered in the material side of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0147.mp3|the economic condition of the world responsible for the past and shaping the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0148.mp3|the source of all history|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0149.mp3|of all ideas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0151.mp3|he closed them slowly for a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0152.mp3|as if to collect his routed thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0153.mp3|a silence fell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0154.mp3|but what with the two gas jets over the table and the glowing grate the little parlour behind mister verloc's shop had become frightfully hot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0156.mp3|getting off the sofa with ponderous reluctance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0157.mp3|opened the door leading into the kitchen to get more air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0158.mp3|and thus disclosed the innocent stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0163.mp3|innumerable circles concentric eccentric|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0165.mp3|uniformity of form|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0169.mp3|and in all his soul's application to the task his back quivered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0170.mp3|his thin neck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0171.mp3|sunk into a deep hollow at the base of the skull|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0172.mp3|seemed ready to snap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0173.mp3|mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0174.mp3|after a grunt of disapproving surprise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0175.mp3|returned to the sofa|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0178.mp3|shook off the stiffness of long immobility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0179.mp3|and strolled away into the kitchen down two steps to look over stevie's shoulder|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0186.mp3|with a shade of condescension and a toss of his head towards the kitchen|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0205.mp3|but his cheeks became tinged by a faint blush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0207.mp3|in his body as he lived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0208.mp3|with an almost supernatural clearness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0209.mp3|and this phenomenon|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0212.mp3|but he said nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0217.mp3|and the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0218.mp3|his extinguished eyes without gleams blackening the deep shadows under the great|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0221.mp3|catching the tip of his tongue between his lips at every second word as though he were chewing it angrily|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0223.mp3|for him the criminal is the prisoner|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0238.mp3|the knob of his stick and his legs shook together with passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0239.mp3|whilst the trunk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0241.mp3|preserved his historic attitude of defiance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0242.mp3|he seemed to sniff the tainted air of social cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0243.mp3|to strain his ear for its atrocious sounds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0244.mp3|there was an extraordinary force of suggestion in this posturing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0245.mp3|the all but moribund veteran of dynamite wars had been a great actor in his time actor on platforms|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0247.mp3|in private interviews|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0249.mp3|he was no man of action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0250.mp3|he was not even an orator of torrential eloquence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0251.mp3|sweeping the masses along in the rushing noise and foam of a great enthusiasm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0252.mp3|with a more subtle intention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0254.mp3|in the suffering and misery of poverty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0255.mp3|in all the hopeful and noble illusions of righteous anger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0258.mp3|the shadow of his evil gift clung to him yet like the smell of a deadly drug in an old vial of poison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0259.mp3|emptied now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0261.mp3|ready to be thrown away upon the rubbish heap of things that had served their time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0263.mp3|the ticket of leave apostle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0264.mp3|smiled vaguely with his glued lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0266.mp3|he had been a prisoner himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0267.mp3|his own skin had sizzled under the red hot brand he murmured softly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0269.mp3|nicknamed the doctor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0270.mp3|had got over the shock by that time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0271.mp3|you don't understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0272.mp3|he began disdainfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0273.mp3|but stopped short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0274.mp3|intimidated by the dead blackness of the cavernous eyes in the face turned slowly towards him with a blind stare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0275.mp3|as if guided only by the sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0276.mp3|he gave the discussion up with a slight shrug of the shoulders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0278.mp3|accustomed to move about disregarded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0279.mp3|had got up from the kitchen table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0280.mp3|carrying off his drawing to bed with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0282.mp3|the sheet of paper covered with circles dropped out of his fingers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0283.mp3|and he remained staring at the old terrorist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0284.mp3|as if rooted suddenly to the spot by his morbid horror and dread of physical pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0285.mp3|stevie knew very well that hot iron applied to one's skin hurt very much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0286.mp3|his scared eyes blazed with indignation it would hurt terribly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0287.mp3|his mouth dropped open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0289.mp3|his optimism had begun to flow from his lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0290.mp3|he saw capitalism doomed in its cradle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0291.mp3|born with the poison of the principle of competition in its system|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0292.mp3|the great capitalists devouring the little capitalists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0293.mp3|concentrating the power and the tools of production in great masses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0294.mp3|perfecting industrial processes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0297.mp3|enriching|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0301.mp3|and his clear blue glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0303.mp3|had a character of seraphic trustfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0306.mp3|then it's no use doing anything no use whatever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0307.mp3|i don't say that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0308.mp3|protested michaelis gently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0310.mp3|he continued to look down at the red coals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0311.mp3|preparation for the future was necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0312.mp3|and he was willing to admit that the great change would perhaps come in the upheaval of a revolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0313.mp3|but he argued that revolutionary propaganda was a delicate work of high conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0314.mp3|it was the education of the masters of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0315.mp3|it should be as careful as the education given to kings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0316.mp3|he would have it advance its tenets cautiously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0317.mp3|even timidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0318.mp3|in our ignorance of the effect that may be produced by any given economic change upon the happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0319.mp3|the morals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0320.mp3|the intellect|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0322.mp3|for history is made with tools not with ideas|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0327.mp3|the coals in the grate settled down with a slight crash|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0328.mp3|and michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0329.mp3|the hermit of visions in the desert of a penitentiary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0330.mp3|got up impetuously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0331.mp3|round like a distended balloon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0332.mp3|he opened his short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0334.mp3|as if in a pathetically hopeless attempt to embrace and hug to his breast a self regenerated universe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0335.mp3|he gasped with ardour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0336.mp3|the future is as certain as the past slavery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0338.mp3|individualism|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0340.mp3|this is the statement of a law not an empty prophecy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0343.mp3|he said calmly enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0344.mp3|there is no law and no certainty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0345.mp3|the teaching propaganda be hanged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0346.mp3|what the people knows does not matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0347.mp3|were its knowledge ever so accurate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0348.mp3|the only thing that matters to us is the emotional state of the masses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0349.mp3|without emotion there is no action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0350.mp3|he paused then added with modest firmness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0352.mp3|what did you say verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0354.mp3|growled from the sofa mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0356.mp3|provoked by the abhorrent sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0358.mp3|damn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0359.mp3|the venomous spluttering of the old terrorist without teeth was heard|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0361.mp3|i would call it cannibalistic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0362.mp3|that's what it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0364.mp3|stevie swallowed the terrifying statement with an audible gulp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0365.mp3|and at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0366.mp3|as though it had been swift poison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0367.mp3|sank limply in a sitting posture on the steps of the kitchen door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0368.mp3|michaelis gave no sign of having heard anything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0369.mp3|his lips seemed glued together for good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0370.mp3|not a quiver passed over his heavy cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0371.mp3|with troubled eyes he looked for his round|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0373.mp3|and put it on his round head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0375.mp3|the old terrorist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0378.mp3|he got in motion slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0379.mp3|striking the floor with his stick at every step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0380.mp3|it was rather an affair to get him out of the house because|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0382.mp3|he would stop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0383.mp3|as if to think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0384.mp3|and did not offer to move again till impelled forward by michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0385.mp3|the gentle apostle grasped his arm with brotherly care|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0386.mp3|and behind them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0387.mp3|his hands in his pockets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0391.mp3|attending them bareheaded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0392.mp3|his heavy overcoat hanging open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0393.mp3|his eyes on the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0394.mp3|he closed the door behind their backs with restrained violence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0396.mp3|shot the bolt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0397.mp3|he was not satisfied with his friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0399.mp3|the part of mister verloc in revolutionary politics having been to observe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0400.mp3|he could not all at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0401.mp3|either in his own home or in larger assemblies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0402.mp3|take the initiative of action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0403.mp3|he had to be cautious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0404.mp3|moved by the just indignation of a man well over forty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0405.mp3|menaced in what is dearest to him his repose and his security he asked himself scornfully what else could have been expected from such a lot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0408.mp3|pausing in his intention to turn off the gas burning in the middle of the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0409.mp3|mister verloc descended into the abyss of moral reflections|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0410.mp3|with the insight of a kindred temperament he pronounced his verdict|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0412.mp3|nursed by a blear eyed old woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0413.mp3|a woman he had years ago enticed away from a friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0417.mp3|where that spectre took its constitutional crawl every fine morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0419.mp3|and mister verloc's morality was offended also by the optimism of michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0420.mp3|annexed by his wealthy old lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0422.mp3|the ex prisoner could moon about the shady lanes for days together in a delicious and humanitarian idleness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0423.mp3|as to ossipon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0424.mp3|that beggar was sure to want for nothing as long as there were silly girls with savings bank books in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0425.mp3|and mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0426.mp3|temperamentally identical with his associates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0427.mp3|drew fine distinctions in his mind on the strength of insignificant differences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0428.mp3|he drew them with a certain complacency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0429.mp3|because the instinct of conventional respectability was strong within him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0431.mp3|for obviously one does not revolt against the advantages and opportunities of that state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0432.mp3|but against the price which must be paid for the same in the coin of accepted morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0435.mp3|the majority of revolutionists are the enemies of discipline and fatigue mostly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0436.mp3|there are natures too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0437.mp3|to whose sense of justice the price exacted looms up monstrously enormous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0439.mp3|oppressive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0442.mp3|extortionate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0443.mp3|intolerable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0444.mp3|those are the fanatics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0445.mp3|the remaining portion of social rebels is accounted for by vanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0446.mp3|the mother of all noble and vile illusions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0447.mp3|the companion of poets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0448.mp3|reformers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0452.mp3|lost for a whole minute in the abyss of meditation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0453.mp3|mister verloc did not reach the depth of these abstract considerations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0454.mp3|perhaps he was not able|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0455.mp3|in any case he had not the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0457.mp3|another of his associates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0458.mp3|whom in virtue of subtle moral affinities he was capable of judging correctly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0459.mp3|he considered him as dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0460.mp3|a shade of envy crept into his thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0463.mp3|and had women to fall back upon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0464.mp3|whereas he had a woman to provide for at this point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0465.mp3|by a simple association of ideas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0466.mp3|mister verloc was brought face to face with the necessity of going to bed some time or other that evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0467.mp3|then why not go now at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0468.mp3|he sighed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0470.mp3|he dreaded the demon of sleeplessness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0471.mp3|which he felt had marked him for its own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0472.mp3|he raised his arm and turned off the flaring gas jet above his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0473.mp3|a bright band of light fell through the parlour door into the part of the shop behind the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0474.mp3|it enabled mister verloc to ascertain at a glance the number of silver coins in the till|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0475.mp3|these were but few|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0476.mp3|and for the first time since he opened his shop he took a commercial survey of its value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0477.mp3|this survey was unfavourable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0478.mp3|he had gone into trade for no commercial reasons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0479.mp3|he had been guided in the selection of this peculiar line of business by an instinctive leaning towards shady transactions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0480.mp3|where money is picked up easily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0482.mp3|it did not take him out of his own sphere the sphere which is watched by the police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0483.mp3|on the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0484.mp3|it gave him a publicly confessed standing in that sphere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0485.mp3|and as mister verloc had unconfessed relations which made him familiar with yet careless of the police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0486.mp3|there was a distinct advantage in such a situation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0487.mp3|but as a means of livelihood it was by itself insufficient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0488.mp3|he took the cash box out of the drawer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0489.mp3|and turning to leave the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0490.mp3|became aware that stevie was still downstairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0491.mp3|what on earth is he doing there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0493.mp3|what's the meaning of these antics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0494.mp3|he looked dubiously at his brother in law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0495.mp3|but he did not ask him for information|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0497.mp3|after breakfast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0499.mp3|and even that was more a communication at large of a need than a direct order or request|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0500.mp3|mister verloc perceived with some surprise that he did not know really what to say to stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0501.mp3|he stood still in the middle of the parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0502.mp3|and looked into the kitchen in silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0503.mp3|nor yet did he know what would happen if he did say anything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0504.mp3|and this appeared very queer to mister verloc in view of the fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0505.mp3|borne upon him suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0506.mp3|that he had to provide for this fellow too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0507.mp3|he had never given a moment's thought till then to that aspect of stevie's existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0508.mp3|positively he did not know how to speak to the lad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0509.mp3|he watched him gesticulating and murmuring in the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0510.mp3|stevie prowled round the table like an excited animal in a cage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0511.mp3|a tentative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0512.mp3|hadn't you better go to bed now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0513.mp3|produced no effect whatever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0514.mp3|and mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0515.mp3|abandoning the stony contemplation of his brother in law's behaviour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0516.mp3|crossed the parlour wearily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0517.mp3|cash box in hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0518.mp3|the cause of the general lassitude he felt while climbing the stairs being purely mental|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0519.mp3|he became alarmed by its inexplicable character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0520.mp3|he hoped he was not sickening for anything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0521.mp3|he stopped on the dark landing to examine his sensations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0522.mp3|but a slight and continuous sound of snoring pervading the obscurity interfered with their clearness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0523.mp3|the sound came from his mother in law's room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0524.mp3|another one to provide for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0525.mp3|he thought and on this thought walked into the bedroom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0528.mp3|she woke up with the sound of her name in her ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0529.mp3|and saw her husband standing over her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0532.mp3|at first she did not stir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0534.mp3|but when she understood that her brother was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0535.mp3|capering all over the place downstairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0536.mp3|she swung out in one sudden movement on to the edge of the bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0537.mp3|her bare feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0538.mp3|as if poked through the bottom of an unadorned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0540.mp3|felt over the rug for the slippers while she looked upward into her husband's face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0541.mp3|i don't know how to manage him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0542.mp3|mister verloc explained peevishly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0544.mp3|she said nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0545.mp3|glided across the room swiftly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0546.mp3|and the door closed upon her white form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0547.mp3|mister verloc deposited the cash box on the night table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0548.mp3|and began the operation of undressing by flinging his overcoat on to a distant chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0549.mp3|his coat and waistcoat followed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0550.mp3|he walked about the room in his stockinged feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0551.mp3|and his burly figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0552.mp3|with the hands worrying nervously at his throat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0553.mp3|passed and repassed across the long strip of looking glass in the door of his wife's wardrobe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0554.mp3|then after slipping his braces off his shoulders he pulled up violently the venetian blind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0555.mp3|and leaned his forehead against the cold window pane a fragile film of glass stretched between him and the enormity of cold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0559.mp3|inhospitable accumulation of bricks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0562.mp3|things in themselves unlovely and unfriendly to man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0563.mp3|mister verloc felt the latent unfriendliness of all out of doors with a force approaching to positive bodily anguish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0564.mp3|there is no occupation that fails a man more completely than that of a secret agent of police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0565.mp3|it's like your horse suddenly falling dead under you in the midst of an uninhabited and thirsty plain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0567.mp3|and had now the sensation of an incipient fall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0568.mp3|the prospect was as black as the window pane against which he was leaning his forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0570.mp3|clean shaved and witty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0572.mp3|impressed on the fatal darkness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0573.mp3|this luminous and mutilated vision was so ghastly physically that mister verloc started away from the window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0574.mp3|letting down the venetian blind with a great rattle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0575.mp3|discomposed and speechless with the apprehension of more such visions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0576.mp3|he beheld his wife re enter the room and get into bed in a calm business like manner which made him feel hopelessly lonely in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0578.mp3|i don't feel very well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0579.mp3|he muttered passing his hands over his moist brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0584.mp3|with all the placidity of an experienced wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0585.mp3|expressed a confident opinion as to the cause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0586.mp3|and suggested the usual remedies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0587.mp3|but her husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0588.mp3|rooted in the middle of the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0589.mp3|shook his lowered head sadly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0590.mp3|you'll catch cold standing there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0591.mp3|she observed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0592.mp3|mister verloc made an effort finished undressing and got into bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0593.mp3|down below in the quiet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0594.mp3|narrow street measured footsteps approached the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0595.mp3|then died away unhurried and firm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0596.mp3|as if the passer by had started to pace out all eternity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0597.mp3|from gas lamp to gas lamp in a night without end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0598.mp3|and the drowsy ticking of the old clock on the landing became distinctly audible in the bedroom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0600.mp3|takings very small to day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0602.mp3|in the same position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0603.mp3|cleared his throat as if for an important statement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0604.mp3|but merely inquired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0605.mp3|did you turn off the gas downstairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0606.mp3|yes i did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0608.mp3|that poor boy is in a very excited state to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0609.mp3|she murmured after a pause which lasted for three ticks of the clock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0610.mp3|mister verloc cared nothing for stevie's excitement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0611.mp3|but he felt horribly wakeful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0612.mp3|and dreaded facing the darkness and silence that would follow the extinguishing of the lamp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0613.mp3|this dread led him to make the remark that stevie had disregarded his suggestion to go to bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0615.mp3|falling into the trap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0620.mp3|there was no young man of his age in london more willing and docile than stephen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0621.mp3|she affirmed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0622.mp3|none more affectionate and ready to please|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0623.mp3|and even useful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0624.mp3|as long as people did not upset his poor head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0626.mp3|turning towards her recumbent husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0627.mp3|raised herself on her elbow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0628.mp3|and hung over him in her anxiety that he should believe stevie to be a useful member of the family|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0629.mp3|that ardour of protecting compassion exalted morbidly in her childhood by the misery of another child tinged her sallow cheeks with a faint dusky blush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0630.mp3|made her big eyes gleam under the dark lids|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0632.mp3|she looked as young as winnie used to look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0633.mp3|and much more animated than the winnie of the belgravian mansion days had ever allowed herself to appear to gentlemen lodgers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0634.mp3|mister verloc's anxieties had prevented him from attaching any sense to what his wife was saying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0635.mp3|it was as if her voice were talking on the other side of a very thick wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0636.mp3|it was her aspect that recalled him to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0637.mp3|he appreciated this woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0638.mp3|and the sentiment of this appreciation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0639.mp3|stirred by a display of something resembling emotion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0641.mp3|when her voice ceased he moved uneasily and said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0642.mp3|i haven't been feeling well for the last few days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0643.mp3|he might have meant this as an opening to a complete confidence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0645.mp3|and staring upward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0646.mp3|went on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0647.mp3|that boy hears too much of what is talked about here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0648.mp3|if i had known they were coming to night i would have seen to it that he went to bed at the same time i did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0649.mp3|he was out of his mind with something he overheard about eating people's flesh and drinking blood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0650.mp3|what's the good of talking like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0651.mp3|there was a note of indignant scorn in her voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0652.mp3|mister verloc was fully responsive now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0654.mp3|he growled savagely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0656.mp3|a disgusting old man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0657.mp3|she declared openly her affection for michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0659.mp3|in whose presence she always felt uneasy behind an attitude of stony reserve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0660.mp3|she said nothing whatever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0661.mp3|and continuing to talk of that brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0662.mp3|who had been for so many years an object of care and fears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0663.mp3|he isn't fit to hear what's said here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0664.mp3|he believes it's all true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0665.mp3|he knows no better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0666.mp3|he gets into his passions over it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0667.mp3|mister verloc made no comment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0668.mp3|he glared at me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0669.mp3|as if he didn't know who i was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0670.mp3|when i went downstairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0671.mp3|his heart was going like a hammer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0672.mp3|he can't help being excitable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0673.mp3|i woke mother up and asked her to sit with him till he went to sleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0674.mp3|it isn't his fault|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0675.mp3|he's no trouble when he's left alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0676.mp3|mister verloc made no comment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0677.mp3|i wish he had never been to school|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0679.mp3|he's always taking away those newspapers from the window to read|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0681.mp3|we don't get rid of a dozen numbers in a month|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0682.mp3|they only take up room in the front window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0685.mp3|it's silly reading that's what it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0686.mp3|there's no sale for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0687.mp3|the other day stevie got hold of one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0689.mp3|and nothing was done to him for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0691.mp3|i couldn't do anything with stevie that afternoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0692.mp3|the story was enough too to make one's blood boil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0693.mp3|but what's the use of printing things like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0694.mp3|we aren't german slaves here thank god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0695.mp3|it's not our business is it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0696.mp3|mister verloc made no reply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0697.mp3|i had to take the carving knife from the boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0699.mp3|he was shouting and stamping and sobbing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0700.mp3|he can't stand the notion of any cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0701.mp3|he would have stuck that officer like a pig if he had seen him then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0702.mp3|it's true too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0703.mp3|some people don't deserve much mercy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0705.mp3|and the expression of her motionless eyes became more and more contemplative and veiled during the long pause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0706.mp3|comfortable dear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0707.mp3|she asked in a faint far away voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0708.mp3|shall i put out the light now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0710.mp3|he made a great effort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0712.mp3|put it out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_03_conrad_0713.mp3|he said at last in a hollow tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0001.mp3|bronze chandeliers with many globes depended from the low|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0002.mp3|slightly vaulted ceiling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0003.mp3|and the fresco paintings ran flat and dull all round the walls without windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0006.mp3|unless i am very much mistaken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0010.mp3|his elbows far out on the table and his feet tucked back completely under his chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0011.mp3|his eyes stared with wild eagerness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0012.mp3|an upright semi grand piano near the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0013.mp3|flanked by two palms in pots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0015.mp3|the din it raised was deafening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0016.mp3|when it ceased|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0017.mp3|as abruptly as it had started|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0020.mp3|in principle what one of us may or may not know as to any given fact can't be a matter for inquiry to the others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0021.mp3|certainly not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0023.mp3|in principle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0024.mp3|with his big florid face held between his hands he continued to stare hard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0025.mp3|while the dingy little man in spectacles coolly took a drink of beer and stood the glass mug back on the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0029.mp3|the dome of the forehead seemed to rest on the rim of the spectacles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0030.mp3|the flat cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0032.mp3|unhealthy complexion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0033.mp3|were merely smudged by the miserable poverty of a thin dark whisker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0034.mp3|the lamentable inferiority of the whole physique was made ludicrous by the supremely self confident bearing of the individual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0035.mp3|his speech was curt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0036.mp3|and he had a particularly impressive manner of keeping silent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0038.mp3|have you been out much to day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0039.mp3|no i stayed in bed all the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0040.mp3|answered the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0041.mp3|why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0046.mp3|but obviously intimidated by the little man's overwhelming air of unconcern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0048.mp3|however he ventured another question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0049.mp3|did you walk down here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0050.mp3|no omnibus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0051.mp3|the little man answered readily enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0052.mp3|he lived far away in islington|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0053.mp3|in a small house down a shabby street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0054.mp3|littered with straw and dirty paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0057.mp3|rowdy clamour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0058.mp3|his single back room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0059.mp3|remarkable for having an extremely large cupboard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0060.mp3|he rented furnished from two elderly spinsters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0062.mp3|he had a heavy padlock put on the cupboard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0063.mp3|but otherwise he was a model lodger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0064.mp3|giving no trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0065.mp3|and requiring practically no attendance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0067.mp3|and that when he went out he locked his door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0068.mp3|and took the key away with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0070.mp3|their self confident glitter falling here and there on the walls of houses or lowered upon the heads of the unconscious stream of people on the pavements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0072.mp3|of people running for life at the sight of those spectacles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0074.mp3|what a panic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0075.mp3|he murmured interrogatively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0076.mp3|been sitting long here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0077.mp3|an hour or more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0079.mp3|all his movements the way he grasped the mug|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0080.mp3|the act of drinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0081.mp3|the way he set the heavy glass down and folded his arms had a firmness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0083.mp3|leaning forward with staring eyes and protruding lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0084.mp3|look the picture of eager indecision|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0085.mp3|an hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0086.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0087.mp3|then it may be you haven't heard yet the news i've heard just now in the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0089.mp3|the little man shook his head negatively the least bit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0091.mp3|a newspaper boy had yelled the thing under his very nose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0092.mp3|and not being prepared for anything of that sort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0093.mp3|he was very much startled and upset|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0094.mp3|he had to come in there with a dry mouth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0095.mp3|i never thought of finding you here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0096.mp3|he added murmuring steadily with his elbows planted on the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0097.mp3|i come here sometimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0098.mp3|said the other preserving his provoking coolness of demeanour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0099.mp3|it's wonderful that you of all people should have heard nothing of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0101.mp3|his eyelids snapped nervously upon the shining eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0102.mp3|you of all people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0103.mp3|he repeated tentatively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0104.mp3|this obvious restraint argued an incredible and inexplicable timidity of the big fellow before the calm little man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0105.mp3|who again lifted the glass mug|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0107.mp3|and put it down with brusque and assured movements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0108.mp3|and that was all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0110.mp3|word or sign|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0111.mp3|that did not come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0112.mp3|made an effort to assume a sort of indifference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0113.mp3|do you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0115.mp3|give your stuff to anybody who's up to asking you for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0116.mp3|my absolute rule is never to refuse anybody as long as i have a pinch by me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0117.mp3|answered the little man with decision|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0118.mp3|that's a principle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0120.mp3|it's a principle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0121.mp3|and you think it's sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0122.mp3|the large round spectacles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0123.mp3|which gave a look of staring self confidence to the sallow face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0126.mp3|perfectly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0127.mp3|always|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0128.mp3|under every circumstance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0129.mp3|what could stop me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0130.mp3|why should i not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0131.mp3|why should i think twice about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0134.mp3|the other smiled faintly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0135.mp3|let them come and try it on and you will see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0136.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0137.mp3|they know me but i know also every one of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0138.mp3|they won't come near me not they|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0139.mp3|his thin livid lips snapped together firmly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0142.mp3|don't you see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0145.mp3|proof of what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0149.mp3|sickly face remained unchanged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0150.mp3|and the utterance was negligent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0151.mp3|i don't think there's one of them anxious to make that arrest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0152.mp3|i don't think they could get one of them to apply for a warrant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0153.mp3|i mean one of the best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0154.mp3|not one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0155.mp3|why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0157.mp3|because they know very well i take care never to part with the last handful of my wares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0159.mp3|he touched the breast of his coat lightly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0160.mp3|in a thick glass flask|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0161.mp3|he added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0162.mp3|so i have been told|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0164.mp3|but i didn't know if|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0165.mp3|they know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0166.mp3|interrupted the little man crisply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0167.mp3|leaning against the straight chair back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0168.mp3|which rose higher than his fragile head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0169.mp3|i shall never be arrested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0170.mp3|the game isn't good enough for any policeman of them all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0174.mp3|again his lips closed with a self confident snap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0176.mp3|or recklessness or simply ignorance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0177.mp3|he retorted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0179.mp3|i never affirmed i could not be eliminated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0180.mp3|rejoined the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0181.mp3|but that wouldn't be an arrest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0185.mp3|don't be too sure of that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0186.mp3|what's to prevent half a dozen of them jumping upon you from behind in the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0187.mp3|with your arms pinned to your sides you could do nothing could you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0188.mp3|yes i could|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0190.mp3|said the little man impassively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0191.mp3|and never very late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0192.mp3|i walk always with my right hand closed round the india rubber ball which i have in my trouser pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0195.mp3|the tube leads up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0197.mp3|resembling a slender brown worm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0198.mp3|issuing from the armhole of his waistcoat and plunging into the inner breast pocket of his jacket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0200.mp3|of a nondescript brown mixture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0202.mp3|dusty in the folds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0203.mp3|with ragged button holes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0204.mp3|the detonator is partly mechanical partly chemical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0205.mp3|he explained with casual condescension|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0206.mp3|it is instantaneous of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0209.mp3|confessed the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0210.mp3|with a reluctance which seemed to twist his mouth dolorously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0214.mp3|twenty seconds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0216.mp3|you mean to say that you could face that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0217.mp3|i should go crazy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0218.mp3|wouldn't matter if you did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0221.mp3|which is only for my own use|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0222.mp3|the worst is that the manner of exploding is always the weak point with us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0224.mp3|and even to unexpected changes of conditions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0225.mp3|a variable and yet perfectly precise mechanism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0226.mp3|a really intelligent detonator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0227.mp3|twenty seconds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0230.mp3|and then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0232.mp3|nobody in this room could hope to escape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0233.mp3|was the verdict of that survey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0234.mp3|nor yet this couple going up the stairs now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0235.mp3|the piano at the foot of the staircase clanged through a mazurka with brazen impetuosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0236.mp3|as though a vulgar and impudent ghost were showing off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0237.mp3|the keys sank and rose mysteriously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0238.mp3|then all became still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0240.mp3|he had such a distinct perception of ruin and death that he shuddered again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0241.mp3|the other observed with an air of calm sufficiency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0243.mp3|there are very few people in the world whose character is as well established as mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0244.mp3|i wonder how you managed it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0246.mp3|force of personality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0247.mp3|said the other without raising his voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0249.mp3|force of personality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0250.mp3|he repeated with ostentatious calm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0251.mp3|i have the means to make myself deadly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0254.mp3|is absolutely nothing in the way of protection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0255.mp3|what is effective is the belief those people have in my will to use the means|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0256.mp3|that's their impression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0257.mp3|it is absolute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0258.mp3|therefore i am deadly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0259.mp3|there are individuals of character amongst that lot too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0261.mp3|possibly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0262.mp3|but it is a matter of degree obviously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0264.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0265.mp3|i am not impressed by them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0266.mp3|therefore they are inferior|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0267.mp3|they cannot be otherwise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0268.mp3|their character is built upon conventional morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0269.mp3|it leans on the social order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0272.mp3|they depend on life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0274.mp3|in this connection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0275.mp3|is a historical fact surrounded by all sorts of restraints and considerations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0277.mp3|whereas i depend on death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0278.mp3|which knows no restraint and cannot be attacked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0279.mp3|my superiority is evident|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0280.mp3|this is a transcendental way of putting it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0284.mp3|mumbled the other contemptuously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0285.mp3|the delegate of the international red committee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0286.mp3|has been a posturing shadow all his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0288.mp3|i won't define the other two as you are one of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0289.mp3|but what you say means nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0291.mp3|but the trouble is not only that you are as unable to think independently as any respectable grocer or journalist of them all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0292.mp3|but that you have no character whatever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0294.mp3|but what do you want from us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0295.mp3|he exclaimed in a deadened voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0297.mp3|a perfect detonator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0298.mp3|was the peremptory answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0299.mp3|what are you making that face for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0300.mp3|you see you can't even bear the mention of something conclusive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0301.mp3|i am not making a face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0304.mp3|the other continued with leisurely self confidence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0305.mp3|are the slaves of the social convention which is afraid of you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0306.mp3|slaves of it as much as the very police that stands up in the defence of that convention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0310.mp3|and your action too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0311.mp3|and thus neither your thought nor your action can ever be conclusive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0315.mp3|endless silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0316.mp3|then almost immediately went on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0320.mp3|he looked at me very steadily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0321.mp3|but i did not look at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0322.mp3|why should i give him more than a glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0323.mp3|he was thinking of many things of his superiors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0324.mp3|of his reputation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0325.mp3|of the law courts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0326.mp3|of his salary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0327.mp3|of newspapers of a hundred things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0328.mp3|but i was thinking of my perfect detonator only|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0329.mp3|he meant nothing to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0331.mp3|like to like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0333.mp3|revolution legality counter moves in the same game|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0335.mp3|he plays his little game so do you propagandists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0336.mp3|but i don't play i work fourteen hours a day and go hungry sometimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0337.mp3|my experiments cost money now and again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0338.mp3|and then i must do without food for a day or two|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0339.mp3|you're looking at my beer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0340.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0341.mp3|i have had two glasses already and shall have another presently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0342.mp3|this is a little holiday and i celebrate it alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0343.mp3|why not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0344.mp3|i've the grit to work alone quite alone absolutely alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0345.mp3|i've worked alone for years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0348.mp3|he sneered very low|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0349.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0350.mp3|retorted the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0351.mp3|it is a good definition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0352.mp3|you couldn't find anything half so precise to define the nature of your activity with all your committees and delegations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0353.mp3|it is i who am the true propagandist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0354.mp3|we won't discuss that point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0356.mp3|i am afraid i'll have to spoil your holiday for you though|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0357.mp3|there's a man blown up in greenwich park this morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0359.mp3|they have been yelling the news in the streets since two o'clock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0360.mp3|i bought the paper and just ran in here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0361.mp3|then i saw you sitting at this table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0362.mp3|i've got it in my pocket now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0363.mp3|he pulled the newspaper out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0364.mp3|it was a good sized rosy sheet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0365.mp3|as if flushed by the warmth of its own convictions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0366.mp3|which were optimistic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0367.mp3|he scanned the pages rapidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0370.mp3|bomb in greenwich park|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0371.mp3|there isn't much so far|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0372.mp3|half past eleven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0374.mp3|effects of explosion felt as far as romney road and park place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0375.mp3|enormous hole in the ground under a tree filled with smashed roots and broken branches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0376.mp3|all round fragments of a man's body blown to pieces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0377.mp3|that's all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0379.mp3|no doubt a wicked attempt to blow up the observatory they say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0381.mp3|that's hardly credible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0382.mp3|he looked at the paper for a while longer in silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0383.mp3|then passed it to the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0384.mp3|who after gazing abstractedly at the print laid it down without comment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0386.mp3|the fragments of only one man you note|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0387.mp3|ergo blew himself up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0388.mp3|that spoils your day off for you don't it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0389.mp3|were you expecting that sort of move|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0392.mp3|the little man lifted his thin black eyebrows with dispassionate scorn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0395.mp3|what is crime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0396.mp3|what can be the meaning of such an assertion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0398.mp3|one must use the current words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0400.mp3|the meaning of this assertion is that this business may affect our position very adversely in this country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0401.mp3|isn't that crime enough for you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0402.mp3|i am convinced you have been giving away some of your stuff lately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0406.mp3|burst out the editor of the f p leaflets in an intense whisper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0409.mp3|for the asking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0410.mp3|to the first fool that comes along|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0412.mp3|the condemned social order has not been built up on paper and ink|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0413.mp3|and i don't fancy that a combination of paper and ink will ever put an end to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0414.mp3|whatever you may think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0419.mp3|i know what you are thinking about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0420.mp3|but i am not taking my cue from the red committee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0421.mp3|i would see you all hounded out of here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0422.mp3|or arrested or beheaded for that matter without turning a hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0423.mp3|what happens to us as individuals is not of the least consequence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0424.mp3|he spoke carelessly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0425.mp3|without heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0426.mp3|almost without feeling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0428.mp3|secretly much affected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0430.mp3|if the police here knew their business they would shoot you full of holes with revolvers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0432.mp3|the little man seemed already to have considered that point of view in his dispassionate self confident manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0433.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0434.mp3|he assented with the utmost readiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0435.mp3|but for that they would have to face their own institutions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0436.mp3|do you see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0437.mp3|that requires uncommon grit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0438.mp3|grit of a special kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0440.mp3|i fancy that's exactly what would happen to you if you were to set up your laboratory in the states|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0441.mp3|they don't stand on ceremony with their institutions there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0442.mp3|i am not likely to go and see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0443.mp3|otherwise your remark is just|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0444.mp3|admitted the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0445.mp3|they have more character over there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0446.mp3|and their character is essentially anarchistic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0447.mp3|fertile ground for us the states very good ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0448.mp3|the great republic has the root of the destructive matter in her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0449.mp3|the collective temperament is lawless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0451.mp3|they may shoot us down but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0455.mp3|protested the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0456.mp3|there are several kinds of logic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0457.mp3|this is the enlightened kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0458.mp3|america is all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0459.mp3|it is this country that is dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0460.mp3|with her idealistic conception of legality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0461.mp3|the social spirit of this people is wrapped up in scrupulous prejudices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0462.mp3|and that is fatal to our work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0463.mp3|you talk of england being our only refuge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0464.mp3|so much the worse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0466.mp3|what do we want with refuges|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0467.mp3|here you talk print plot and do nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0469.mp3|he shrugged his shoulders slightly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0470.mp3|then added with the same leisurely assurance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0471.mp3|to break up the superstition and worship of legality should be our aim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0472.mp3|nothing would please me more than to see inspector heat and his likes take to shooting us down in broad daylight with the approval of the public|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0473.mp3|half our battle would be won then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0474.mp3|the disintegration of the old morality would have set in in its very temple|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0475.mp3|that is what you ought to aim at|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0476.mp3|but you revolutionists will never understand that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0477.mp3|you plan the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0479.mp3|whereas what's wanted is a clean sweep and a clear start for a new conception of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0480.mp3|that sort of future will take care of itself if you will only make room for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0482.mp3|and as i haven't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0483.mp3|i do my best by perfecting a really dependable detonator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0485.mp3|who had been mentally swimming in deep waters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0486.mp3|seized upon the last word as if it were a saving plank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0488.mp3|your detonators|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0490.mp3|a shade of vexation darkened the determined sallow face confronting ossipon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0491.mp3|my difficulty consists precisely in experimenting practically with the various kinds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0492.mp3|they must be tried after all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0493.mp3|besides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0495.mp3|who could that fellow be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0496.mp3|i assure you that we in london had no knowledge couldn't you describe the person you gave the stuff to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0498.mp3|describe him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0499.mp3|he repeated slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0500.mp3|i don't think there can be the slightest objection now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0501.mp3|i will describe him to you in one word verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0503.mp3|whom curiosity had lifted a few inches off his seat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0505.mp3|as if hit in the face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0507.mp3|impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0508.mp3|the self possessed little man nodded slightly once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0509.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0510.mp3|he's the person|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0511.mp3|you can't say that in this case i was giving my stuff to the first fool that came along|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0512.mp3|he was a prominent member of the group as far as i understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0515.mp3|prominent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0516.mp3|no not exactly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0518.mp3|and usually received comrades coming over here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0520.mp3|man of no ideas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0521.mp3|years ago he used to speak at meetings in france i believe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0522.mp3|not very well though|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0524.mp3|the only talent he showed really was his ability to elude the attentions of the police somehow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0525.mp3|here for instance he did not seem to be looked after very closely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0526.mp3|he was regularly married you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0527.mp3|i suppose it's with her money that he started that shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0530.mp3|i wonder what that woman will do now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0531.mp3|and fell into thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0532.mp3|the other waited with ostentatious indifference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0533.mp3|his parentage was obscure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0534.mp3|and he was generally known only by his nickname of professor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0535.mp3|his title to that designation consisted in his having been once assistant demonstrator in chemistry at some technical institute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0536.mp3|he quarrelled with the authorities upon a question of unfair treatment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0538.mp3|there too he had been treated with revolting injustice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0539.mp3|his struggles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0540.mp3|his privations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0541.mp3|his hard work to raise himself in the social scale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0542.mp3|had filled him with such an exalted conviction of his merits that it was extremely difficult for the world to treat him with justice the standard of that notion depending so much upon the patience of the individual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0543.mp3|the professor had genius|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0544.mp3|but lacked the great social virtue of resignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0548.mp3|quite an ordinary personality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0551.mp3|he added in a reproving tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0552.mp3|did he say anything to you give you some idea of his intentions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0553.mp3|i hadn't seen him for a month|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0554.mp3|it seems impossible that he should be gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0555.mp3|he told me it was going to be a demonstration against a building|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0556.mp3|said the professor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0557.mp3|i had to know that much to prepare the missile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0558.mp3|i pointed out to him that i had hardly a sufficient quantity for a completely destructive result|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0559.mp3|but he pressed me very earnestly to do my best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0560.mp3|as he wanted something that could be carried openly in the hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0562.mp3|he was pleased at the idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0563.mp3|it gave me some trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0564.mp3|because i had to cut out the bottom first and solder it on again afterwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0565.mp3|when prepared for use|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0568.mp3|the detonator was connected with the screw top of the can|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0569.mp3|it was ingenious a combination of time and shock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0570.mp3|i explained the system to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0571.mp3|it was a thin tube of tin enclosing a|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0574.mp3|he interrupted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0577.mp3|which would make the connection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0578.mp3|and then forgot the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0579.mp3|it was set for twenty minutes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0580.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0581.mp3|the time contact being made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0582.mp3|a sharp shock would bring about the explosion at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0583.mp3|he either ran the time too close or simply let the thing fall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0584.mp3|the contact was made all right that's clear to me at any rate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0586.mp3|and yet you would think that a common fool in a hurry would be much more likely to forget to make the contact altogether|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0587.mp3|i was worrying myself about that sort of failure mostly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0588.mp3|but there are more kinds of fools than one can guard against|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0590.mp3|he beckoned to a waiter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0592.mp3|after the man had gone away with the money he roused himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0593.mp3|with an air of profound dissatisfaction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0594.mp3|it's extremely unpleasant for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0595.mp3|he mused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0596.mp3|karl has been in bed with bronchitis for a week|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0597.mp3|there's an even chance that he will never get up again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0599.mp3|a fashionable publisher has offered him five hundred pounds for a book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0600.mp3|it will be a ghastly failure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0601.mp3|he has lost the habit of consecutive thinking in prison you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0602.mp3|the professor on his feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0603.mp3|now buttoning his coat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0604.mp3|looked about him with perfect indifference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0607.mp3|he dreaded the blame of the central red committee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0608.mp3|a body which had no permanent place of abode|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0609.mp3|and of whose membership he was not exactly informed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0610.mp3|if this affair eventuated in the stoppage of the modest subsidy allotted to the publication of the f p pamphlets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0611.mp3|then indeed he would have to regret verloc's inexplicable folly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0612.mp3|solidarity with the extremest form of action is one thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0613.mp3|and silly recklessness is another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0614.mp3|he said with a sort of moody brutality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0615.mp3|i don't know what came to verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0616.mp3|there's some mystery there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0617.mp3|however he's gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0618.mp3|you may take it as you like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0619.mp3|but under the circumstances the only policy for the militant revolutionary group is to disclaim all connection with this damned freak of yours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0620.mp3|how to make the disclaimer convincing enough is what bothers me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0621.mp3|the little man on his feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0622.mp3|buttoned up and ready to go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0624.mp3|he levelled his spectacles at the latter's face point blank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0625.mp3|you might ask the police for a testimonial of good conduct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0626.mp3|they know where every one of you slept last night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0627.mp3|perhaps if you asked them they would consent to publish some sort of official statement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0628.mp3|no doubt they are aware well enough that we had nothing to do with this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0630.mp3|what they will say is another thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0631.mp3|he remained thoughtful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0632.mp3|disregarding the short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0634.mp3|shabby figure standing by his side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0635.mp3|i must lay hands on michaelis at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0636.mp3|and get him to speak from his heart at one of our gatherings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0637.mp3|the public has a sort of sentimental regard for that fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0638.mp3|his name is known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0639.mp3|and i am in touch with a few reporters on the big dailies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0641.mp3|but he has a turn of talk that makes it go down all the same|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0642.mp3|like treacle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0643.mp3|interjected the professor rather low keeping an impassive expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0645.mp3|after the manner of a man reflecting in perfect solitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0646.mp3|confounded ass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0647.mp3|to leave such an imbecile business on my hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0648.mp3|and i don't even know if|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0649.mp3|he sat with compressed lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0650.mp3|the idea of going for news straight to the shop lacked charm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0651.mp3|his notion was that verloc's shop might have been turned already into a police trap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0652.mp3|they will be bound to make some arrests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0653.mp3|he thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0654.mp3|with something resembling virtuous indignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0655.mp3|for the even tenor of his revolutionary life was menaced by no fault of his|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0656.mp3|and yet unless he went there he ran the risk of remaining in ignorance of what perhaps it would be very material for him to know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0657.mp3|then he reflected that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0658.mp3|if the man in the park had been so very much blown to pieces as the evening papers said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0659.mp3|he could not have been identified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0660.mp3|and if so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0664.mp3|there would be a lot of watching all round no matter where he went|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0666.mp3|i wonder what i had better do now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0667.mp3|he muttered taking counsel with himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0668.mp3|a rasping voice at his elbow said with sedate scorn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0670.mp3|after uttering these words the professor walked away from the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0672.mp3|whom that piece of insight had taken unawares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0673.mp3|gave one ineffectual start|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0674.mp3|and remained still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0675.mp3|with a helpless gaze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0676.mp3|as though nailed fast to the seat of his chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0677.mp3|the lonely piano|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0678.mp3|without as much as a music stool to help it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0679.mp3|struck a few chords courageously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0680.mp3|and beginning a selection of national airs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0681.mp3|played him out at last to the tune of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0683.mp3|the painfully detached notes grew faint behind his back while he went slowly upstairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0684.mp3|across the hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0685.mp3|and into the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0687.mp3|it was a raw gloomy day of the early spring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0688.mp3|and the grimy sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0689.mp3|the mud of the streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0690.mp3|the rags of the dirty men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0695.mp3|garnished like tapestry the sweep of the curbstone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0696.mp3|the trade in afternoon papers was brisk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0697.mp3|yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0698.mp3|in comparison with the swift|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0699.mp3|constant march of foot traffic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0700.mp3|the effect was of indifference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0701.mp3|of a disregarded distribution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_04_conrad_0703.mp3|but the professor was already out of sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0001.mp3|and walked along|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0002.mp3|with his head carried rigidly erect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0003.mp3|in a crowd whose every individual almost overtopped his stunted stature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0004.mp3|it was vain to pretend to himself that he was not disappointed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0005.mp3|but that was mere feeling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0006.mp3|the stoicism of his thought could not be disturbed by this or any other failure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0007.mp3|next time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0008.mp3|or the time after next|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0009.mp3|a telling stroke would be delivered something really startling a blow fit to open the first crack in the imposing front of the great edifice of legal conceptions sheltering the atrocious injustice of society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0010.mp3|of humble origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0011.mp3|and with an appearance really so mean as to stand in the way of his considerable natural abilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0012.mp3|his imagination had been fired early by the tales of men rising from the depths of poverty to positions of authority and affluence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0013.mp3|the extreme|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0014.mp3|almost ascetic purity of his thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0015.mp3|combined with an astounding ignorance of worldly conditions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0016.mp3|had set before him a goal of power and prestige to be attained without the medium of arts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0019.mp3|wealth by sheer weight of merit alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0020.mp3|on that view he considered himself entitled to undisputed success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0021.mp3|his father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0022.mp3|a delicate dark enthusiast with a sloping forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0023.mp3|had been an itinerant and rousing preacher of some obscure but rigid christian sect a man supremely confident in the privileges of his righteousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0025.mp3|individualist by temperament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0026.mp3|once the science of colleges had replaced thoroughly the faith of conventicles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0027.mp3|this moral attitude translated itself into a frenzied puritanism of ambition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0028.mp3|he nursed it as something secularly holy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0030.mp3|whose morality was artificial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0032.mp3|and blasphemous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0033.mp3|the way of even the most justifiable revolutions is prepared by personal impulses disguised into creeds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0034.mp3|the professor's indignation found in itself a final cause that absolved him from the sin of turning to destruction as the agent of his ambition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0035.mp3|to destroy public faith in legality was the imperfect formula of his pedantic fanaticism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0036.mp3|but the subconscious conviction that the framework of an established social order cannot be effectually shattered except by some form of collective or individual violence was precise and correct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0037.mp3|he was a moral agent that was settled in his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0038.mp3|by exercising his agency with ruthless defiance he procured for himself the appearances of power and personal prestige|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0039.mp3|that was undeniable to his vengeful bitterness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0040.mp3|it pacified its unrest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0041.mp3|and in their own way the most ardent of revolutionaries are perhaps doing no more but seeking for peace in common with the rest of mankind the peace of soothed vanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0042.mp3|of satisfied appetites|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0043.mp3|or perhaps of appeased conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0044.mp3|lost in the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0046.mp3|he meditated confidently on his power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0047.mp3|keeping his hand in the left pocket of his trousers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0049.mp3|the supreme guarantee of his sinister freedom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0050.mp3|but after a while he became disagreeably affected by the sight of the roadway thronged with vehicles and of the pavement crowded with men and women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0051.mp3|he was in a long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0052.mp3|straight street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0053.mp3|peopled by a mere fraction of an immense multitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0054.mp3|but all round him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0055.mp3|on and on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0056.mp3|even to the limits of the horizon hidden by the enormous piles of bricks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0057.mp3|he felt the mass of mankind mighty in its numbers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0058.mp3|they swarmed numerous like locusts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0059.mp3|industrious like ants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0060.mp3|thoughtless like a natural force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0061.mp3|pushing on blind and orderly and absorbed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0063.mp3|to logic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0064.mp3|to terror too perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0065.mp3|that was the form of doubt he feared most|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0066.mp3|impervious to fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0067.mp3|often while walking abroad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0068.mp3|when he happened also to come out of himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0069.mp3|he had such moments of dreadful and sane mistrust of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0070.mp3|what if nothing could move them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0071.mp3|such moments come to all men whose ambition aims at a direct grasp upon humanity to artists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0072.mp3|politicians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0076.mp3|a despicable emotional state this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0077.mp3|against which solitude fortifies a superior character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0078.mp3|and with severe exultation the professor thought of the refuge of his room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0080.mp3|lost in a wilderness of poor houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0081.mp3|the hermitage of the perfect anarchist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0082.mp3|in order to reach sooner the point where he could take his omnibus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0084.mp3|on one side the low brick houses had in their dusty windows the sightless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0085.mp3|moribund look of incurable decay empty shells awaiting demolition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0086.mp3|from the other side life had not departed wholly as yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0087.mp3|facing the only gas lamp yawned the cavern of a second hand furniture dealer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0088.mp3|where|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0089.mp3|deep in the gloom of a sort of narrow avenue winding through a bizarre forest of wardrobes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0090.mp3|with an undergrowth tangle of table legs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0091.mp3|a tall pier glass glimmered like a pool of water in a wood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0093.mp3|homeless couch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0094.mp3|accompanied by two unrelated chairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0095.mp3|stood in the open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0096.mp3|the only human being making use of the alley besides the professor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0098.mp3|checked his swinging pace suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0100.mp3|he said and stood a little on one side watchfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0101.mp3|the professor had already stopped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0102.mp3|with a ready half turn which brought his shoulders very near the other wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0103.mp3|his right hand fell lightly on the back of the outcast couch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0104.mp3|the left remained purposefully plunged deep in the trousers pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0107.mp3|it was like a meeting in a side corridor of a mansion full of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0108.mp3|the stalwart man was buttoned up in a dark overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0109.mp3|and carried an umbrella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0110.mp3|his hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0111.mp3|tilted back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0112.mp3|uncovered a good deal of forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0113.mp3|which appeared very white in the dusk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0114.mp3|in the dark patches of the orbits the eyeballs glimmered piercingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0117.mp3|the colour of ripe corn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0118.mp3|framed with their points the square block of his shaved chin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0119.mp3|i am not looking for you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0120.mp3|he said curtly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0121.mp3|the professor did not stir an inch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0122.mp3|the blended noises of the enormous town sank down to an inarticulate low murmur|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0123.mp3|chief inspector heat of the special crimes department changed his tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0124.mp3|not in a hurry to get home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0125.mp3|he asked with mocking simplicity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0126.mp3|the unwholesome looking little moral agent of destruction exulted silently in the possession of personal prestige|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0127.mp3|keeping in check this man armed with the defensive mandate of a menaced society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0129.mp3|who wished that the roman senate had only one head for the better satisfaction of his cruel lust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0130.mp3|he beheld in that one man all the forces he had set at defiance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0131.mp3|the force of law property oppression and injustice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0132.mp3|he beheld all his enemies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0133.mp3|and fearlessly confronted them all in a supreme satisfaction of his vanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0134.mp3|they stood perplexed before him as if before a dreadful portent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0135.mp3|he gloated inwardly over the chance of this meeting affirming his superiority over all the multitude of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0136.mp3|it was in reality a chance meeting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0137.mp3|chief inspector heat had had a disagreeably busy day since his department received the first telegram from greenwich a little before eleven in the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0138.mp3|first of all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0139.mp3|the fact of the outrage being attempted less than a week after he had assured a high official that no outbreak of anarchist activity was to be apprehended was sufficiently annoying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0140.mp3|if he ever thought himself safe in making a statement it was then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0141.mp3|he had made that statement with infinite satisfaction to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0142.mp3|because it was clear that the high official desired greatly to hear that very thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0143.mp3|he had affirmed that nothing of the sort could even be thought of without the department being aware of it within twenty four hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0144.mp3|and he had spoken thus in his consciousness of being the great expert of his department|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0145.mp3|he had gone even so far as to utter words which true wisdom would have kept back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0147.mp3|true wisdom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0148.mp3|which is not certain of anything in this world of contradictions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0149.mp3|would have prevented him from attaining his present position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0150.mp3|it would have alarmed his superiors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0151.mp3|and done away with his chances of promotion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0152.mp3|his promotion had been very rapid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0156.mp3|we know what each of them is doing hour by hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0157.mp3|he had declared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0158.mp3|and the high official had deigned to smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0160.mp3|the high official believed the declaration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0161.mp3|which chimed in with his idea of the fitness of things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0162.mp3|his wisdom was of an official kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0164.mp3|sudden holes in space and time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0165.mp3|a given anarchist may be watched inch by inch and minute by minute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0166.mp3|but a moment always comes when somehow all sight and touch of him are lost for a few hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0167.mp3|during which something generally an explosion more or less deplorable does happen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0168.mp3|but the high official|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0169.mp3|carried away by his sense of the fitness of things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0170.mp3|had smiled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0171.mp3|and now the recollection of that smile was very annoying to chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0172.mp3|principal expert in anarchist procedure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0173.mp3|this was not the only circumstance whose recollection depressed the usual serenity of the eminent specialist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0174.mp3|there was another dating back only to that very morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0175.mp3|the thought that when called urgently to his assistant commissioner's private room he had been unable to conceal his astonishment was distinctly vexing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0176.mp3|his instinct of a successful man had taught him long ago that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0178.mp3|a reputation is built on manner as much as on achievement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0179.mp3|and he felt that his manner when confronted with the telegram had not been impressive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0180.mp3|he had opened his eyes widely and had exclaimed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0181.mp3|impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0182.mp3|exposing himself thereby to the unanswerable retort of a finger tip laid forcibly on the telegram which the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0183.mp3|after reading it aloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0184.mp3|had flung on the desk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0187.mp3|under the tip of a forefinger was an unpleasant experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0188.mp3|very damaging too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0189.mp3|furthermore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0190.mp3|chief inspector heat was conscious of not having mended matters by allowing himself to express a conviction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0191.mp3|one thing i can tell you at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0193.mp3|he was strong in his integrity of a good detective|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0194.mp3|but he saw now that an impenetrably attentive reserve towards this incident would have served his reputation better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0195.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0196.mp3|he admitted to himself that it was difficult to preserve one's reputation if rank outsiders were going to take a hand in the business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0198.mp3|the tone of the assistant commissioner's remarks had been sour enough to set one's teeth on edge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0199.mp3|and since breakfast chief inspector heat had not managed to get anything to eat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0200.mp3|starting immediately to begin his investigation on the spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0202.mp3|unwholesome fog in the park|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0203.mp3|then he had walked over to the hospital|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0204.mp3|and when the investigation in greenwich was concluded at last he had lost his inclination for food|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0205.mp3|not accustomed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0206.mp3|as the doctors are|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0207.mp3|to examine closely the mangled remains of human beings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0208.mp3|he had been shocked by the sight disclosed to his view when a waterproof sheet had been lifted off a table in a certain apartment of the hospital|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0209.mp3|another waterproof sheet was spread over that table in the manner of a table cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0210.mp3|with the corners turned up over a sort of mound a heap of rags|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0211.mp3|scorched and bloodstained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0212.mp3|half concealing what might have been an accumulation of raw material for a cannibal feast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0213.mp3|it required considerable firmness of mind not to recoil before that sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0214.mp3|chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0215.mp3|an efficient officer of his department|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0216.mp3|stood his ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0217.mp3|but for a whole minute he did not advance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0218.mp3|a local constable in uniform cast a sidelong glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0219.mp3|and said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0220.mp3|with stolid simplicity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0221.mp3|he's all there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0222.mp3|every bit of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0223.mp3|it was a job|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0224.mp3|he had been the first man on the spot after the explosion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0225.mp3|he mentioned the fact again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0226.mp3|he had seen something like a heavy flash of lightning in the fog|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0227.mp3|at that time he was standing at the door of the king william street lodge talking to the keeper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0228.mp3|the concussion made him tingle all over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0229.mp3|he ran between the trees towards the observatory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0230.mp3|as fast as my legs would carry me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0231.mp3|he repeated twice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0232.mp3|chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0233.mp3|bending forward over the table in a gingerly and horrified manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0234.mp3|let him run on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0235.mp3|the hospital porter and another man turned down the corners of the cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0236.mp3|and stepped aside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0237.mp3|the chief inspector's eyes searched the gruesome detail of that heap of mixed things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0238.mp3|which seemed to have been collected in shambles and rag shops|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0239.mp3|you used a shovel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0240.mp3|he remarked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0241.mp3|observing a sprinkling of small gravel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0242.mp3|tiny brown bits of bark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0243.mp3|and particles of splintered wood as fine as needles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0244.mp3|had to in one place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0245.mp3|said the stolid constable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0249.mp3|the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0250.mp3|stooping guardedly over the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0251.mp3|fought down the unpleasant sensation in his throat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0252.mp3|the shattering violence of destruction which had made of that body a heap of nameless fragments affected his feelings with a sense of ruthless cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0253.mp3|though his reason told him the effect must have been as swift as a flash of lightning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0254.mp3|the man whoever he was had died instantaneously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0255.mp3|and yet it seemed impossible to believe that a human body could have reached that state of disintegration without passing through the pangs of inconceivable agony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0256.mp3|no physiologist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0257.mp3|and still less of a metaphysician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0258.mp3|chief inspector heat rose by the force of sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0259.mp3|which is a form of fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0260.mp3|above the vulgar conception of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0261.mp3|instantaneous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0262.mp3|he remembered all he had ever read in popular publications of long and terrifying dreams dreamed in the instant of waking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0263.mp3|of the whole past life lived with frightful intensity by a drowning man as his doomed head bobs up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0265.mp3|for the last time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0266.mp3|the inexplicable mysteries of conscious existence beset chief inspector heat till he evolved a horrible notion that ages of atrocious pain and mental torture could be contained between two successive winks of an eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0267.mp3|and meantime the chief inspector went on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0269.mp3|all the time his trained faculties of an excellent investigator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0270.mp3|who scorns no chance of information|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0271.mp3|followed the self satisfied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0273.mp3|a fair haired fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0274.mp3|the last observed in a placid tone and paused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0275.mp3|the old woman who spoke to the sergeant noticed a fair haired fellow coming out of maze hill station|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0277.mp3|and he was a fair haired fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0278.mp3|she noticed two men coming out of the station after the uptrain had gone on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0279.mp3|he continued slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0280.mp3|she couldn't tell if they were together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0281.mp3|she took no particular notice of the big one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0282.mp3|but the other was a fair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0284.mp3|carrying a tin varnish can in one hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0285.mp3|the constable ceased|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0287.mp3|muttered the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0288.mp3|with his eyes fixed on the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0291.mp3|she's housekeeper to a retired publican|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0292.mp3|and attends the chapel in park place sometimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0293.mp3|the constable uttered weightily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0295.mp3|with another oblique glance at the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0296.mp3|then suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0297.mp3|well here he is all of him i could see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0299.mp3|slight slight enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0300.mp3|look at that foot there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0301.mp3|i picked up the legs first one after another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0302.mp3|he was that scattered you didn't know where to begin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0303.mp3|the constable paused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0304.mp3|the least flicker of an innocent self laudatory smile invested his round face with an infantile expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0306.mp3|he announced positively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0307.mp3|i stumbled once myself and pitched on my head too while running up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0308.mp3|them roots do stick out all about the place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0309.mp3|stumbled against the root of a tree and fell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0312.mp3|the echo of the words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0313.mp3|person unknown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0314.mp3|repeating itself in his inner consciousness bothered the chief inspector considerably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0315.mp3|he would have liked to trace this affair back to its mysterious origin for his own information|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0316.mp3|he was professionally curious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0317.mp3|before the public he would have liked to vindicate the efficiency of his department by establishing the identity of that man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0318.mp3|he was a loyal servant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0319.mp3|that however appeared impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0320.mp3|the first term of the problem was unreadable lacked all suggestion but that of atrocious cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0321.mp3|overcoming his physical repugnance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0322.mp3|chief inspector heat stretched out his hand without conviction for the salving of his conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0323.mp3|and took up the least soiled of the rags|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0324.mp3|it was a narrow strip of velvet with a larger triangular piece of dark blue cloth hanging from it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0325.mp3|he held it up to his eyes and the police constable spoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0326.mp3|velvet collar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0327.mp3|funny the old woman should have noticed the velvet collar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0328.mp3|dark blue overcoat with a velvet collar she has told us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0329.mp3|he was the chap she saw and no mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0330.mp3|and here he is all complete velvet collar and all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0331.mp3|i don't think i missed a single piece as big as a postage stamp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0332.mp3|at this point the trained faculties of the chief inspector ceased to hear the voice of the constable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0333.mp3|he moved to one of the windows for better light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0334.mp3|his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0335.mp3|averted from the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0337.mp3|by a sudden jerk he detached it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0339.mp3|and flung the velvet collar back on the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0340.mp3|cover up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0341.mp3|he directed the attendants curtly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0342.mp3|without another look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0344.mp3|saluted by the constable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0345.mp3|carried off his spoil hastily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0346.mp3|a convenient train whirled him up to town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0347.mp3|alone and pondering deeply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0348.mp3|in a third class compartment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0349.mp3|that singed piece of cloth was incredibly valuable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0350.mp3|and he could not defend himself from astonishment at the casual manner it had come into his possession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0351.mp3|it was as if fate had thrust that clue into his hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0352.mp3|and after the manner of the average man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0353.mp3|whose ambition is to command events|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0354.mp3|he began to mistrust such a gratuitous and accidental success just because it seemed forced upon him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0355.mp3|the practical value of success depends not a little on the way you look at it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0356.mp3|but fate looks at nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0357.mp3|it has no discretion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0358.mp3|he no longer considered it eminently desirable all round to establish publicly the identity of the man who had blown himself up that morning with such horrible completeness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0359.mp3|but he was not certain of the view his department would take|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0360.mp3|a department is to those it employs a complex personality with ideas and even fads of its own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0361.mp3|it depends on the loyal devotion of its servants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0362.mp3|and the devoted loyalty of trusted servants is associated with a certain amount of affectionate contempt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0365.mp3|by a benevolent provision of nature no man is a hero to his valet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0366.mp3|or else the heroes would have to brush their own clothes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0367.mp3|likewise no department appears perfectly wise to the intimacy of its workers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0368.mp3|a department does not know so much as some of its servants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0369.mp3|being a dispassionate organism it can never be perfectly informed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0370.mp3|it would not be good for its efficiency to know too much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0371.mp3|chief inspector heat got out of the train in a state of thoughtfulness entirely untainted with disloyalty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0372.mp3|but not quite free of that jealous mistrust which so often springs on the ground of perfect devotion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0373.mp3|whether to women or to institutions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0374.mp3|it was in this mental disposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0375.mp3|physically very empty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0376.mp3|but still nauseated by what he had seen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0377.mp3|that he had come upon the professor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0380.mp3|this meeting was specially unwelcome to chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0381.mp3|he had not been thinking of the professor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0382.mp3|he had not been thinking of any individual anarchist at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0383.mp3|the complexion of that case had somehow forced upon him the general idea of the absurdity of things human|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0384.mp3|which in the abstract is sufficiently annoying to an unphilosophical temperament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0385.mp3|and in concrete instances becomes exasperating beyond endurance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0386.mp3|at the beginning of his career chief inspector heat had been concerned with the more energetic forms of thieving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0387.mp3|he had gained his spurs in that sphere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0388.mp3|and naturally enough had kept for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0389.mp3|after his promotion to another department|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0390.mp3|a feeling not very far removed from affection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0391.mp3|thieving was not a sheer absurdity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0392.mp3|it was a form of human industry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0393.mp3|perverse indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0394.mp3|but still an industry exercised in an industrious world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0395.mp3|it was work undertaken for the same reason as the work in potteries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0396.mp3|in coal mines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0397.mp3|in fields|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0398.mp3|in tool grinding shops|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0399.mp3|it was labour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0400.mp3|whose practical difference from the other forms of labour consisted in the nature of its risk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0402.mp3|or lead poisoning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0405.mp3|but in what may be briefly defined in its own special phraseology as|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0406.mp3|seven years hard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0407.mp3|chief inspector heat was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0409.mp3|not insensible to the gravity of moral differences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0410.mp3|but neither were the thieves he had been looking after|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0411.mp3|they submitted to the severe sanctions of a morality familiar to chief inspector heat with a certain resignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0412.mp3|they were his fellow citizens gone wrong because of imperfect education|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0413.mp3|chief inspector heat believed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0414.mp3|but allowing for that difference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0415.mp3|he could understand the mind of a burglar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0416.mp3|because|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0417.mp3|as a matter of fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0420.mp3|and have a working knowledge of each other's methods and of the routine of their respective trades|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0421.mp3|they understand each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0422.mp3|which is advantageous to both|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0423.mp3|and establishes a sort of amenity in their relations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0424.mp3|products of the same machine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0426.mp3|they take the machine for granted in different ways|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0427.mp3|but with a seriousness essentially the same|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0428.mp3|the mind of chief inspector heat was inaccessible to ideas of revolt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0429.mp3|but his thieves were not rebels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0431.mp3|his cool inflexible manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0432.mp3|his courage and his fairness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0433.mp3|had secured for him much respect and some adulation in the sphere of his early successes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0434.mp3|he had felt himself revered and admired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0435.mp3|and chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0437.mp3|gave a thought of regret to the world of thieves sane|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0438.mp3|without morbid ideals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0439.mp3|working by routine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0440.mp3|respectful of constituted authorities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0441.mp3|free from all taint of hate and despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0443.mp3|chief inspector heat felt very angry with himself for having stopped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0444.mp3|for having spoken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0445.mp3|for having taken that way at all on the ground of it being a short cut from the station to the headquarters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0446.mp3|and he spoke again in his big authoritative voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0448.mp3|being moderated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0449.mp3|had a threatening character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0450.mp3|you are not wanted i tell you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0451.mp3|he repeated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0452.mp3|the anarchist did not stir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0453.mp3|an inward laugh of derision uncovered not only his teeth but his gums as well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0454.mp3|shook him all over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0455.mp3|without the slightest sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0456.mp3|chief inspector heat was led to add against his better judgment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0457.mp3|not yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0458.mp3|when i want you i will know where to find you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0460.mp3|within the tradition and suitable to his character of a police officer addressing one of his special flock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0461.mp3|but the reception they got departed from tradition and propriety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0462.mp3|it was outrageous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0463.mp3|the stunted weakly figure before him spoke at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0464.mp3|i've no doubt the papers would give you an obituary notice then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0465.mp3|you know best what that would be worth to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0467.mp3|but you may be exposed to the unpleasantness of being buried together with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0468.mp3|though i suppose your friends would make an effort to sort us out as much as possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0469.mp3|with all his healthy contempt for the spirit dictating such speeches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0470.mp3|the atrocious allusiveness of the words had its effect on chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0471.mp3|he had too much insight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0472.mp3|and too much exact information as well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0474.mp3|the dusk of this narrow lane took on a sinister tint from the dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0475.mp3|frail little figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0477.mp3|and speaking with a weak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0478.mp3|self confident voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0480.mp3|tenacious vitality of the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0481.mp3|the physical wretchedness of that being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0482.mp3|so obviously not fit to live|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0483.mp3|was ominous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0484.mp3|for it seemed to him that if he had the misfortune to be such a miserable object he would not have cared how soon he died|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0485.mp3|life had such a strong hold upon him that a fresh wave of nausea broke out in slight perspiration upon his brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0486.mp3|the murmur of town life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0488.mp3|came through the curve of the sordid lane to his ears with a precious familiarity and an appealing sweetness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0489.mp3|he was human|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0490.mp3|but chief inspector heat was also a man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0491.mp3|and he could not let such words pass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0492.mp3|all this is good to frighten children with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0493.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0494.mp3|i'll have you yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0496.mp3|doubtless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0497.mp3|was the answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0498.mp3|but there's no time like the present believe me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0499.mp3|for a man of real convictions this is a fine opportunity of self sacrifice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0501.mp3|there isn't even a cat near us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0502.mp3|and these condemned old houses would make a good heap of bricks where you stand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0504.mp3|which you are paid to protect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0505.mp3|you don't know who you're speaking to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0506.mp3|said chief inspector heat firmly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0507.mp3|if i were to lay my hands on you now i would be no better than yourself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0510.mp3|it may yet be necessary to make people believe that some of you ought to be shot at sight like mad dogs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0511.mp3|then that will be the game|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0512.mp3|but i'll be damned if i know what yours is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0513.mp3|i don't believe you know yourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0514.mp3|you'll never get anything by it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0516.mp3|and you get it easily too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0517.mp3|i won't speak of your salary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0518.mp3|but haven't you made your name simply by not understanding what we are after|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0519.mp3|what are you after then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0520.mp3|asked chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0521.mp3|with scornful haste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0522.mp3|like a man in a hurry who perceives he is wasting his time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0523.mp3|the perfect anarchist answered by a smile which did not part his thin colourless lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0524.mp3|and the celebrated chief inspector felt a sense of superiority which induced him to raise a warning finger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0525.mp3|give it up whatever it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0526.mp3|he said in an admonishing tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0527.mp3|but not so kindly as if he were condescending to give good advice to a cracksman of repute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0528.mp3|give it up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0530.mp3|the fixed smile on the professor's lips wavered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0531.mp3|as if the mocking spirit within had lost its assurance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0532.mp3|chief inspector heat went on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0533.mp3|don't you believe me eh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0534.mp3|well you've only got to look about you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0536.mp3|and anyway you're not doing it well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0537.mp3|you're always making a mess of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0538.mp3|why if the thieves didn't know their work better they would starve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0539.mp3|the hint of an invincible multitude behind that man's back roused a sombre indignation in the breast of the professor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0540.mp3|he smiled no longer his enigmatic and mocking smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0541.mp3|the resisting power of numbers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0542.mp3|the unattackable stolidity of a great multitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0543.mp3|was the haunting fear of his sinister loneliness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0544.mp3|his lips trembled for some time before he managed to say in a strangled voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0546.mp3|that'll do now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0547.mp3|interrupted chief inspector heat hurriedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0548.mp3|and the professor laughed right out this time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0549.mp3|while still laughing he moved on but he did not laugh long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0551.mp3|miserable little man who emerged from the narrow passage into the bustle of the broad thoroughfare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0552.mp3|he walked with the nerveless gait of a tramp going on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0553.mp3|still going on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0554.mp3|indifferent to rain or sun in a sinister detachment from the aspects of sky and earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0557.mp3|after watching him for a while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0560.mp3|all the inhabitants of the immense town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0561.mp3|the population of the whole country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0562.mp3|and even the teeming millions struggling upon the planet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0565.mp3|the thieves themselves were sure to be with him in his present work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0566.mp3|the consciousness of universal support in his general activity heartened him to grapple with the particular problem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0567.mp3|the problem immediately before the chief inspector was that of managing the assistant commissioner of his department|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0568.mp3|his immediate superior|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0570.mp3|anarchism gave it its particular complexion but nothing more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0571.mp3|truth to say chief inspector heat thought but little of anarchism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0572.mp3|he did not attach undue importance to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0573.mp3|and could never bring himself to consider it seriously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0574.mp3|it had more the character of disorderly conduct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0575.mp3|disorderly without the human excuse of drunkenness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0576.mp3|which at any rate implies good feeling and an amiable leaning towards festivity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0577.mp3|as criminals anarchists were distinctly no class no class at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0578.mp3|and recalling the professor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0579.mp3|chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0580.mp3|without checking his swinging pace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0581.mp3|muttered through his teeth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0583.mp3|catching thieves was another matter altogether|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0584.mp3|it had that quality of seriousness belonging to every form of open sport where the best man wins under perfectly comprehensible rules|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0585.mp3|there were no rules for dealing with anarchists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0586.mp3|and that was distasteful to the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0587.mp3|it was all foolishness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0588.mp3|but that foolishness excited the public mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0589.mp3|affected persons in high places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0590.mp3|and touched upon international relations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0592.mp3|merciless contempt settled rigidly on the chief inspector's face as he walked on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0593.mp3|his mind ran over all the anarchists of his flock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0594.mp3|not one of them had half the spunk of this or that burglar he had known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0595.mp3|not half not one tenth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0596.mp3|at headquarters the chief inspector was admitted at once to the assistant commissioner's private room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0598.mp3|pen in hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0601.mp3|speaking tubes resembling snakes were tied by the heads to the back of the assistant commissioner's wooden arm chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0602.mp3|and their gaping mouths seemed ready to bite his elbows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0603.mp3|and in this attitude he raised only his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0604.mp3|whose lids were darker than his face and very much creased|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0605.mp3|the reports had come in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0606.mp3|every anarchist had been exactly accounted for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0607.mp3|after saying this he lowered his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0608.mp3|signed rapidly two single sheets of paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0609.mp3|and only then laid down his pen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0610.mp3|and sat well back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0611.mp3|directing an inquiring gaze at his renowned subordinate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0612.mp3|the chief inspector stood it well deferential but inscrutable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0614.mp3|said the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0616.mp3|i quite appreciate the excellent watch kept on them by your men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0617.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0619.mp3|for the public|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0620.mp3|does not amount to more than a confession of ignorance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0625.mp3|unless you have brought something useful from greenwich|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0626.mp3|he added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0627.mp3|the chief inspector began at once the account of his investigation in a clear matter of fact manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0628.mp3|his superior turning his chair a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0629.mp3|and crossing his thin legs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0630.mp3|leaned sideways on his elbow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0631.mp3|with one hand shading his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0632.mp3|his listening attitude had a sort of angular and sorrowful grace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0633.mp3|gleams as of highly burnished silver played on the sides of his ebony black head when he inclined it slowly at the end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0634.mp3|chief inspector heat waited with the appearance of turning over in his mind all he had just said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0636.mp3|as a matter of fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0637.mp3|considering the advisability of saying something more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0638.mp3|the assistant commissioner cut his hesitation short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0640.mp3|he asked without uncovering his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0641.mp3|the chief inspector thought it more than probable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0642.mp3|in his opinion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0643.mp3|the two men had parted from each other within a hundred yards from the observatory walls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0644.mp3|he explained also how the other man could have got out of the park speedily without being observed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0645.mp3|the fog though not very dense was in his favour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0646.mp3|he seemed to have escorted the other to the spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0647.mp3|and then to have left him there to do the job single handed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0648.mp3|taking the time those two were seen coming out of maze hill station by the old woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0649.mp3|and the time when the explosion was heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0650.mp3|the chief inspector thought that the other man might have been actually at the greenwich park station|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0651.mp3|ready to catch the next train up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0652.mp3|at the moment his comrade was destroying himself so thoroughly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0653.mp3|very thoroughly eh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0654.mp3|murmured the assistant commissioner from under the shadow of his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0655.mp3|the chief inspector in a few vigorous words described the aspect of the remains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0656.mp3|the coroner's jury will have a treat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0657.mp3|he added grimly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0658.mp3|the assistant commissioner uncovered his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0659.mp3|we shall have nothing to tell them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0660.mp3|he remarked languidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0661.mp3|he looked up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0663.mp3|his nature was one that is not easily accessible to illusions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0665.mp3|who have their own conceptions of loyalty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0666.mp3|his career had begun in a tropical colony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0667.mp3|he had liked his work there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0668.mp3|it was police work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0670.mp3|then he took his long leave and got married rather impulsively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0671.mp3|it was a good match from a worldly point of view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0673.mp3|on the other hand she had influential connections|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0674.mp3|it was an excellent match|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0675.mp3|but he did not like the work he had to do now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0676.mp3|he felt himself dependent on too many subordinates and too many masters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0677.mp3|the near presence of that strange emotional phenomenon called public opinion weighed upon his spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0678.mp3|and alarmed him by its irrational nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0679.mp3|no doubt that from ignorance he exaggerated to himself its power for good and evil especially for evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0681.mp3|the futility of office work especially appalled him on those days so trying to his sensitive liver|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0682.mp3|he got up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0683.mp3|unfolding himself to his full height|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0684.mp3|and with a heaviness of step remarkable in so slender a man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0685.mp3|moved across the room to the window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0686.mp3|the panes streamed with rain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0687.mp3|and the short street he looked down into lay wet and empty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0688.mp3|as if swept clear suddenly by a great flood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0689.mp3|it was a very trying day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0690.mp3|choked in raw fog to begin with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0691.mp3|and now drowned in cold rain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0693.mp3|blurred flames of gas lamps seemed to be dissolving in a watery atmosphere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0697.mp3|horrible horrible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0698.mp3|thought the assistant commissioner to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0699.mp3|with his face near the window pane|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0700.mp3|we have been having this sort of thing now for ten days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0701.mp3|no a fortnight a fortnight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0702.mp3|he ceased to think completely for a time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0703.mp3|that utter stillness of his brain lasted about three seconds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0704.mp3|then he said perfunctorily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0705.mp3|you have set inquiries on foot for tracing that other man up and down the line|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0706.mp3|he had no doubt that everything needful had been done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0709.mp3|thoroughly the business of man hunting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0713.mp3|a few inquiries amongst the ticket collectors and the porters of the two small railway stations would give additional details as to the appearance of the two men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0714.mp3|the inspection of the collected tickets would show at once where they came from that morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0715.mp3|it was elementary and could not have been neglected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0716.mp3|accordingly the chief inspector answered that all this had been done directly the old woman had come forward with her deposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0717.mp3|and he mentioned the name of a station|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0718.mp3|that's where they came from sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0719.mp3|he went on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0723.mp3|with a bright tin can in his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0725.mp3|all this agrees exactly with what the old woman told the police sergeant in greenwich|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0726.mp3|the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0727.mp3|still with his face turned to the window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0728.mp3|expressed his doubt as to these two men having had anything to do with the outrage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0729.mp3|all this theory rested upon the utterances of an old charwoman who had been nearly knocked down by a man in a hurry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0730.mp3|not a very substantial authority indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0731.mp3|unless on the ground of sudden inspiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0732.mp3|which was hardly tenable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0733.mp3|frankly now could she have been really inspired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0735.mp3|with grave irony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0736.mp3|keeping his back to the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0737.mp3|as if entranced by the contemplation of the town's colossal forms half lost in the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0739.mp3|providential|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0740.mp3|from the principal subordinate of his department|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0743.mp3|was familiar to the great public as that of one of its zealous and hard working protectors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0744.mp3|chief inspector heat raised his voice a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0745.mp3|strips and bits of bright tin were quite visible to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0746.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0747.mp3|that's a pretty good corroboration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0748.mp3|and these men came from that little country station|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0750.mp3|he was told that such was the name on two tickets out of three given up out of that train at maze hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0752.mp3|the chief inspector imparted that information in a tone of finality with some ill humour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0753.mp3|as loyal servants will do in the consciousness of their fidelity and with the sense of the value of their loyal exertions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0754.mp3|and still the assistant commissioner did not turn away from the darkness outside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0755.mp3|as vast as a sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0756.mp3|two foreign anarchists coming from that place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0757.mp3|he said apparently to the window pane|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0759.mp3|yes sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0760.mp3|but it would be still more unaccountable if that michaelis weren't staying in a cottage in the neighbourhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0761.mp3|at the sound of that name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0762.mp3|falling unexpectedly into this annoying affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0764.mp3|it was the most comforting habit of his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0765.mp3|in a mainly successful display of his skill without the assistance of any subordinate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0766.mp3|he entered his club to play from five to seven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0767.mp3|before going home to dinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0768.mp3|forgetting for those two hours whatever was distasteful in his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0771.mp3|a silent elderly barrister with malicious little eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0773.mp3|simple minded old colonel with nervous brown hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0774.mp3|they were his club acquaintances merely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0775.mp3|he never met them elsewhere except at the card table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0776.mp3|but they all seemed to approach the game in the spirit of co sufferers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0777.mp3|as if it were indeed a drug against the secret ills of existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0778.mp3|and every day as the sun declined over the countless roofs of the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0780.mp3|pleasurable impatience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0781.mp3|resembling the impulse of a sure and profound friendship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0782.mp3|lightened his professional labours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0783.mp3|and now this pleasurable sensation went out of him with something resembling a physical shock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0784.mp3|and was replaced by a special kind of interest in his work of social protection an improper sort of interest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_05_conrad_0785.mp3|which may be defined best as a sudden and alert mistrust of the weapon in his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0002.mp3|was one of the most influential and distinguished connections of the assistant commissioner's wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0003.mp3|whom she called annie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0004.mp3|and treated still rather as a not very wise and utterly inexperienced young girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0005.mp3|but she had consented to accept him on a friendly footing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0006.mp3|which was by no means the case with all of his wife's influential connections|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0007.mp3|married young and splendidly at some remote epoch of the past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0008.mp3|she had had for a time a close view of great affairs and even of some great men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0009.mp3|she herself was a great lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0010.mp3|old now in the number of her years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0011.mp3|she had that sort of exceptional temperament which defies time with scornful disregard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0012.mp3|as if it were a rather vulgar convention submitted to by the mass of inferior mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0013.mp3|many other conventions easier to set aside alas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0014.mp3|failed to obtain her recognition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0015.mp3|also on temperamental grounds either because they bored her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0017.mp3|admiration was a sentiment unknown to her it was one of the secret griefs of her most noble husband against her first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0018.mp3|as always more or less tainted with mediocrity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0019.mp3|and next as being in a way an admission of inferiority|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0020.mp3|and both were frankly inconceivable to her nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0021.mp3|to be fearlessly outspoken in her opinions came easily to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0022.mp3|since she judged solely from the standpoint of her social position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0023.mp3|she was equally untrammelled in her actions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0024.mp3|and as her tactfulness proceeded from genuine humanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0025.mp3|her bodily vigour remained remarkable and her superiority was serene and cordial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0026.mp3|three generations had admired her infinitely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0027.mp3|and the last she was likely to see had pronounced her a wonderful woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0028.mp3|meantime intelligent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0029.mp3|with a sort of lofty simplicity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0030.mp3|and curious at heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0031.mp3|but not like many women merely of social gossip|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0032.mp3|she amused her age by attracting within her ken through the power of her great|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0034.mp3|social prestige everything that rose above the dead level of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0035.mp3|lawfully or unlawfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0036.mp3|by position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0039.mp3|fortune or misfortune|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0040.mp3|royal highnesses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0042.mp3|men of science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0044.mp3|and charlatans of all ages and conditions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0047.mp3|bobbing up like corks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0048.mp3|show best the direction of the surface currents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0049.mp3|had been welcomed in that house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0051.mp3|penetrated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0054.mp3|for her own edification|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0055.mp3|in her own words she liked to watch what the world was coming to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0056.mp3|and as she had a practical mind her judgment of men and things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0057.mp3|though based on special prejudices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0058.mp3|was seldom totally wrong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0059.mp3|and almost never wrong headed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0061.mp3|who had brought michaelis there one afternoon the assistant commissioner did not remember very well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0062.mp3|he had a notion it must have been a certain member of parliament of illustrious parentage and unconventional sympathies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0063.mp3|which were the standing joke of the comic papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0064.mp3|the notabilities and even the simple notorieties of the day brought each other freely to that temple of an old woman's not ignoble curiosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0067.mp3|with its hum of voices and the groups of people seated or standing in the light of six tall windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0068.mp3|michaelis had been the object of a revulsion of popular sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0070.mp3|the plan of the conspirators had been to shoot down the horses and overpower the escort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0073.mp3|and the death of that man aroused through the length and breadth of a realm for whose defence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0076.mp3|an outburst of furious indignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0077.mp3|of a raging implacable pity for the victim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0078.mp3|three ring leaders got hanged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0079.mp3|michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0080.mp3|young and slim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0081.mp3|locksmith by trade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0082.mp3|and great frequenter of evening schools|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0083.mp3|did not even know that anybody had been killed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0084.mp3|his part with a few others being to force open the door at the back of the special conveyance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0085.mp3|when arrested he had a bunch of skeleton keys in one pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0086.mp3|a heavy chisel in another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0088.mp3|neither more nor less than a burglar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0089.mp3|but no burglar would have received such a heavy sentence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0090.mp3|the death of the constable had made him miserable at heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0091.mp3|but the failure of the plot also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0094.mp3|the judge on passing sentence commented feelingly upon the depravity and callousness of the young prisoner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0095.mp3|that made the groundless fame of his condemnation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0096.mp3|the fame of his release was made for him on no better grounds by people who wished to exploit the sentimental aspect of his imprisonment either for purposes of their own or for no intelligible purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0097.mp3|he let them do so in the innocence of his heart and the simplicity of his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0098.mp3|nothing that happened to him individually had any importance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0099.mp3|he was like those saintly men whose personality is lost in the contemplation of their faith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0100.mp3|his ideas were not in the nature of convictions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0101.mp3|they were inaccessible to reasoning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0102.mp3|they formed in all their contradictions and obscurities an invincible and humanitarian creed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0103.mp3|which he confessed rather than preached|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0104.mp3|with an obstinate gentleness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0105.mp3|a smile of pacific assurance on his lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0106.mp3|and his candid blue eyes cast down because the sight of faces troubled his inspiration developed in solitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0107.mp3|in that characteristic attitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0108.mp3|pathetic in his grotesque and incurable obesity which he had to drag like a galley slave's bullet to the end of his days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0110.mp3|he sat there by the head of the old lady's couch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0111.mp3|mild voiced and quiet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0112.mp3|with no more self consciousness than a very small child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0113.mp3|and with something of a child's charm the appealing charm of trustfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0114.mp3|confident of the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0115.mp3|whose secret ways had been revealed to him within the four walls of a well known penitentiary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0116.mp3|he had no reason to look with suspicion upon anybody|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0117.mp3|if he could not give the great and curious lady a very definite idea as to what the world was coming to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0118.mp3|he had managed without effort to impress her by his unembittered faith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0119.mp3|by the sterling quality of his optimism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0120.mp3|a certain simplicity of thought is common to serene souls at both ends of the social scale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0121.mp3|the great lady was simple in her own way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0123.mp3|since she judged them from the standpoint of her lofty position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0124.mp3|indeed her sympathies were easily accessible to a man of that sort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0125.mp3|she was not an exploiting capitalist herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0127.mp3|and she had a great capacity of pity for the more obvious forms of common human miseries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0128.mp3|precisely because she was such a complete stranger to them that she had to translate her conception into terms of mental suffering before she could grasp the notion of their cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0129.mp3|the assistant commissioner remembered very well the conversation between these two|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0130.mp3|he had listened in silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0131.mp3|it was something as exciting in a way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0132.mp3|and even touching in its foredoomed futility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0133.mp3|as the efforts at moral intercourse between the inhabitants of remote planets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0134.mp3|but this grotesque incarnation of humanitarian passion appealed somehow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0135.mp3|to one's imagination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0136.mp3|at last michaelis rose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0137.mp3|and taking the great lady's extended hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0139.mp3|retained it for a moment in his great cushioned palm with unembarrassed friendliness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0140.mp3|and turned upon the semi private nook of the drawing room his back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0141.mp3|vast and square|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0142.mp3|and as if distended under the short tweed jacket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0143.mp3|glancing about in serene benevolence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0144.mp3|he waddled along to the distant door between the knots of other visitors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0145.mp3|the murmur of conversations paused on his passage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0148.mp3|whose eyes met his accidentally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0149.mp3|and went out unconscious of the glances following him across the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0152.mp3|grave or light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0153.mp3|only a well set up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0155.mp3|active looking man of forty talking with two ladies near a window remarked aloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0156.mp3|with an unexpected depth of feeling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0157.mp3|eighteen stone i should say and not five foot six|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0158.mp3|poor fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0159.mp3|it's terrible terrible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0160.mp3|the lady of the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0161.mp3|gazing absently at the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0162.mp3|left alone with her on the private side of the screen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0163.mp3|seemed to be rearranging her mental impressions behind her thoughtful immobility of a handsome old face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0166.mp3|vaguely smiling countenances approached|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0167.mp3|circling round the screen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0168.mp3|two mature women with a matronly air of gracious resolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0169.mp3|a clean shaved individual with sunken cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0170.mp3|and dangling a gold mounted eyeglass on a broad black ribbon with an old world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0172.mp3|a silence deferential|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0173.mp3|but full of reserves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0174.mp3|reigned for a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0175.mp3|and then the great lady exclaimed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0176.mp3|not with resentment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0177.mp3|but with a sort of protesting indignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0178.mp3|and that officially is supposed to be a revolutionist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0179.mp3|what nonsense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0180.mp3|she looked hard at the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0181.mp3|who murmured apologetically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0182.mp3|not a dangerous one perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0183.mp3|not dangerous i should think not indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0184.mp3|he is a mere believer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0185.mp3|it's the temperament of a saint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0186.mp3|declared the great lady in a firm tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0187.mp3|and they kept him shut up for twenty years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0188.mp3|one shudders at the stupidity of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0190.mp3|his parents are dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0191.mp3|the girl he was to marry has died while he was in prison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0192.mp3|he has lost the skill necessary for his manual occupation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0193.mp3|he told me all this himself with the sweetest patience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0195.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0197.mp3|a pretty compensation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0199.mp3|she continued in a slightly bantering voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0200.mp3|while the banal society smiles hardened on the worldly faces turned towards her with conventional deference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0201.mp3|the poor creature is obviously no longer in a position to take care of himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0202.mp3|somebody will have to look after him a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0203.mp3|he should be recommended to follow a treatment of some sort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0204.mp3|the soldierly voice of the active looking man was heard advising earnestly from a distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0205.mp3|he was in the pink of condition for his age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0206.mp3|and even the texture of his long frock coat had a character of elastic soundness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0207.mp3|as if it were a living tissue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0208.mp3|the man is virtually a cripple|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0209.mp3|he added with unmistakable feeling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0210.mp3|other voices as if glad of the opening murmured hasty compassion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0211.mp3|quite startling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0213.mp3|most painful to see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0216.mp3|pronounced mincingly the word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0217.mp3|grotesque|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0218.mp3|whose justness was appreciated by those standing near him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0219.mp3|they smiled at each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0221.mp3|his position making it impossible for him to ventilate any independent view of a ticket of leave convict|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0224.mp3|he shared the view of his wife's friend and patron that michaelis was a humanitarian sentimentalist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0225.mp3|a little mad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0226.mp3|but upon the whole incapable of hurting a fly intentionally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0228.mp3|and his mind reverted at once to the old lady's well established infatuation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0230.mp3|it was a deep calm convinced infatuation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0231.mp3|she had not only felt him to be inoffensive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0232.mp3|but she had said so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0234.mp3|it was as if the monstrosity of the man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0235.mp3|with his candid infant's eyes and a fat angelic smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0236.mp3|had fascinated her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0237.mp3|she had come to believe almost his theory of the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0238.mp3|since it was not repugnant to her prejudices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0240.mp3|and industrialism as a method of human development appeared to her singularly repulsive in its mechanical and unfeeling character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0241.mp3|the humanitarian hopes of the mild michaelis tended not towards utter destruction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0242.mp3|but merely towards the complete economic ruin of the system|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0243.mp3|and she did not really see where was the moral harm of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0246.mp3|whom she disliked and mistrusted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0247.mp3|not because they had arrived anywhere she denied that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0248.mp3|but because of their profound unintelligence of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0250.mp3|with the annihilation of all capital they would vanish too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0251.mp3|but universal ruin providing it was universal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0252.mp3|as it was revealed to michaelis would leave the social values untouched|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0253.mp3|the disappearance of the last piece of money could not affect people of position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0254.mp3|she could not conceive how it could affect her position for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0255.mp3|she had developed these discoveries to the assistant commissioner with all the serene fearlessness of an old woman who had escaped the blight of indifference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0256.mp3|he had made for himself the rule to receive everything of that sort in a silence which he took care from policy and inclination not to make offensive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0257.mp3|he had an affection for the aged disciple of michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0258.mp3|a complex sentiment depending a little on her prestige|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0259.mp3|on her personality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0260.mp3|but most of all on the instinct of flattered gratitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0261.mp3|he felt himself really liked in her house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0262.mp3|she was kindness personified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0263.mp3|and she was practically wise too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0264.mp3|after the manner of experienced women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0266.mp3|her influence upon his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0267.mp3|a woman devoured by all sorts of small selfishnesses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0268.mp3|small envies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0269.mp3|small jealousies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0270.mp3|was excellent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0271.mp3|unfortunately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0272.mp3|both her kindness and her wisdom were of unreasonable complexion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0273.mp3|distinctly feminine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0274.mp3|and difficult to deal with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0275.mp3|she remained a perfect woman all along her full tale of years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0277.mp3|pestilential old man in petticoats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0278.mp3|and it was as of a woman that he thought of her the specially choice incarnation of the feminine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0282.mp3|true or fraudulent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0284.mp3|appreciating the distinguished and good friend of his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0287.mp3|the assistant commissioner became alarmed at the convict michaelis' possible fate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0288.mp3|once arrested on suspicion of being in some way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0289.mp3|however remote|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0290.mp3|a party to this outrage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0291.mp3|the man could hardly escape being sent back to finish his sentence at least|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0292.mp3|and that would kill him he would never come out alive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0293.mp3|the assistant commissioner made a reflection extremely unbecoming his official position without being really creditable to his humanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0294.mp3|if the fellow is laid hold of again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0295.mp3|he thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0296.mp3|she will never forgive me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0297.mp3|the frankness of such a secretly outspoken thought could not go without some derisive self criticism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0298.mp3|no man engaged in a work he does not like can preserve many saving illusions about himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0299.mp3|the distaste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0300.mp3|the absence of glamour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0301.mp3|extend from the occupation to the personality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0303.mp3|the assistant commissioner did not like his work at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0305.mp3|his real abilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0306.mp3|which were mainly of an administrative order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0307.mp3|were combined with an adventurous disposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0308.mp3|chained to a desk in the thick of four millions of men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0309.mp3|he considered himself the victim of an ironic fate the same|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0311.mp3|which had brought about his marriage with a woman exceptionally sensitive in the matter of colonial climate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0313.mp3|though he judged his alarm sardonically he did not dismiss the improper thought from his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0314.mp3|the instinct of self preservation was strong within him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0315.mp3|on the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0316.mp3|he repeated it mentally with profane emphasis and a fuller precision|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0319.mp3|and she'll never forgive me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0321.mp3|narrow figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0323.mp3|remained motionless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0324.mp3|the silence had lasted such a long time that chief inspector heat ventured to clear his throat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0325.mp3|this noise produced its effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0326.mp3|the zealous and intelligent officer was asked by his superior|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0327.mp3|whose back remained turned to him immovably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0328.mp3|you connect michaelis with this affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0329.mp3|chief inspector heat was very positive but cautious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0331.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0332.mp3|we have enough to go upon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0333.mp3|a man like that has no business to be at large anyhow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0334.mp3|you will want some conclusive evidence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0335.mp3|came the observation in a murmur|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0336.mp3|chief inspector heat raised his eyebrows at the black|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0338.mp3|which remained obstinately presented to his intelligence and his zeal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0339.mp3|there will be no difficulty in getting up sufficient evidence against him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0340.mp3|he said with virtuous complacency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0341.mp3|you may trust me for that sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0344.mp3|it was impossible to say yet whether it would roar or not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0345.mp3|that in the last instance depended of course on the newspaper press|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0346.mp3|but in any case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0347.mp3|chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0348.mp3|purveyor of prisons by trade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0349.mp3|and a man of legal instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0350.mp3|did logically believe that incarceration was the proper fate for every declared enemy of the law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0351.mp3|in the strength of that conviction he committed a fault of tact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0353.mp3|trust me for that sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0354.mp3|this was too much for the forced calmness under which the assistant commissioner had for upwards of eighteen months concealed his irritation with the system and the subordinates of his office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0355.mp3|a square peg forced into a round hole|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0356.mp3|he had felt like a daily outrage that long established smooth roundness into which a man of less sharply angular shape would have fitted himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0357.mp3|with voluptuous acquiescence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0358.mp3|after a shrug or two|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0359.mp3|what he resented most was just the necessity of taking so much on trust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0362.mp3|he caught on the latter's face not only the complacency proper to the occasion lurking under the moustache|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0363.mp3|but the vestiges of experimental watchfulness in the round eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0364.mp3|which had been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0366.mp3|fastened on his back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0368.mp3|the assistant commissioner of police had really some qualifications for his post|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0369.mp3|suddenly his suspicion was awakened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0371.mp3|if it ever slumbered from sheer weariness it was but lightly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0372.mp3|and his appreciation of chief inspector heat's zeal and ability|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0373.mp3|moderate in itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0374.mp3|excluded all notion of moral confidence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0375.mp3|he's up to something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0376.mp3|he exclaimed mentally and at once became angry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0377.mp3|crossing over to his desk with headlong strides he sat down violently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0378.mp3|here i am stuck in a litter of paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0379.mp3|he reflected with unreasonable resentment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0380.mp3|supposed to hold all the threads in my hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0382.mp3|and nothing else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0383.mp3|and they can fasten the other ends of the threads where they please|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0384.mp3|he raised his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0386.mp3|meagre face with the accentuated features of an energetic don quixote|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0387.mp3|now what is it you've got up your sleeve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0388.mp3|the other stared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0389.mp3|he stared without winking in a perfect immobility of his round eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0390.mp3|as he was used to stare at the various members of the criminal class when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0391.mp3|after being duly cautioned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0392.mp3|they made their statements in the tones of injured innocence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0393.mp3|or false simplicity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0394.mp3|or sullen resignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0395.mp3|but behind that professional and stony fixity there was some surprise too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0396.mp3|for in such a tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0397.mp3|combining nicely the note of contempt and impatience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0398.mp3|chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0399.mp3|the right hand man of the department|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0400.mp3|was not used to be addressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0401.mp3|he began in a procrastinating manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0402.mp3|like a man taken unawares by a new and unexpected experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0403.mp3|what i've got against that man michaelis you mean sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0404.mp3|the assistant commissioner watched the bullet head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0405.mp3|the points of that norse rover's moustache|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0406.mp3|falling below the line of the heavy jaw|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0408.mp3|whose determined character was marred by too much flesh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0409.mp3|at the cunning wrinkles radiating from the outer corners of the eyes and in that purposeful contemplation of the valuable and trusted officer he drew a conviction so sudden that it moved him like an inspiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0410.mp3|i have reason to think that when you came into this room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0411.mp3|he said in measured tones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0412.mp3|it was not michaelis who was in your mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0413.mp3|not principally perhaps not at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0415.mp3|muttered chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0416.mp3|with every appearance of astonishment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0417.mp3|which up to a certain point was genuine enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0418.mp3|he had discovered in this affair a delicate and perplexing side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0419.mp3|forcing upon the discoverer a certain amount of insincerity that sort of insincerity which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0420.mp3|under the names of skill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0422.mp3|discretion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0423.mp3|turns up at one point or another in most human affairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0424.mp3|he felt at the moment like a tight rope artist might feel if suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0425.mp3|in the middle of the performance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0426.mp3|the manager of the music hall were to rush out of the proper managerial seclusion and begin to shake the rope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0427.mp3|indignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0428.mp3|the sense of moral insecurity engendered by such a treacherous proceeding joined to the immediate apprehension of a broken neck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0430.mp3|in the colloquial phrase|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0431.mp3|put him in a state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0433.mp3|since a man must identify himself with something more tangible than his own personality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0434.mp3|and establish his pride somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0435.mp3|either in his social position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0436.mp3|or in the quality of the work he is obliged to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0438.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0439.mp3|said the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0440.mp3|i have|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0441.mp3|i do not mean to say that you have not thought of michaelis at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0444.mp3|if that is really the track of discovery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0445.mp3|why haven't you followed it up at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0446.mp3|either personally or by sending one of your men to that village|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0448.mp3|the chief inspector asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0449.mp3|in a tone which he sought to make simply reflective|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0450.mp3|forced unexpectedly to concentrate his faculties upon the task of preserving his balance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0451.mp3|he had seized upon that point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0452.mp3|and exposed himself to a rebuke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0454.mp3|the assistant commissioner frowning slightly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0455.mp3|observed that this was a very improper remark to make|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0456.mp3|but since you've made it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0457.mp3|he continued coldly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0458.mp3|i'll tell you that this is not my meaning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0460.mp3|with a straight glance of his sunken eyes which was a full equivalent of the unspoken termination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0461.mp3|and you know it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0462.mp3|the head of the so called special crimes department debarred by his position from going out of doors personally in quest of secrets locked up in guilty breasts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0463.mp3|had a propensity to exercise his considerable gifts for the detection of incriminating truth upon his own subordinates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0464.mp3|that peculiar instinct could hardly be called a weakness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0465.mp3|it was natural|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0466.mp3|he was a born detective|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0467.mp3|it had unconsciously governed his choice of a career|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0468.mp3|and if it ever failed him in life it was perhaps in the one exceptional circumstance of his marriage which was also natural|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0470.mp3|since it could not roam abroad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0471.mp3|upon the human material which was brought to it in its official seclusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0472.mp3|we can never cease to be ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0473.mp3|his elbow on the desk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0474.mp3|his thin legs crossed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0476.mp3|the assistant commissioner in charge of the special crimes branch was getting hold of the case with growing interest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0477.mp3|his chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0478.mp3|if not an absolutely worthy foeman of his penetration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0479.mp3|was at any rate the most worthy of all within his reach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0480.mp3|a mistrust of established reputations was strictly in character with the assistant commissioner's ability as detector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0481.mp3|his memory evoked a certain old fat and wealthy native chief in the distant colony whom it was a tradition for the successive colonial governors to trust and make much of as a firm friend and supporter of the order and legality established by white men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0484.mp3|he was found out to be principally his own good friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0485.mp3|and nobody else's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0486.mp3|not precisely a traitor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0487.mp3|but still a man of many dangerous reservations in his fidelity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0488.mp3|caused by a due regard for his own advantage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0491.mp3|a fellow of some innocence in his naive duplicity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0492.mp3|but none the less dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0493.mp3|he took some finding out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0494.mp3|he was physically a big man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0498.mp3|it was not the eyes nor yet the lips exactly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0499.mp3|it was bizarre|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0500.mp3|but does not alfred wallace relate in his famous book on the malay archipelago how|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0502.mp3|he discovered in an old and naked savage with a sooty skin a peculiar resemblance to a dear friend at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0503.mp3|for the first time since he took up his appointment the assistant commissioner felt as if he were going to do some real work for his salary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0504.mp3|and that was a pleasurable sensation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0505.mp3|i'll turn him inside out like an old glove|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0506.mp3|thought the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0507.mp3|with his eyes resting pensively upon chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0508.mp3|no that was not my thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0509.mp3|he began again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0510.mp3|there is no doubt about you knowing your business no doubt at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0511.mp3|and that's precisely why i|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0512.mp3|he stopped short and changing his tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0513.mp3|what could you bring up against michaelis of a definite nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0517.mp3|with that sort of man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0518.mp3|said the chief inspector with returning composure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0519.mp3|the slight approving movement of the assistant commissioner's head went far to pacify the resentful astonishment of the renowned officer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0521.mp3|an excellent husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0522.mp3|a devoted father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0525.mp3|there had been three in his time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0529.mp3|red faced person|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0530.mp3|with white eyebrows and an explosive temper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0531.mp3|could be managed with a silken thread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0532.mp3|he left on reaching the age limit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0533.mp3|the second|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0534.mp3|a perfect gentleman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0535.mp3|knowing his own and everybody else's place to a nicety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0536.mp3|on resigning to take up a higher appointment out of england got decorated for really inspector heat's services|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0537.mp3|to work with him had been a pride and a pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0538.mp3|the third|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0539.mp3|a bit of a dark horse from the first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0540.mp3|was at the end of eighteen months something of a dark horse still to the department|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0541.mp3|upon the whole chief inspector heat believed him to be in the main harmless odd looking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0542.mp3|but harmless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0543.mp3|he was speaking now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0544.mp3|and the chief inspector listened with outward deference which means nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0545.mp3|being a matter of duty and inwardly with benevolent toleration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0549.mp3|and what may he be doing there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0550.mp3|continued the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0551.mp3|who was perfectly informed on that point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0552.mp3|fitted with painful tightness into an old wooden arm chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0556.mp3|autobiography of a prisoner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0557.mp3|which was to be like a book of revelation in the history of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0558.mp3|the conditions of confined space|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0560.mp3|and solitude in a small four roomed cottage were favourable to his inspiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0561.mp3|it was like being in prison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0563.mp3|he could not tell whether the sun still shone on the earth or not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0564.mp3|the perspiration of the literary labour dropped from his brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0566.mp3|it was the liberation of his inner life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0567.mp3|the letting out of his soul into the wide world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0568.mp3|and the zeal of his guileless vanity first awakened by the offer of five hundred pounds from a publisher seemed something predestined and holy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0569.mp3|it would be of course most desirable to be informed exactly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0570.mp3|insisted the assistant commissioner uncandidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0571.mp3|chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0572.mp3|conscious of renewed irritation at this display of scrupulousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0574.mp3|and that a full report could be obtained in a few hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0575.mp3|a wire to the superintendent thus he spoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0576.mp3|rather slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0577.mp3|while his mind seemed already to be weighing the consequences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0578.mp3|a slight knitting of the brow was the outward sign of this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0579.mp3|but he was interrupted by a question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0582.mp3|he answered as if surprised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0583.mp3|the assistant commissioner uncrossed his legs suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0584.mp3|the briskness of that movement contrasted with the casual way in which he threw out a suggestion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0585.mp3|would you think that michaelis had anything to do with the preparation of that bomb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0587.mp3|the chief inspector assumed a reflective manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0588.mp3|i wouldn't say so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0589.mp3|there's no necessity to say anything at present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0590.mp3|he associates with men who are classed as dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0592.mp3|a sort of compliment i suppose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0593.mp3|and the chief inspector laughed a little angrily a little scornfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0594.mp3|with a man of that sort scrupulousness was a misplaced and even an illegal sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0595.mp3|the celebrity bestowed upon michaelis on his release two years ago by some emotional journalists in want of special copy had rankled ever since in his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0596.mp3|it was perfectly legal to arrest that man on the barest suspicion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0597.mp3|it was legal and expedient on the face of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0598.mp3|his two former chiefs would have seen the point at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0600.mp3|without saying either yes or no|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0602.mp3|as if lost in a dream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0603.mp3|moreover|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0604.mp3|besides being legal and expedient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0605.mp3|the arrest of michaelis solved a little personal difficulty which worried chief inspector heat somewhat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0606.mp3|this difficulty had its bearing upon his reputation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0607.mp3|upon his comfort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0608.mp3|and even upon the efficient performance of his duties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0610.mp3|if michaelis no doubt knew something about this outrage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0611.mp3|the chief inspector was fairly certain that he did not know too much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0612.mp3|this was just as well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0613.mp3|he knew much less the chief inspector was positive than certain other individuals he had in his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0614.mp3|but whose arrest seemed to him inexpedient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0615.mp3|besides being a more complicated matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0616.mp3|on account of the rules of the game|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0617.mp3|the rules of the game did not protect so much michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0618.mp3|who was an ex convict|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0619.mp3|it would be stupid not to take advantage of legal facilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0620.mp3|and the journalists who had written him up with emotional gush would be ready to write him down with emotional indignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0621.mp3|this prospect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0622.mp3|viewed with confidence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0623.mp3|had the attraction of a personal triumph for chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0624.mp3|and deep down in his blameless bosom of an average married citizen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0625.mp3|almost unconscious but potent nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0626.mp3|the dislike of being compelled by events to meddle with the desperate ferocity of the professor had its say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0627.mp3|this dislike had been strengthened by the chance meeting in the lane|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0628.mp3|the encounter did not leave behind with chief inspector heat that satisfactory sense of superiority the members of the police force get from the unofficial but intimate side of their intercourse with the criminal classes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0629.mp3|by which the vanity of power is soothed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0630.mp3|and the vulgar love of domination over our fellow creatures is flattered as worthily as it deserves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0632.mp3|he was impossible a mad dog to be left alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0633.mp3|not that the chief inspector was afraid of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0634.mp3|on the contrary he meant to have him some day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0635.mp3|but not yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0636.mp3|he meant to get hold of him in his own time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0637.mp3|properly and effectively according to the rules of the game|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0638.mp3|the present was not the right time for attempting that feat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0639.mp3|not the right time for many reasons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0640.mp3|personal and of public service|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0641.mp3|this being the strong feeling of inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0642.mp3|it appeared to him just and proper that this affair should be shunted off its obscure and inconvenient track|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0643.mp3|leading goodness knows where|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0644.mp3|into a quiet and lawful siding called michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0646.mp3|the bomb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0647.mp3|no i would not say that exactly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0648.mp3|we may never find that out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0649.mp3|but it's clear that he is connected with this in some way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0650.mp3|which we can find out without much trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0651.mp3|his countenance had that look of grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0652.mp3|overbearing indifference once well known and much dreaded by the better sort of thieves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0653.mp3|chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0654.mp3|though what is called a man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0655.mp3|was not a smiling animal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0656.mp3|but his inward state was that of satisfaction at the passively receptive attitude of the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0657.mp3|who murmured gently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0658.mp3|and you really think that the investigation should be made in that direction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0659.mp3|i do sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0660.mp3|quite convinced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0661.mp3|i am sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0662.mp3|that's the true line for us to take|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0663.mp3|the assistant commissioner withdrew the support of his hand from his reclining head with a suddenness that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0664.mp3|considering his languid attitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0665.mp3|seemed to menace his whole person with collapse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0667.mp3|on the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0669.mp3|extremely alert|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0670.mp3|behind the great writing table on which his hand had fallen with the sound of a sharp blow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0671.mp3|what i want to know is what put it out of your head till now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0672.mp3|put it out of my head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0673.mp3|repeated the chief inspector very slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0674.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0675.mp3|till you were called into this room you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0676.mp3|the chief inspector felt as if the air between his clothing and his skin had become unpleasantly hot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0677.mp3|it was the sensation of an unprecedented and incredible experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0679.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0680.mp3|exaggerating the deliberation of his utterance to the utmost limits of possibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0681.mp3|if there is a reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0682.mp3|of which i know nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0683.mp3|for not interfering with the convict michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0684.mp3|perhaps it's just as well i didn't start the county police after him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0685.mp3|this took such a long time to say that the unflagging attention of the assistant commissioner seemed a wonderful feat of endurance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0686.mp3|his retort came without delay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0687.mp3|no reason whatever that i know of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0690.mp3|this finessing with me is highly improper on your part highly improper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0691.mp3|and it's also unfair you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0692.mp3|you shouldn't leave me to puzzle things out for myself like this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0693.mp3|really i am surprised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0694.mp3|he paused then added smoothly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0695.mp3|i need scarcely tell you that this conversation is altogether unofficial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0696.mp3|these words were far from pacifying the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0698.mp3|in his pride of a trusted servant he was affected by the assurance that the rope was not shaken for the purpose of breaking his neck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0699.mp3|as by an exhibition of impudence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0700.mp3|as if anybody were afraid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0701.mp3|assistant commissioners come and go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0702.mp3|but a valuable chief inspector is not an ephemeral office phenomenon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0703.mp3|he was not afraid of getting a broken neck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0704.mp3|to have his performance spoiled was more than enough to account for the glow of honest indignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0706.mp3|the thought of chief inspector heat took a threatening and prophetic shape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0707.mp3|you my boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0708.mp3|he said to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0709.mp3|keeping his round and habitually roving eyes fastened upon the assistant commissioner's face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0712.mp3|you don't know your place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0713.mp3|and your place won't know you very long either|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0715.mp3|as if in provoking answer to that thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0716.mp3|something like the ghost of an amiable smile passed on the lips of the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0717.mp3|his manner was easy and business like while he persisted in administering another shake to the tight rope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0718.mp3|let us come now to what you have discovered on the spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0719.mp3|chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0720.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0721.mp3|a fool and his job are soon parted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0722.mp3|went on the train of prophetic thought in chief inspector heat's head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0724.mp3|even when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0725.mp3|fired out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0726.mp3|this was the precise image|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0728.mp3|without softening very much the basilisk nature of his stare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0729.mp3|he said impassively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0730.mp3|we are coming to that part of my investigation sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0731.mp3|that's right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0733.mp3|the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0734.mp3|who had made up his mind to jump off the rope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0735.mp3|came to the ground with gloomy frankness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0736.mp3|i've brought away an address|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0737.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0738.mp3|pulling out of his pocket without haste a singed rag of dark blue cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0741.mp3|the overcoat may not have been his|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0742.mp3|and may even have been stolen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0743.mp3|but that's not at all probable if you look at this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0744.mp3|the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0745.mp3|stepping up to the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0746.mp3|smoothed out carefully the rag of blue cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0747.mp3|he had picked it up from the repulsive heap in the mortuary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0748.mp3|because a tailor's name is found sometimes under the collar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0749.mp3|it is not often of much use|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0750.mp3|but still he only half expected to find anything useful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0751.mp3|but certainly he did not expect to find not under the collar at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0753.mp3|the chief inspector removed his smoothing hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0754.mp3|i carried it off with me without anybody taking notice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0755.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0756.mp3|i thought it best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0757.mp3|it can always be produced if required|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0758.mp3|the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0759.mp3|rising a little in his chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0761.mp3|he sat looking at it in silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0762.mp3|only the number thirty two and the name of brett street were written in marking ink on a piece of calico slightly larger than an ordinary cigarette paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0763.mp3|he was genuinely surprised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0764.mp3|can't understand why he should have gone about labelled like this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0765.mp3|he said looking up at chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0766.mp3|it's a most extraordinary thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0768.mp3|said the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0769.mp3|he professed to be eighty four years old but he didn't look his age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0770.mp3|he told me he was also afraid of losing his memory suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0771.mp3|like those people he has been reading of in the papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0772.mp3|a question from the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0774.mp3|interrupted that reminiscence abruptly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0775.mp3|the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0776.mp3|driven down to the ground by unfair artifices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0777.mp3|had elected to walk the path of unreserved openness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0778.mp3|if he believed firmly that to know too much was not good for the department|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0779.mp3|the judicious holding back of knowledge was as far as his loyalty dared to go for the good of the service|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0784.mp3|so he answered concisely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0785.mp3|it's a shop sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0786.mp3|the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0787.mp3|with his eyes lowered on the rag of blue cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0788.mp3|waited for more information|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0789.mp3|as that did not come he proceeded to obtain it by a series of questions propounded with gentle patience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0790.mp3|thus he acquired an idea of the nature of mister verloc's commerce|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0791.mp3|of his personal appearance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0792.mp3|and heard at last his name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0793.mp3|in a pause the assistant commissioner raised his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0794.mp3|and discovered some animation on the chief inspector's face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0795.mp3|they looked at each other in silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0796.mp3|of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0797.mp3|said the latter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0798.mp3|the department has no record of that man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0799.mp3|did any of my predecessors have any knowledge of what you have told me now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0800.mp3|asked the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0801.mp3|putting his elbows on the table and raising his joined hands before his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0802.mp3|as if about to offer prayer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0803.mp3|only that his eyes had not a pious expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0804.mp3|no sir certainly not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0805.mp3|what would have been the object|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0806.mp3|that sort of man could never be produced publicly to any good purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0807.mp3|it was sufficient for me to know who he was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0808.mp3|and to make use of him in a way that could be used publicly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0809.mp3|and do you think that sort of private knowledge consistent with the official position you occupy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0811.mp3|i think it's quite proper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0815.mp3|it's a private affair of my own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0816.mp3|a personal friend of mine in the french police gave me the hint that the fellow was an embassy spy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0817.mp3|private friendship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0818.mp3|private information|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0819.mp3|private use of it that's how i look upon it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0820.mp3|the assistant commissioner after remarking to himself that the mental state of the renowned chief inspector seemed to affect the outline of his lower jaw|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0821.mp3|as if the lively sense of his high professional distinction had been located in that part of his anatomy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0822.mp3|dismissed the point for the moment with a calm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0823.mp3|i see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0824.mp3|then leaning his cheek on his joined hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0826.mp3|to this inquiry the private answer of the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0827.mp3|so private that it was never shaped into audible words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0828.mp3|was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0829.mp3|long before you were even thought of for your place here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0831.mp3|i saw him for the first time in my life a little more than seven years ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0832.mp3|when two imperial highnesses and the imperial chancellor were on a visit here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0833.mp3|i was put in charge of all the arrangements for looking after them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0836.mp3|one evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0837.mp3|three days before the guildhall banquet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0838.mp3|he sent word that he wanted to see me for a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0839.mp3|i was downstairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0840.mp3|and the carriages were at the door to take the imperial highnesses and the chancellor to the opera|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0841.mp3|i went up at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0842.mp3|i found the baron walking up and down his bedroom in a pitiable state of distress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0843.mp3|squeezing his hands together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0844.mp3|he assured me he had the fullest confidence in our police and in my abilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0846.mp3|he wanted me to hear what that man had to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0847.mp3|he took me at once into a dressing room next door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0848.mp3|where i saw a big fellow in a heavy overcoat sitting all alone on a chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0849.mp3|and holding his hat and stick in one hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0852.mp3|i talked with him for some five minutes perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0853.mp3|he certainly gave me a piece of very startling news|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0854.mp3|then the baron took me aside nervously to praise him up to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0855.mp3|and when i turned round again i discovered that the fellow had vanished like a ghost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0857.mp3|there was no time to run after him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0858.mp3|as i had to hurry off after the ambassador down the great staircase|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0859.mp3|and see the party started safe for the opera|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0860.mp3|however i acted upon the information that very night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0861.mp3|whether it was perfectly correct or not it did look serious enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0862.mp3|very likely it saved us from an ugly trouble on the day of the imperial visit to the city|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0865.mp3|my attention was attracted to a big burly man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0866.mp3|i thought i had seen somewhere before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0868.mp3|i went after him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0869.mp3|as it was on my way towards charing cross|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0870.mp3|and there seeing one of our detectives across the road|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0871.mp3|i beckoned him over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0872.mp3|and pointed out the fellow to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0873.mp3|with instructions to watch his movements for a couple of days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0874.mp3|and then report to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0877.mp3|our man had seen the luggage being put on the cab|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0878.mp3|there were some old paris labels on one of the bags|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0879.mp3|somehow i couldn't get the fellow out of my head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0880.mp3|and the very next time i had to go to paris on service i spoke about him to that friend of mine in the paris police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0881.mp3|my friend said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0883.mp3|he says he is an englishman by birth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0884.mp3|we have an idea that he has been for a good few years now a secret agent of one of the foreign embassies in london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0888.mp3|the fellow was a secret agent to my certain knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0890.mp3|i thought i had better know all there was to know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0891.mp3|but i don't suppose you want to hear his history now sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0893.mp3|the history of your relations with that useful personage is the only thing that matters just now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0894.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0895.mp3|closing slowly his weary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0896.mp3|deep set eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0897.mp3|and then opening them swiftly with a greatly refreshed glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0898.mp3|there's nothing official about them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0899.mp3|said the chief inspector bitterly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0900.mp3|i went into his shop one evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0901.mp3|told him who i was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0902.mp3|and reminded him of our first meeting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0904.mp3|he said that he was married and settled now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0905.mp3|and that all he wanted was not to be interfered in his little business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0907.mp3|as long as he didn't go in for anything obviously outrageous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0908.mp3|he would be left alone by the police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0909.mp3|that was worth something to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0910.mp3|because a word from us to the custom house people would have been enough to get some of these packages he gets from paris and brussels opened in dover|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0911.mp3|with confiscation to follow for certain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0912.mp3|and perhaps a prosecution as well at the end of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0913.mp3|that's a very precarious trade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0914.mp3|murmured the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0915.mp3|why did he go in for that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0916.mp3|the chief inspector raised scornful eyebrows dispassionately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0917.mp3|most likely got a connection friends on the continent amongst people who deal in such wares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0918.mp3|they would be just the sort he would consort with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0919.mp3|he's a lazy dog too like the rest of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0920.mp3|what do you get from him in exchange for your protection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0922.mp3|he would not be much good to anybody but myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0924.mp3|i can understand the sort of hint he can give|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0925.mp3|and when i want a hint he can generally furnish it to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0926.mp3|the chief inspector lost himself suddenly in a discreet reflective mood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0927.mp3|and the assistant commissioner repressed a smile at the fleeting thought that the reputation of chief inspector heat might possibly have been made in a great part by the secret agent verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0928.mp3|in a more general way of being of use|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0930.mp3|he meets the new arrivals frequently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0931.mp3|and afterwards keeps track of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0932.mp3|he seems to have been told off for that sort of duty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0933.mp3|when i want an address in a hurry i can always get it from him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0934.mp3|of course i know how to manage our relations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0935.mp3|i haven't seen him to speak to three times in the last two years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0938.mp3|and he answers me in the same way at my private address|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0939.mp3|from time to time the assistant commissioner gave an almost imperceptible nod|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0940.mp3|the chief inspector added that he did not suppose mister verloc to be deep in the confidence of the prominent members of the revolutionary international council|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0941.mp3|but that he was generally trusted of that there could be no doubt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0943.mp3|he concluded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0944.mp3|i've always found he could tell me something worth knowing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0945.mp3|the assistant commissioner made a significant remark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0946.mp3|he failed you this time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0947.mp3|neither had i wind of anything in any other way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0948.mp3|retorted chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0949.mp3|i asked him nothing so he could tell me nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0950.mp3|he isn't one of our men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0951.mp3|it isn't as if he were in our pay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0953.mp3|muttered the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0954.mp3|he's a spy in the pay of a foreign government|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0955.mp3|we could never confess to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0956.mp3|i must do my work in my own way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0957.mp3|declared the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0960.mp3|there are things not fit for everybody to know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0961.mp3|your idea of secrecy seems to consist in keeping the chief of your department in the dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0962.mp3|that's stretching it perhaps a little too far isn't it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0963.mp3|he lives over his shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0965.mp3|oh yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0966.mp3|he lives over his shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0967.mp3|the wife's mother i fancy lives with them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0968.mp3|is the house watched|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0970.mp3|it wouldn't do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0971.mp3|certain people who come there are watched|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0972.mp3|my opinion is that he knows nothing of this affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0973.mp3|how do you account for this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0974.mp3|the assistant commissioner nodded at the cloth rag lying before him on the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0975.mp3|i don't account for it at all sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0976.mp3|it's simply unaccountable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0977.mp3|it can't be explained by what i know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0978.mp3|the chief inspector made those admissions with the frankness of a man whose reputation is established as if on a rock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0979.mp3|at any rate not at this present moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0980.mp3|i think that the man who had most to do with it will turn out to be michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0981.mp3|you do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0982.mp3|yes sir because i can answer for all the others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0983.mp3|what about that other man supposed to have escaped from the park|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0984.mp3|i should think he's far away by this time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0986.mp3|the assistant commissioner looked hard at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0987.mp3|and rose suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0988.mp3|as though having made up his mind to some course of action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0989.mp3|as a matter of fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0990.mp3|he had that very moment succumbed to a fascinating temptation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0991.mp3|the chief inspector heard himself dismissed with instructions to meet his superior early next morning for further consultation upon the case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0992.mp3|he listened with an impenetrable face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0993.mp3|and walked out of the room with measured steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0994.mp3|whatever might have been the plans of the assistant commissioner they had nothing to do with that desk work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0995.mp3|which was the bane of his existence because of its confined nature and apparent lack of reality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0996.mp3|it could not have had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0997.mp3|or else the general air of alacrity that came upon the assistant commissioner would have been inexplicable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0998.mp3|as soon as he was left alone he looked for his hat impulsively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_0999.mp3|and put it on his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_1000.mp3|having done that he sat down again to reconsider the whole matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_1001.mp3|but as his mind was already made up this did not take long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_1002.mp3|and before chief inspector heat had gone very far on the way home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_06_conrad_1003.mp3|he also left the building|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0002.mp3|then crossing a very broad thoroughfare entered a public edifice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0003.mp3|and sought speech with a young private secretary unpaid of a great personage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0005.mp3|smooth faced young man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0006.mp3|whose symmetrically arranged hair gave him the air of a large and neat schoolboy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0007.mp3|met the assistant commissioner's request with a doubtful look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0008.mp3|and spoke with bated breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0009.mp3|would he see you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0010.mp3|i don't know about that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0011.mp3|he has walked over from the house an hour ago to talk with the permanent under secretary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0012.mp3|and now he's ready to walk back again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0013.mp3|he might have sent for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0014.mp3|but he does it for the sake of a little exercise i suppose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0015.mp3|it's all the exercise he can find time for while this session lasts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0016.mp3|i don't complain i rather enjoy these little strolls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0017.mp3|he leans on my arm and doesn't open his lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0020.mp3|he's very tired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0021.mp3|and well not in the sweetest of tempers just now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0022.mp3|it's in connection with that greenwich affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0026.mp3|but i will go and see if you insist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0027.mp3|do that's a good fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0028.mp3|said the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0030.mp3|composing for himself an innocent face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0031.mp3|he opened a door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0032.mp3|and went in with the assurance of a nice and privileged child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0033.mp3|and presently he reappeared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0034.mp3|with a nod to the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0035.mp3|who passing through the same door left open for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0037.mp3|vast in bulk and stature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0038.mp3|with a long white face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0039.mp3|which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0040.mp3|broadened at the base by a big double chin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0042.mp3|the great personage seemed an expanding man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0043.mp3|unfortunate from a tailoring point of view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0044.mp3|the cross folds in the middle of a buttoned black coat added to the impression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0045.mp3|as if the fastenings of the garment were tried to the utmost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0046.mp3|from the head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0047.mp3|set upward on a thick neck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0048.mp3|the eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0049.mp3|with puffy lower lids|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0050.mp3|stared with a haughty droop on each side of a hooked aggressive nose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0051.mp3|nobly salient in the vast pale circumference of the face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0052.mp3|a shiny silk hat and a pair of worn gloves lying ready on the end of a long table looked expanded too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0056.mp3|and uttered no word of greeting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0057.mp3|i would like to know if this is the beginning of another dynamite campaign|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0058.mp3|he asked at once in a deep very smooth voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0059.mp3|don't go into details|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0060.mp3|i have no time for that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0061.mp3|the assistant commissioner's figure before this big and rustic presence had the frail slenderness of a reed addressing an oak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0062.mp3|and indeed the unbroken record of that man's descent surpassed in the number of centuries the age of the oldest oak in the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0063.mp3|no as far as one can be positive about anything i can assure you that it is not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0066.mp3|said the great man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0068.mp3|seems to consist mainly in making the secretary of state look a fool|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0069.mp3|i have been told positively in this very room less than a month ago that nothing of the sort was even possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0070.mp3|the assistant commissioner glanced in the direction of the window calmly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0071.mp3|you will allow me to remark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0073.mp3|that so far i have had no opportunity to give you assurances of any kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0076.mp3|confessed the deep smooth voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0077.mp3|i sent for heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0079.mp3|and how are you getting on over there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0080.mp3|i believe i am learning something every day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0081.mp3|of course of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0082.mp3|i hope you will get on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0083.mp3|thank you sir ethelred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0084.mp3|i've learned something to day and even within the last hour or so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0085.mp3|there is much in this affair of a kind that does not meet the eye in a usual anarchist outrage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0086.mp3|even if one looked into it as deep as can be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0088.mp3|the great man put his arms akimbo|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0089.mp3|the backs of his big hands resting on his hips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0090.mp3|very well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0091.mp3|go on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0092.mp3|only no details pray|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0093.mp3|spare me the details|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0094.mp3|you shall not be troubled with them sir ethelred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0095.mp3|the assistant commissioner began with a calm and untroubled assurance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0096.mp3|while he was speaking the hands on the face of the clock behind the great man's back a heavy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0100.mp3|he spoke with a studious fidelity to a parenthetical manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0101.mp3|into which every little fact that is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0102.mp3|every detail fitted with delightful ease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0103.mp3|not a murmur nor even a movement hinted at interruption|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0104.mp3|the great personage might have been the statue of one of his own princely ancestors stripped of a crusader's war harness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0106.mp3|the assistant commissioner felt as though he were at liberty to talk for an hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0107.mp3|but he kept his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0108.mp3|and at the end of the time mentioned above he broke off with a sudden conclusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0110.mp3|reproducing the opening statement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0112.mp3|the kind of thing which meets us under the surface of this affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0113.mp3|otherwise without gravity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0114.mp3|is unusual in this precise form at least and requires special treatment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0115.mp3|the tone of sir ethelred was deepened full of conviction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0116.mp3|i should think so involving the ambassador of a foreign power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0117.mp3|oh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0118.mp3|the ambassador|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0119.mp3|protested the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0120.mp3|erect and slender|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0121.mp3|allowing himself a mere half smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0122.mp3|it would be stupid of me to advance anything of the kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0123.mp3|and it is absolutely unnecessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0124.mp3|because if i am right in my surmises|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0127.mp3|like a cavern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0128.mp3|into which the hooked nose seemed anxious to peer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0129.mp3|there came from it a subdued rolling sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0130.mp3|as from a distant organ with the scornful indignation stop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0132.mp3|these people are too impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0134.mp3|a turk would have more decency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0137.mp3|that strictly speaking we know nothing positively as yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0139.mp3|but how would you define it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0141.mp3|barefaced audacity amounting to childishness of a peculiar sort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0142.mp3|we can't put up with the innocence of nasty little children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0143.mp3|said the great and expanded personage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0144.mp3|expanding a little more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0146.mp3|the haughty drooping glance struck crushingly the carpet at the assistant commissioner's feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0147.mp3|they'll have to get a hard rap on the knuckles over this affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0148.mp3|we must be in a position to what is your general idea stated shortly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0149.mp3|no need to go into details|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0150.mp3|no sir ethelred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0154.mp3|that the spy will fabricate his information is a mere commonplace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0155.mp3|but in the sphere of political and revolutionary action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0156.mp3|relying partly on violence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0157.mp3|the professional spy has every facility to fabricate the very facts themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0158.mp3|and will spread the double evil of emulation in one direction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0159.mp3|and of panic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0160.mp3|hasty legislation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0163.mp3|however this is an imperfect world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0166.mp3|with big elbows stuck out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0167.mp3|said hastily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0168.mp3|be lucid please|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0169.mp3|yes sir ethelred an imperfect world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0170.mp3|therefore directly the character of this affair suggested itself to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0171.mp3|i thought it should be dealt with with special secrecy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0172.mp3|and ventured to come over here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0173.mp3|that's right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0174.mp3|approved the great personage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0175.mp3|glancing down complacently over his double chin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0176.mp3|i am glad there's somebody over at your shop who thinks that the secretary of state may be trusted now and then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0177.mp3|the assistant commissioner had an amused smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0178.mp3|i was really thinking that it might be better at this stage for heat to be replaced by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0180.mp3|heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0181.mp3|an ass eh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0182.mp3|exclaimed the great man with distinct animosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0183.mp3|not at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0184.mp3|pray sir ethelred don't put that unjust interpretation on my remarks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0186.mp3|too clever by half|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0187.mp3|neither at least not as a rule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0188.mp3|all the grounds of my surmises i have from him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0189.mp3|the only thing i've discovered by myself is that he has been making use of that man privately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0190.mp3|who could blame him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0191.mp3|he's an old police hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0192.mp3|he told me virtually that he must have tools to work with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0193.mp3|it occurred to me that this tool should be surrendered to the special crimes division as a whole|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0194.mp3|instead of remaining the private property of chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0195.mp3|i extend my conception of our departmental duties to the suppression of the secret agent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0196.mp3|but chief inspector heat is an old departmental hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0197.mp3|he would accuse me of perverting its morality and attacking its efficiency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0198.mp3|he would define it bitterly as protection extended to the criminal class of revolutionists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0199.mp3|it would mean just that to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0201.mp3|but what do you mean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0203.mp3|first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0204.mp3|that there's but poor comfort in being able to declare that any given act of violence damaging property or destroying life is not the work of anarchism at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0206.mp3|this i fancy is much more frequent than we suppose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0208.mp3|it's obvious that the existence of these people in the pay of foreign governments destroys in a measure the efficiency of our supervision|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0209.mp3|a spy of that sort can afford to be more reckless than the most reckless of conspirators|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0210.mp3|his occupation is free from all restraint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0211.mp3|he's without as much faith as is necessary for complete negation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0214.mp3|the existence of these spies amongst the revolutionary groups|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0215.mp3|which we are reproached for harbouring here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0216.mp3|does away with all certitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0217.mp3|you have received a reassuring statement from chief inspector heat some time ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0218.mp3|it was by no means groundless and yet this episode happens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0219.mp3|i call it an episode|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0220.mp3|because this affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0221.mp3|i make bold to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0222.mp3|is episodic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0223.mp3|it is no part of any general scheme however wild|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0224.mp3|the very peculiarities which surprise and perplex chief inspector heat establish its character in my eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0225.mp3|i am keeping clear of details sir ethelred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0226.mp3|the personage on the hearthrug had been listening with profound attention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0228.mp3|be as concise as you can|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0229.mp3|the assistant commissioner intimated by an earnest deferential gesture that he was anxious to be concise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0230.mp3|there is a peculiar stupidity and feebleness in the conduct of this affair which gives me excellent hopes of getting behind it and finding there something else than an individual freak of fanaticism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0231.mp3|for it is a planned thing undoubtedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0232.mp3|the actual perpetrator seems to have been led by the hand to the spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0233.mp3|and then abandoned hurriedly to his own devices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0234.mp3|the inference is that he was imported from abroad for the purpose of committing this outrage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0236.mp3|unless one were to accept the fantastic theory that he was a deaf mute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0237.mp3|i wonder now but this is idle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0238.mp3|he has destroyed himself by an accident obviously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0239.mp3|not an extraordinary accident|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0240.mp3|but an extraordinary little fact remains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0241.mp3|the address on his clothing discovered by the merest accident too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0242.mp3|it is an incredible little fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0243.mp3|so incredible that the explanation which will account for it is bound to touch the bottom of this affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0244.mp3|instead of instructing heat to go on with this case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0246.mp3|i mean where it may be picked up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0247.mp3|that is in a certain shop in brett street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0250.mp3|the assistant commissioner paused then added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0252.mp3|in order to raise his drooping glance to the speaker's face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0253.mp3|the personage on the hearthrug had gradually tilted his head farther back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0254.mp3|which gave him an aspect of extraordinary haughtiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0255.mp3|why not leave it to heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0256.mp3|because he is an old departmental hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0257.mp3|they have their own morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0258.mp3|my line of inquiry would appear to him an awful perversion of duty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0261.mp3|i am trying to be as lucid as i can in presenting this obscure matter to you without details|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0262.mp3|he would would he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0263.mp3|muttered the proud head of sir ethelred from its lofty elevation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0264.mp3|i am afraid so with an indignation and disgust of which you or i can have no idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0265.mp3|he's an excellent servant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0266.mp3|we must not put an undue strain on his loyalty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0267.mp3|that's always a mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0270.mp3|i haven't the slightest wish to spare this man verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0271.mp3|he will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0273.mp3|be extremely startled to find his connection with this affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0274.mp3|whatever it may be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0275.mp3|brought home to him so quickly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0276.mp3|frightening him will not be very difficult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0277.mp3|but our true objective lies behind him somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0278.mp3|i want your authority to give him such assurances of personal safety as i may think proper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0280.mp3|said the personage on the hearthrug|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0281.mp3|find out as much as you can find it out in your own way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0282.mp3|i must set about it without loss of time this very evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0283.mp3|said the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0284.mp3|sir ethelred shifted one hand under his coat tails|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0285.mp3|and tilting back his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0286.mp3|looked at him steadily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0287.mp3|we'll have a late sitting to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0288.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0289.mp3|come to the house with your discoveries if we are not gone home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0290.mp3|i'll warn toodles to look out for you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0291.mp3|he'll take you into my room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0292.mp3|the numerous family and the wide connections of the youthful looking private secretary cherished for him the hope of an austere and exalted destiny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0293.mp3|meantime the social sphere he adorned in his hours of idleness chose to pet him under the above nickname|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0294.mp3|and sir ethelred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0295.mp3|hearing it on the lips of his wife and girls every day mostly at breakfast time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0296.mp3|had conferred upon it the dignity of unsmiling adoption|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0297.mp3|the assistant commissioner was surprised and gratified extremely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0298.mp3|i shall certainly bring my discoveries to the house on the chance of you having the time to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0299.mp3|i won't have the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0300.mp3|interrupted the great personage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0301.mp3|but i will see you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0302.mp3|i haven't the time now and you are going yourself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0303.mp3|yes sir ethelred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0304.mp3|i think it the best way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0305.mp3|the personage had tilted his head so far back that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0306.mp3|in order to keep the assistant commissioner under his observation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0307.mp3|he had to nearly close his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0310.mp3|and how do you propose will you assume a disguise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0311.mp3|hardly a disguise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0312.mp3|i'll change my clothes of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0314.mp3|repeated the great man with a sort of absent minded loftiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0315.mp3|he turned his big head slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0317.mp3|feeble tick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0318.mp3|the gilt hands had taken the opportunity to steal through no less than five and twenty minutes behind his back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0319.mp3|the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0320.mp3|who could not see them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0321.mp3|grew a little nervous in the interval|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0322.mp3|but the great man presented to him a calm and undismayed face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0323.mp3|very well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0324.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0327.mp3|but what first put you in motion in this direction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0329.mp3|began the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0330.mp3|ah yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0331.mp3|opinion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0332.mp3|that's of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0333.mp3|but the immediate motive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0334.mp3|what shall i say sir ethelred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0335.mp3|a new man's antagonism to old methods|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0336.mp3|a desire to know something at first hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0337.mp3|some impatience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0338.mp3|it's my old work but the harness is different|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0339.mp3|it has been chafing me a little in one or two tender places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0340.mp3|i hope you'll get on over there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0341.mp3|said the great man kindly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0342.mp3|extending his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0343.mp3|soft to the touch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0344.mp3|but broad and powerful like the hand of a glorified farmer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0345.mp3|the assistant commissioner shook it and withdrew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0346.mp3|in the outer room toodles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0347.mp3|who had been waiting perched on the edge of a table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0348.mp3|advanced to meet him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0349.mp3|subduing his natural buoyancy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0351.mp3|satisfactory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0352.mp3|he asked with airy importance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0353.mp3|perfectly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0354.mp3|you've earned my undying gratitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0355.mp3|answered the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0356.mp3|whose long face looked wooden in contrast with the peculiar character of the other's gravity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0357.mp3|which seemed perpetually ready to break into ripples and chuckles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0358.mp3|that's all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0359.mp3|but seriously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0362.mp3|of course it is a revolutionary measure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0363.mp3|but these fellows have no decency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0364.mp3|the personal attacks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0365.mp3|i read the papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0366.mp3|remarked the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0369.mp3|and you have no notion what a mass of work he has got to get through every day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0370.mp3|he does it all himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0371.mp3|seems unable to trust anyone with these fisheries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0372.mp3|and yet he's given a whole half hour to the consideration of my very small sprat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0373.mp3|interjected the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0375.mp3|is it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0376.mp3|i'm glad to hear that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0377.mp3|but it's a pity you didn't keep away then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0378.mp3|this fight takes it out of him frightfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0379.mp3|the man's getting exhausted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0380.mp3|i feel it by the way he leans on my arm as we walk over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0381.mp3|and i say is he safe in the streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0382.mp3|mullins has been marching his men up here this afternoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0386.mp3|i say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0387.mp3|these foreign scoundrels aren't likely to throw something at him are they|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0388.mp3|it would be a national calamity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0389.mp3|the country can't spare him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0390.mp3|not to mention yourself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0391.mp3|he leans on your arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0392.mp3|suggested the assistant commissioner soberly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0393.mp3|you would both go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0394.mp3|it would be an easy way for a young man to go down into history|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0395.mp3|not so many british ministers have been assassinated as to make it a minor incident|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0396.mp3|but seriously now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0397.mp3|i am afraid that if you want to go down into history you'll have to do something for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0398.mp3|seriously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0399.mp3|there's no danger whatever for both of you but from overwork|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0401.mp3|the fisheries won't kill me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0402.mp3|i am used to late hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0403.mp3|he declared with ingenuous levity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0405.mp3|feeling an instant compunction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0406.mp3|he began to assume an air of statesman like moodiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0407.mp3|as one draws on a glove|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0408.mp3|his massive intellect will stand any amount of work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0411.mp3|with that abusive brute cheeseman at their head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0412.mp3|insult him every night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0414.mp3|murmured the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0415.mp3|the time has come and he is the only man great enough for the work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0416.mp3|protested the revolutionary toodles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0418.mp3|speculative gaze of the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0419.mp3|somewhere in a corridor a distant bell tinkled urgently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0420.mp3|and with devoted vigilance the young man pricked up his ears at the sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0421.mp3|he's ready to go now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0422.mp3|he exclaimed in a whisper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0423.mp3|snatched up his hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0424.mp3|and vanished from the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0425.mp3|the assistant commissioner went out by another door in a less elastic manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0426.mp3|again he crossed the wide thoroughfare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0427.mp3|walked along a narrow street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0429.mp3|he kept up this accelerated pace to the door of his private room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0431.mp3|he stood still for a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0432.mp3|then walked up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0433.mp3|looked all round on the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0434.mp3|sat down in his chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0437.mp3|chief inspector heat gone yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0438.mp3|yes sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0439.mp3|went away half an hour ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0442.mp3|and sitting still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0443.mp3|with his hat pushed off his forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0444.mp3|he thought that it was just like heat's confounded cheek to carry off quietly the only piece of material evidence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0445.mp3|but he thought this without animosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0446.mp3|old and valued servants will take liberties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0448.mp3|dismissing from his mind this manifestation of chief inspector heat's mistrust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0449.mp3|he wrote and despatched a note to his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0451.mp3|with whom they were engaged to dine that evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0454.mp3|a row of wooden pegs and a shelf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0455.mp3|brought out wonderfully the length of his grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0457.mp3|he stepped back into the full light of the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0459.mp3|reflective don quixote|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0460.mp3|with the sunken eyes of a dark enthusiast and a very deliberate manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0461.mp3|he left the scene of his daily labours quickly like an unobtrusive shadow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0462.mp3|his descent into the street was like the descent into a slimy aquarium from which the water had been run off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0464.mp3|the walls of the houses were wet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0465.mp3|the mud of the roadway glistened with an effect of phosphorescence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0466.mp3|and when he emerged into the strand out of a narrow street by the side of charing cross station the genius of the locality assimilated him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0467.mp3|he might have been but one more of the queer foreign fish that can be seen of an evening about there flitting round the dark corners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0468.mp3|he came to a stand on the very edge of the pavement and waited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0469.mp3|his exercised eyes had made out in the confused movements of lights and shadows thronging the roadway the crawling approach of a hansom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0470.mp3|he gave no sign|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0471.mp3|but when the low step gliding along the curbstone came to his feet he dodged in skilfully in front of the big turning wheel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0473.mp3|it was not a long drive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0474.mp3|it ended by signal abruptly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0475.mp3|nowhere in particular|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0476.mp3|between two lamp posts before a large drapery establishment a long range of shops already lapped up in sheets of corrugated iron for the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0477.mp3|tendering a coin through the trap door the fare slipped out and away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0478.mp3|leaving an effect of uncanny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0479.mp3|eccentric ghastliness upon the driver's mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0480.mp3|but the size of the coin was satisfactory to his touch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0481.mp3|and his education not being literary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0482.mp3|he remained untroubled by the fear of finding it presently turned to a dead leaf in his pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0484.mp3|he contemplated their actions with a limited interest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0485.mp3|the sharp pulling of his horse right round expressed his philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0486.mp3|meantime the assistant commissioner was already giving his order to a waiter in a little italian restaurant round the corner one of those traps for the hungry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0487.mp3|long and narrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0488.mp3|baited with a perspective of mirrors and white napery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0490.mp3|but with an atmosphere of their own an atmosphere of fraudulent cookery mocking an abject mankind in the most pressing of its miserable necessities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0491.mp3|in this immoral atmosphere the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0492.mp3|reflecting upon his enterprise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0493.mp3|seemed to lose some more of his identity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0494.mp3|he had a sense of loneliness of evil freedom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0495.mp3|it was rather pleasant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0496.mp3|when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0497.mp3|after paying for his short meal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0498.mp3|he stood up and waited for his change|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0499.mp3|he saw himself in the sheet of glass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0500.mp3|and was struck by his foreign appearance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0501.mp3|he contemplated his own image with a melancholy and inquisitive gaze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0502.mp3|then by sudden inspiration raised the collar of his jacket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0503.mp3|this arrangement appeared to him commendable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0504.mp3|and he completed it by giving an upward twist to the ends of his black moustache|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0505.mp3|he was satisfied by the subtle modification of his personal aspect caused by these small changes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0506.mp3|that'll do very well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0507.mp3|he thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0508.mp3|i'll get a little wet a little splashed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0509.mp3|he became aware of the waiter at his elbow and of a small pile of silver coins on the edge of the table before him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0510.mp3|the waiter kept one eye on it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0511.mp3|while his other eye followed the long back of a tall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0512.mp3|not very young girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0513.mp3|who passed up to a distant table looking perfectly sightless and altogether unapproachable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0514.mp3|she seemed to be a habitual customer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0515.mp3|on going out the assistant commissioner made to himself the observation that the patrons of the place had lost in the frequentation of fraudulent cookery all their national and private characteristics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0516.mp3|and this was strange|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0517.mp3|since the italian restaurant is such a peculiarly british institution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0519.mp3|neither was their personality stamped in any way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0520.mp3|professionally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0521.mp3|socially or racially|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0522.mp3|they seemed created for the italian restaurant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0523.mp3|unless the italian restaurant had been perchance created for them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0524.mp3|but that last hypothesis was unthinkable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0525.mp3|since one could not place them anywhere outside those special establishments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0526.mp3|one never met these enigmatical persons elsewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0527.mp3|it was impossible to form a precise idea what occupations they followed by day and where they went to bed at night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0528.mp3|and he himself had become unplaced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0529.mp3|it would have been impossible for anybody to guess his occupation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0530.mp3|as to going to bed there was a doubt even in his own mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0531.mp3|not indeed in regard to his domicile itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0532.mp3|but very much so in respect of the time when he would be able to return there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0534.mp3|he advanced at once into an immensity of greasy slime and damp plaster interspersed with lamps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0535.mp3|and enveloped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0537.mp3|penetrated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0539.mp3|and suffocated by the blackness of a wet london night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0540.mp3|which is composed of soot and drops of water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0541.mp3|brett street was not very far away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0542.mp3|it branched off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0544.mp3|from the side of an open triangular space surrounded by dark and mysterious houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0545.mp3|temples of petty commerce emptied of traders for the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0547.mp3|beyond all was black|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0548.mp3|and the few people passing in that direction vanished at one stride beyond the glowing heaps of oranges and lemons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0549.mp3|no footsteps echoed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0550.mp3|they would never be heard of again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0551.mp3|the adventurous head of the special crimes department watched these disappearances from a distance with an interested eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0552.mp3|he felt light hearted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0553.mp3|as though he had been ambushed all alone in a jungle many thousands of miles away from departmental desks and official inkstands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0554.mp3|this joyousness and dispersion of thought before a task of some importance seems to prove that this world of ours is not such a very serious affair after all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0555.mp3|for the assistant commissioner was not constitutionally inclined to levity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0556.mp3|the policeman on the beat projected his sombre and moving form against the luminous glory of oranges and lemons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0557.mp3|and entered brett street without haste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0558.mp3|the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0559.mp3|as though he were a member of the criminal classes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0560.mp3|lingered out of sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0561.mp3|awaiting his return|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0562.mp3|but this constable seemed to be lost for ever to the force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0563.mp3|he never returned must have gone out at the other end of brett street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0564.mp3|the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0565.mp3|reaching this conclusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0566.mp3|entered the street in his turn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0568.mp3|the man was refreshing himself inside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0569.mp3|and the horses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0570.mp3|their big heads lowered to the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0571.mp3|fed out of nose bags steadily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0573.mp3|on the opposite side of the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0574.mp3|another suspect patch of dim light issued from mister verloc's shop front|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0575.mp3|hung with papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0576.mp3|heaving with vague piles of cardboard boxes and the shapes of books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0577.mp3|the assistant commissioner stood observing it across the roadway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0578.mp3|there could be no mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0579.mp3|by the side of the front window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0580.mp3|encumbered by the shadows of nondescript things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0581.mp3|the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0582.mp3|standing ajar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0584.mp3|clear streak of gas light within|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0585.mp3|behind the assistant commissioner the van and horses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0586.mp3|merged into one mass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0587.mp3|seemed something alive a square backed black monster blocking half the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0588.mp3|with sudden iron shod stampings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0592.mp3|the harshly festive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0594.mp3|this barrier of blazing lights|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0596.mp3|seemed to drive the obscurity of the street back upon itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0597.mp3|make it more sullen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_07_conrad_0599.mp3|and sinister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0003.mp3|conceived in the astuteness of her uneasy heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0004.mp3|the old woman had pursued with secrecy and determination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0005.mp3|that was the time when her daughter winnie could not help passing a remark to mister verloc that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0006.mp3|mother has been spending half crowns and five shillings almost every day this last week in cab fares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0007.mp3|but the remark was not made grudgingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0009.mp3|she was only a little surprised at this sudden mania for locomotion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0010.mp3|mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0011.mp3|who was sufficiently magnificent in his way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0012.mp3|had grunted the remark impatiently aside as interfering with his meditations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0013.mp3|these were frequent deep and prolonged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0014.mp3|they bore upon a matter more important than five shillings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0015.mp3|distinctly more important|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0016.mp3|and beyond all comparison more difficult to consider in all its aspects with philosophical serenity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0017.mp3|her object attained in astute secrecy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0019.mp3|her soul was triumphant and her heart tremulous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0020.mp3|inwardly she quaked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0022.mp3|self contained character of her daughter winnie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0023.mp3|whose displeasure was made redoubtable by a diversity of dreadful silences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0024.mp3|but she did not allow her inward apprehensions to rob her of the advantage of venerable placidity conferred upon her outward person by her triple chin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0025.mp3|the floating ampleness of her ancient form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0026.mp3|and the impotent condition of her legs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0028.mp3|against her usual practice when addressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0029.mp3|interrupted the domestic occupation she was engaged upon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0030.mp3|it was the dusting of the furniture in the parlour behind the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0031.mp3|she turned her head towards her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0032.mp3|whatever did you want to do that for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0034.mp3|the shock must have been severe to make her depart from that distant and uninquiring acceptance of facts which was her force and her safeguard in life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0035.mp3|weren't you made comfortable enough here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0036.mp3|she had lapsed into these inquiries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0037.mp3|but next moment she saved the consistency of her conduct by resuming her dusting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0038.mp3|while the old woman sat scared and dumb under her dingy white cap and lustreless dark wig|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0040.mp3|and ran the duster along the mahogany at the back of the horse hair sofa on which mister verloc loved to take his ease in hat and overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0041.mp3|she was intent on her work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0042.mp3|but presently she permitted herself another question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0043.mp3|how in the world did you manage it mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0044.mp3|as not affecting the inwardness of things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0046.mp3|this curiosity was excusable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0047.mp3|it bore merely on the methods|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0048.mp3|the old woman welcomed it eagerly as bringing forward something that could be talked about with much sincerity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0049.mp3|she favoured her daughter by an exhaustive answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0050.mp3|full of names and enriched by side comments upon the ravages of time as observed in the alteration of human countenances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0053.mp3|she enlarged with special appreciation on the kindness and condescension of a large brewer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0054.mp3|a baronet and an m p|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0055.mp3|the chairman of the governors of the charity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0056.mp3|she expressed herself thus warmly because she had been allowed to interview by appointment his private secretary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0062.mp3|very thin and quiet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0063.mp3|he was like a shadow my dear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0065.mp3|prolonging her dusting operations till the tale was told to the end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0066.mp3|walked out of the parlour into the kitchen down two steps in her usual manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0067.mp3|without the slightest comment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0070.mp3|because it was her own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0071.mp3|and sometimes she wished it hadn't been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0072.mp3|heroism is all very well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0073.mp3|but there are circumstances when the disposal of a few tables and chairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0075.mp3|and so on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0076.mp3|may be big with remote and disastrous consequences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0077.mp3|she required a few pieces herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0078.mp3|the foundation which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0079.mp3|after many importunities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0080.mp3|had gathered her to its charitable breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0081.mp3|giving nothing but bare planks and cheaply papered bricks to the objects of its solicitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0082.mp3|the delicacy guiding her choice to the least valuable and most dilapidated articles passed unacknowledged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0083.mp3|because winnie's philosophy consisted in not taking notice of the inside of facts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0084.mp3|she assumed that mother took what suited her best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0086.mp3|his intense meditation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0087.mp3|like a sort of chinese wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0088.mp3|isolated him completely from the phenomena of this world of vain effort and illusory appearances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0089.mp3|her selection made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0090.mp3|the disposal of the rest became a perplexing question in a particular way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0091.mp3|she was leaving it in brett street of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0092.mp3|but she had two children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0093.mp3|winnie was provided for by her sensible union with that excellent husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0094.mp3|mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0095.mp3|stevie was destitute and a little peculiar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0096.mp3|his position had to be considered before the claims of legal justice and even the promptings of partiality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0097.mp3|the possession of the furniture would not be in any sense a provision|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0098.mp3|he ought to have it the poor boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0099.mp3|but to give it to him would be like tampering with his position of complete dependence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0100.mp3|it was a sort of claim which she feared to weaken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0102.mp3|the susceptibilities of mister verloc would perhaps not brook being beholden to his brother in law for the chairs he sat on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0103.mp3|in a long experience of gentlemen lodgers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0108.mp3|however carefully made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0109.mp3|might give some cause of offence to winnie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0111.mp3|and at the moment of leaving brett street she had said to her daughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0113.mp3|everything i leave here is altogether your own now my dear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0115.mp3|with her hat on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0116.mp3|silent behind her mother's back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0117.mp3|went on arranging the collar of the old woman's cloak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0120.mp3|they went out at the shop door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0121.mp3|the conveyance awaiting them would have illustrated the proverb that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0122.mp3|truth can be more cruel than caricature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0123.mp3|if such a proverb existed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0124.mp3|crawling behind an infirm horse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0126.mp3|this last peculiarity caused some embarrassment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0127.mp3|catching sight of a hooked iron contrivance protruding from the left sleeve of the man's coat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0129.mp3|she really couldn't trust herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0130.mp3|what do you think winnie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0131.mp3|she hung back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0133.mp3|leaning over from his box he whispered with mysterious indignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0134.mp3|what was the matter now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0135.mp3|was it possible to treat a man so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0136.mp3|his enormous and unwashed countenance flamed red in the muddy stretch of the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0138.mp3|he inquired desperately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0139.mp3|if the police constable of the locality quieted him by a friendly glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0140.mp3|then addressing himself to the two women without marked consideration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0141.mp3|said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0142.mp3|he's been driving a cab for twenty years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0143.mp3|i never knew him to have an accident|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0145.mp3|shouted the driver in a scornful whisper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0146.mp3|the policeman's testimony settled it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0147.mp3|the modest assemblage of seven people mostly under age dispersed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0148.mp3|winnie followed her mother into the cab|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0149.mp3|stevie climbed on the box|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0150.mp3|his vacant mouth and distressed eyes depicted the state of his mind in regard to the transactions which were taking place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0151.mp3|in the narrow streets the progress of the journey was made sensible to those within by the near fronts of the houses gliding past slowly and shakily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0152.mp3|with a great rattle and jingling of glass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0153.mp3|as if about to collapse behind the cab|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0154.mp3|and the infirm horse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0155.mp3|with the harness hung over his sharp backbone flapping very loose about his thighs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0156.mp3|appeared to be dancing mincingly on his toes with infinite patience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0157.mp3|later on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0158.mp3|in the wider space of whitehall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0159.mp3|all visual evidences of motion became imperceptible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0160.mp3|the rattle and jingle of glass went on indefinitely in front of the long treasury building and time itself seemed to stand still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0161.mp3|at last winnie observed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0162.mp3|this isn't a very good horse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0163.mp3|her eyes gleamed in the shadow of the cab straight ahead immovable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0164.mp3|on the box|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0165.mp3|stevie shut his vacant mouth first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0166.mp3|in order to ejaculate earnestly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0167.mp3|don't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0168.mp3|the driver|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0169.mp3|holding high the reins twisted around the hook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0170.mp3|took no notice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0171.mp3|perhaps he had not heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0172.mp3|stevie's breast heaved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0174.mp3|the man turned slowly his bloated and sodden face of many colours bristling with white hairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0175.mp3|his little red eyes glistened with moisture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0177.mp3|they remained closed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0178.mp3|with the dirty back of his whip hand he rubbed the stubble sprouting on his enormous chin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0180.mp3|stammered out stevie violently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0181.mp3|it hurts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0185.mp3|not because his soul was cruel and his heart evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0186.mp3|but because he had to earn his fare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0188.mp3|with its towers and pinnacles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0189.mp3|contemplated in immobility and silence a cab that jingled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0190.mp3|it rolled too however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0191.mp3|but on the bridge there was a commotion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0192.mp3|stevie suddenly proceeded to get down from the box|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0193.mp3|there were shouts on the pavement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0194.mp3|people ran forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0195.mp3|the driver pulled up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0196.mp3|whispering curses of indignation and astonishment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0197.mp3|winnie lowered the window and put her head out white as a ghost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0198.mp3|in the depths of the cab|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0199.mp3|her mother was exclaiming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0200.mp3|in tones of anguish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0201.mp3|is that boy hurt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0202.mp3|is that boy hurt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0203.mp3|stevie was not hurt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0204.mp3|he had not even fallen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0205.mp3|but excitement as usual had robbed him of the power of connected speech|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0206.mp3|he could do no more than stammer at the window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0207.mp3|too heavy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0208.mp3|too heavy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0211.mp3|get up on the box directly and don't try to get down again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0213.mp3|must walk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0214.mp3|in trying to state the nature of that necessity he stammered himself into utter incoherence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0215.mp3|no physical impossibility stood in the way of his whim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0216.mp3|stevie could have managed easily to keep pace with the infirm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0217.mp3|dancing horse without getting out of breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0218.mp3|but his sister withheld her consent decisively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0219.mp3|the idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0221.mp3|run after a cab|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0223.mp3|frightened and helpless in the depths of the conveyance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0224.mp3|entreated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0226.mp3|he'll get lost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0227.mp3|don't let him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0228.mp3|certainly not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0232.mp3|he won't be happy at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0233.mp3|the idea of mister verloc's grief and unhappiness acting as usual powerfully upon stevie's fundamentally docile disposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0234.mp3|he abandoned all resistance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0235.mp3|and climbed up again on the box|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0236.mp3|with a face of despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0237.mp3|the cabby turned at him his enormous and inflamed countenance truculently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0238.mp3|don't you go for trying this silly game again young fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0239.mp3|after delivering himself thus in a stern whisper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0240.mp3|strained almost to extinction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0242.mp3|ruminating solemnly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0243.mp3|to his mind the incident remained somewhat obscure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0244.mp3|but his intellect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0245.mp3|though it had lost its pristine vivacity in the benumbing years of sedentary exposure to the weather|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0246.mp3|lacked not independence or sanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0247.mp3|gravely he dismissed the hypothesis of stevie being a drunken young nipper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0248.mp3|inside the cab the spell of silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0249.mp3|in which the two women had endured shoulder to shoulder the jolting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0252.mp3|had been broken by stevie's outbreak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0253.mp3|winnie raised her voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0254.mp3|you've done what you wanted mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0255.mp3|you'll have only yourself to thank for it if you aren't happy afterwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0256.mp3|and i don't think you'll be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0257.mp3|that i don't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0258.mp3|weren't you comfortable enough in the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0261.mp3|screamed the old woman earnestly above the noise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0262.mp3|you've been the best of daughters to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0263.mp3|as to mister verloc there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0265.mp3|she turned her old tearful eyes to the roof of the cab|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0266.mp3|then she averted her head on the pretence of looking out of the window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0267.mp3|as if to judge of their progress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0268.mp3|it was insignificant and went on close to the curbstone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0270.mp3|the early dirty night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0271.mp3|the sinister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0274.mp3|had overtaken her on her last cab drive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0277.mp3|favoured by the trials of a difficult and worried existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0278.mp3|first as wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0279.mp3|then as widow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0281.mp3|that under the influence of a blush would take on an orange tint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0282.mp3|and this woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0283.mp3|modest indeed but hardened in the fires of adversity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0286.mp3|when blushes are not expected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0287.mp3|had positively blushed before her daughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0288.mp3|in the privacy of a four wheeler|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0290.mp3|might well have been devised in kindness as a place of training for the still more straitened circumstances of the grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0291.mp3|she was forced to hide from her own child a blush of remorse and shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0292.mp3|whatever people will think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0293.mp3|she knew very well what they did think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0296.mp3|whose interest she had solicited with such flattering success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0297.mp3|she had not known before what a good beggar she could be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0298.mp3|but she guessed very well what inference was drawn from her application|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0299.mp3|on account of that shrinking delicacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0300.mp3|which exists side by side with aggressive brutality in masculine nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0302.mp3|she had checked them by a visible compression of the lips and some display of an emotion determined to be eloquently silent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0303.mp3|and the men would become suddenly incurious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0304.mp3|after the manner of their kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0305.mp3|she congratulated herself more than once on having nothing to do with women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0306.mp3|who being naturally more callous and avid of details|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0307.mp3|would have been anxious to be exactly informed by what sort of unkind conduct her daughter and son in law had driven her to that sad extremity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0308.mp3|it was only before the secretary of the great brewer m p and chairman of the charity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0309.mp3|who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0311.mp3|felt bound to be conscientiously inquisitive as to the real circumstances of the applicant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0312.mp3|that she had burst into tears outright and aloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0313.mp3|as a cornered woman will weep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0314.mp3|the thin and polite gentleman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0315.mp3|after contemplating her with an air of being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0316.mp3|struck all of a heap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0317.mp3|abandoned his position under the cover of soothing remarks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0318.mp3|she must not distress herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0319.mp3|the deed of the charity did not absolutely specify|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0320.mp3|childless widows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0321.mp3|in fact it did not by any means disqualify her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0322.mp3|but the discretion of the committee must be an informed discretion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0325.mp3|thereupon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0326.mp3|to his profound disappointment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0328.mp3|the tears of that large female in a dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0332.mp3|she had wept because she was heroic and unscrupulous and full of love for both her children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0333.mp3|girls frequently get sacrificed to the welfare of the boys|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0334.mp3|in this case she was sacrificing winnie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0335.mp3|by the suppression of truth she was slandering her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0338.mp3|and need not care for the opinion of people that she would never see and who would never see her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0339.mp3|whereas poor stevie had nothing in the world he could call his own except his mother's heroism and unscrupulousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0340.mp3|the first sense of security following on winnie's marriage wore off in time for nothing lasts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0342.mp3|in the seclusion of the back bedroom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0343.mp3|had recalled the teaching of that experience which the world impresses upon a widowed woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0344.mp3|but she had recalled it without vain bitterness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0349.mp3|that the way of kindness should be made easy to the well disposed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0350.mp3|that her daughter winnie was a most devoted sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0351.mp3|and a very self confident wife indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0352.mp3|as regards winnie's sisterly devotion her stoicism flinched|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0354.mp3|she could not help it not to do so would have frightened her too much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0355.mp3|but in considering the conditions of her daughter's married state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0356.mp3|she rejected firmly all flattering illusions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0358.mp3|that excellent man loved his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0363.mp3|it would be better if its whole effect were concentrated on poor stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0364.mp3|and the heroic old woman resolved on going away from her children as an act of devotion and as a move of deep policy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0368.mp3|that stevie's moral claim would be strengthened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0369.mp3|the poor boy a good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0371.mp3|if a little peculiar had not a sufficient standing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0372.mp3|he had been taken over with his mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0373.mp3|somewhat in the same way as the furniture of the belgravian mansion had been taken over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0374.mp3|as if on the ground of belonging to her exclusively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0375.mp3|what will happen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0377.mp3|when i die|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0378.mp3|and when she asked herself that question it was with dread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0379.mp3|it was also terrible to think that she would not then have the means of knowing what happened to the poor boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0380.mp3|but by making him over to his sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0381.mp3|by going thus away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0382.mp3|she gave him the advantage of a directly dependent position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0384.mp3|her act of abandonment was really an arrangement for settling her son permanently in life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0385.mp3|other people made material sacrifices for such an object|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0386.mp3|she in that way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0387.mp3|it was the only way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0388.mp3|moreover she would be able to see how it worked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0389.mp3|ill or well she would avoid the horrible incertitude on the death bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0391.mp3|the cab rattled jingled jolted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0392.mp3|in fact the last was quite extraordinary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0393.mp3|by its disproportionate violence and magnitude it obliterated every sensation of onward movement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0396.mp3|it was extremely distressing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0402.mp3|of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0403.mp3|answered winnie shortly staring straight before her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0405.mp3|greasy shop in a blaze of gas and in the smell of fried fish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0407.mp3|and my dear i must see that poor boy every sunday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0408.mp3|he won't mind spending the day with his old mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0411.mp3|i should think not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0412.mp3|that poor boy will miss you something cruel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0413.mp3|i wish you had thought a little of that mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0414.mp3|not think of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0416.mp3|which had tried to jump out of her throat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0418.mp3|pouting at the front of the cab|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0419.mp3|then snapped out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0420.mp3|which was an unusual tone with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0421.mp3|i expect i'll have a job with him at first he'll be that restless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0422.mp3|whatever you do don't let him worry your husband my dear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0424.mp3|and the cab jolted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0426.mp3|could stevie be trusted to come all that way alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0430.mp3|they agreed as to that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0431.mp3|it could not be denied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0432.mp3|much less hardly at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0433.mp3|they shouted at each other in the jingle with comparative cheerfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0434.mp3|but suddenly the maternal anxiety broke out afresh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0436.mp3|it was too difficult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0437.mp3|the old woman gave way to grief and consternation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0439.mp3|don't you upset yourself like this mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0440.mp3|you must see him of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0442.mp3|i'll try not to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0443.mp3|she mopped her streaming eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0444.mp3|but you can't spare the time to come with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0446.mp3|his name and address may slip his memory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0447.mp3|and he'll remain lost for days and days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0448.mp3|the vision of a workhouse infirmary for poor stevie if only during inquiries wrung her heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0449.mp3|for she was a proud woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0451.mp3|i can't bring him to you myself every week|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0452.mp3|she cried|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0453.mp3|but don't you worry mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0455.mp3|they felt a peculiar bump|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0456.mp3|a vision of brick pillars lingered before the rattling windows of the cab|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0458.mp3|what had happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0459.mp3|they sat motionless and scared in the profound stillness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0460.mp3|till the door came open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0462.mp3|strained whispering was heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0465.mp3|each with one dim yellow window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0466.mp3|on the ground floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0467.mp3|surrounded the dark open space of a grass plot planted with shrubs and railed off from the patchwork of lights and shadows in the wide road|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0468.mp3|resounding with the dull rumble of traffic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0469.mp3|before the door of one of these tiny houses one without a light in the little downstairs window the cab had come to a standstill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0471.mp3|winnie lingered on the flagstone path to pay the cabman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0473.mp3|after helping to carry inside a lot of small parcels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0474.mp3|came out and stood under the light of a gas lamp belonging to the charity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0475.mp3|the cabman looked at the pieces of silver|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0477.mp3|appearing very minute in his big|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0480.mp3|he had been paid decently four one shilling pieces and he contemplated them in perfect stillness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0481.mp3|as if they had been the surprising terms of a melancholy problem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0482.mp3|the slow transfer of that treasure to an inner pocket demanded much laborious groping in the depths of decayed clothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0483.mp3|his form was squat and without flexibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0486.mp3|his shoulders a little up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0487.mp3|and his hands thrust deep in the side pockets of his warm overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0488.mp3|stood at the edge of the path|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0490.mp3|the cabman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0491.mp3|pausing in his deliberate movements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0492.mp3|seemed struck by some misty recollection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0495.mp3|he whispered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0496.mp3|you'll know him again won't you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0497.mp3|stevie was staring at the horse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0498.mp3|whose hind quarters appeared unduly elevated by the effect of emaciation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0499.mp3|the little stiff tail seemed to have been fitted in for a heartless joke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0500.mp3|and at the other end the thin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0502.mp3|like a plank covered with old horse hide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0503.mp3|drooped to the ground under the weight of an enormous bony head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0504.mp3|the ears hung at different angles negligently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0506.mp3|the cabman struck lightly stevie's breast with the iron hook protruding from a ragged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0507.mp3|greasy sleeve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0510.mp3|stevie looked vacantly into the fierce little eyes with red edged lids|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0511.mp3|he ain't lame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0512.mp3|pursued the other whispering with energy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0517.mp3|extinct voice invested his utterance with a character of vehement secrecy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0518.mp3|stevie's vacant gaze was changing slowly into dread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0519.mp3|you may well look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0522.mp3|looking for fares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0524.mp3|his jovial purple cheeks bristled with white hairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0527.mp3|his face smeared with the juice of berries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0529.mp3|he talked to stevie of domestic matters and the affairs of men whose sufferings are great and immortality by no means assured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0530.mp3|i am a night cabby i am|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0531.mp3|he whispered with a sort of boastful exasperation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0534.mp3|the monstrous nature of that declaration of paternity seemed to strike the world dumb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0535.mp3|a silence reigned during which the flanks of the old horse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0536.mp3|the steed of apocalyptic misery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0537.mp3|smoked upwards in the light of the charitable gas lamp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0538.mp3|the cabman grunted then added in his mysterious whisper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0540.mp3|stevie's face had been twitching for some time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0541.mp3|and at last his feelings burst out in their usual concise form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0542.mp3|bad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0543.mp3|bad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0544.mp3|his gaze remained fixed on the ribs of the horse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0545.mp3|self conscious and sombre|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0546.mp3|as though he were afraid to look about him at the badness of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0547.mp3|and his slenderness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0548.mp3|his rosy lips and pale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0549.mp3|clear complexion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0550.mp3|gave him the aspect of a delicate boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0551.mp3|notwithstanding the fluffy growth of golden hair on his cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0552.mp3|he pouted in a scared way like a child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0553.mp3|the cabman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0554.mp3|short and broad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0560.mp3|stammered out stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0561.mp3|pushing his hands deeper into his pockets with convulsive sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0562.mp3|he could say nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0563.mp3|for the tenderness to all pain and all misery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0564.mp3|the desire to make the horse happy and the cabman happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0565.mp3|had reached the point of a bizarre longing to take them to bed with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0566.mp3|and that he knew was impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0567.mp3|for stevie was not mad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0568.mp3|it was as it were a symbolic longing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0569.mp3|and at the same time it was very distinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0570.mp3|because springing from experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0571.mp3|the mother of wisdom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0572.mp3|thus when as a child he cowered in a dark corner scared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0575.mp3|and miserable with the black|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0576.mp3|black misery of the soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0578.mp3|and carry him off to bed with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0579.mp3|as into a heaven of consoling peace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0581.mp3|though apt to forget mere facts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0583.mp3|had a faithful memory of sensations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0584.mp3|to be taken into a bed of compassion was the supreme remedy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0585.mp3|with the only one disadvantage of being difficult of application on a large scale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0586.mp3|and looking at the cabman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0587.mp3|stevie perceived this clearly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0588.mp3|because he was reasonable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0589.mp3|the cabman went on with his leisurely preparations as if stevie had not existed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0590.mp3|he made as if to hoist himself on the box|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0591.mp3|but at the last moment from some obscure motive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0592.mp3|perhaps merely from disgust with carriage exercise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0593.mp3|desisted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0594.mp3|he approached instead the motionless partner of his labours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0595.mp3|and stooping to seize the bridle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0596.mp3|lifted up the big|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0597.mp3|weary head to the height of his shoulder with one effort of his right arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0598.mp3|like a feat of strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0600.mp3|he whispered secretly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0601.mp3|limping he led the cab away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0602.mp3|there was an air of austerity in this departure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0603.mp3|the scrunched gravel of the drive crying out under the slowly turning wheels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0605.mp3|the plaint of the gravel travelled slowly all round the drive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0606.mp3|between the lamps of the charitable gateway the slow cortege reappeared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0607.mp3|lighted up for a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0609.mp3|thick man limping busily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0610.mp3|with the horse's head held aloft in his fist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0613.mp3|low box on wheels rolling behind comically with an air of waddling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0614.mp3|they turned to the left|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0615.mp3|there was a pub down the street within fifty yards of the gate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0616.mp3|stevie left alone beside the private lamp post of the charity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0617.mp3|his hands thrust deep into his pockets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0618.mp3|glared with vacant sulkiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0619.mp3|at the bottom of his pockets his incapable weak hands were clinched hard into a pair of angry fists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0620.mp3|in the face of anything which affected directly or indirectly his morbid dread of pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0621.mp3|stevie ended by turning vicious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0622.mp3|a magnanimous indignation swelled his frail chest to bursting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0623.mp3|and caused his candid eyes to squint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0624.mp3|supremely wise in knowing his own powerlessness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0625.mp3|stevie was not wise enough to restrain his passions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0627.mp3|the anguish of immoderate compassion was succeeded by the pain of an innocent but pitiless rage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0628.mp3|those two states expressing themselves outwardly by the same signs of futile bodily agitation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0629.mp3|his sister winnie soothed his excitement without ever fathoming its twofold character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0631.mp3|this is a sort of economy having all the appearances and some of the advantages of prudence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0632.mp3|obviously it may be good for one not to know too much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0633.mp3|and such a view accords very well with constitutional indolence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0635.mp3|winnie verloc did not investigate her brother's psychology|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0636.mp3|the poor boy was excited of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0638.mp3|she took her brother's arm to walk away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0641.mp3|she felt that the boy was very much excited indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0642.mp3|holding tight to his arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0643.mp3|under the appearance of leaning on it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0644.mp3|she thought of some words suitable to the occasion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0647.mp3|you must look well after me at the crossings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0649.mp3|like a good brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0651.mp3|it flattered him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0652.mp3|he raised his head and threw out his chest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0653.mp3|don't be nervous winnie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0654.mp3|mustn't be nervous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0658.mp3|he advanced fearlessly with the woman on his arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0659.mp3|but his lower lip dropped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0661.mp3|on the pavement of the squalid and wide thoroughfare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0663.mp3|their resemblance to each other was so pronounced as to strike the casual passers by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0664.mp3|before the doors of the public house at the corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0666.mp3|a four wheeled cab standing by the curbstone with no one on the box|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0669.mp3|its aspect was so profoundly lamentable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0673.mp3|with that ready compassion of a woman for a horse when she is not sitting behind him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0674.mp3|exclaimed vaguely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0676.mp3|hanging back suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0679.mp3|poor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0680.mp3|he ejaculated appreciatively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0681.mp3|cabman poor too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0682.mp3|he told me himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0683.mp3|the contemplation of the infirm and lonely steed overcame him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0685.mp3|but obstinate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0686.mp3|he would remain there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0688.mp3|but it was very difficult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0689.mp3|poor brute poor people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0690.mp3|was all he could repeat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0691.mp3|it did not seem forcible enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0692.mp3|and he came to a stop with an angry splutter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0694.mp3|stevie was no master of phrases|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0695.mp3|and perhaps for that very reason his thoughts lacked clearness and precision|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0696.mp3|but he felt with greater completeness and some profundity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0699.mp3|of his poor kids at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0700.mp3|and stevie knew what it was to be beaten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0701.mp3|he knew it from experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0702.mp3|it was a bad world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0706.mp3|his only sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0709.mp3|could not pretend to such depths of insight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0710.mp3|moreover she had not experienced the magic of the cabman's eloquence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0713.mp3|and she said placidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0714.mp3|come along stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0715.mp3|you can't help that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0716.mp3|the docile stevie went along|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0717.mp3|but now he went along without pride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0718.mp3|shamblingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0719.mp3|and muttering half words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0720.mp3|and even words that would have been whole if they had not been made up of halves that did not belong to each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0721.mp3|it was as though he had been trying to fit all the words he could remember to his sentiments in order to get some sort of corresponding idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0723.mp3|he hung back to utter it at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0724.mp3|bad world for poor people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0725.mp3|directly he had expressed that thought he became aware that it was familiar to him already in all its consequences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0726.mp3|this circumstance strengthened his conviction immensely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0727.mp3|but also augmented his indignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0729.mp3|he felt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0730.mp3|ought to be punished for it punished with great severity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0731.mp3|being no sceptic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0733.mp3|he was in a manner at the mercy of his righteous passions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0734.mp3|beastly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0735.mp3|he added concisely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0737.mp3|nobody can help that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0738.mp3|she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0739.mp3|do come along|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0740.mp3|is that the way you're taking care of me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0741.mp3|stevie mended his pace obediently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0742.mp3|he prided himself on being a good brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0743.mp3|his morality which was very complete demanded that from him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0744.mp3|yet he was pained at the information imparted by his sister winnie who was good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0745.mp3|nobody could help that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0746.mp3|he came along gloomily but presently he brightened up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0747.mp3|like the rest of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0748.mp3|perplexed by the mystery of the universe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0751.mp3|he suggested confidently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0752.mp3|the police aren't for that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0754.mp3|stevie's face lengthened considerably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0755.mp3|he was thinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0756.mp3|the more intense his thinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0757.mp3|the slacker was the droop of his lower jaw|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0758.mp3|and it was with an aspect of hopeless vacancy that he gave up his intellectual enterprise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0759.mp3|not for that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0760.mp3|he mumbled resigned but surprised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0762.mp3|he had formed for himself an ideal conception of the metropolitan police as a sort of benevolent institution for the suppression of evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0763.mp3|the notion of benevolence especially was very closely associated with his sense of the power of the men in blue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0764.mp3|he had liked all police constables tenderly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0765.mp3|with a guileless trustfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0766.mp3|and he was pained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0767.mp3|he was irritated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0769.mp3|by a suspicion of duplicity in the members of the force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0770.mp3|for stevie was frank and as open as the day himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0771.mp3|what did they mean by pretending then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0772.mp3|unlike his sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0773.mp3|who put her trust in face values|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0774.mp3|he wished to go to the bottom of the matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0775.mp3|he carried on his inquiry by means of an angry challenge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0777.mp3|what are they for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0778.mp3|tell me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0779.mp3|winnie disliked controversy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0780.mp3|but fearing most a fit of black depression consequent on stevie missing his mother very much at first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0781.mp3|she did not altogether decline the discussion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0782.mp3|guiltless of all irony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0784.mp3|delegate of the central red committee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0785.mp3|personal friend of certain anarchists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0786.mp3|and a votary of social revolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0789.mp3|she avoided using the verb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0790.mp3|to steal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0791.mp3|because it always made her brother uncomfortable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0792.mp3|for stevie was delicately honest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0793.mp3|certain simple principles had been instilled into him so anxiously on account of his|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0795.mp3|that the mere names of certain transgressions filled him with horror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0797.mp3|he was impressed and startled now and his intelligence was very alert|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0799.mp3|he asked at once anxiously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0800.mp3|not even if they were hungry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0801.mp3|mustn't they|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0802.mp3|the two had paused in their walk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0803.mp3|not if they were ever so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0805.mp3|with the equanimity of a person untroubled by the problem of the distribution of wealth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0806.mp3|and exploring the perspective of the roadway for an omnibus of the right colour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0807.mp3|certainly not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0808.mp3|but what's the use of talking about all that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0809.mp3|you aren't ever hungry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0810.mp3|she cast a swift glance at the boy like a young man by her side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0811.mp3|she saw him amiable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0812.mp3|attractive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0813.mp3|affectionate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0814.mp3|and only a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0817.mp3|and she could not see him otherwise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0818.mp3|for he was connected with what there was of the salt of passion in her tasteless life the passion of indignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0819.mp3|of courage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0820.mp3|of pity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0821.mp3|and even of self sacrifice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0822.mp3|she did not add|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0823.mp3|and you aren't likely ever to be as long as i live|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0824.mp3|but she might very well have done so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0825.mp3|since she had taken effectual steps to that end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0826.mp3|mister verloc was a very good husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0827.mp3|it was her honest impression that nobody could help liking the boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0828.mp3|she cried out suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0829.mp3|quick stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0831.mp3|and stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0834.mp3|with complete success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0835.mp3|an hour afterwards mister verloc raised his eyes from a newspaper he was reading|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0836.mp3|or at any rate looking at|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0837.mp3|behind the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0840.mp3|enter and cross the shop on her way upstairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0841.mp3|followed by stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0842.mp3|his brother in law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0843.mp3|the sight of his wife was agreeable to mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0844.mp3|it was his idiosyncrasy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0846.mp3|he looked after his wife fixedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0847.mp3|without a word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0848.mp3|as though she had been a phantom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0849.mp3|his voice for home use was husky and placid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0851.mp3|it was not heard at supper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0852.mp3|to which he was called by his wife in the usual brief manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0854.mp3|he sat down to consume it without conviction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0855.mp3|wearing his hat pushed far back on his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0856.mp3|it was not devotion to an outdoor life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0859.mp3|twice at the clatter of the cracked bell he arose without a word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0860.mp3|disappeared into the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0861.mp3|and came back silently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0863.mp3|becoming acutely aware of the vacant place at her right hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0864.mp3|missed her mother very much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0865.mp3|and stared stonily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0867.mp3|from the same reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0868.mp3|kept on shuffling his feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0869.mp3|as though the floor under the table were uncomfortably hot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0870.mp3|when mister verloc returned to sit in his place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0871.mp3|like the very embodiment of silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0873.mp3|and stevie ceased to fidget with his feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0874.mp3|because of his great and awed regard for his sister's husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0875.mp3|he directed at him glances of respectful compassion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0876.mp3|mister verloc was sorry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0877.mp3|his sister winnie had impressed upon him in the omnibus that mister verloc would be found at home in a state of sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0878.mp3|and must not be worried|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0879.mp3|his father's anger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0880.mp3|the irritability of gentlemen lodgers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0881.mp3|and mister verloc's predisposition to immoderate grief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0882.mp3|had been the main sanctions of stevie's self restraint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0883.mp3|of these sentiments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0884.mp3|all easily provoked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0885.mp3|but not always easy to understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0886.mp3|the last had the greatest moral efficiency because mister verloc was good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0888.mp3|they had established|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0889.mp3|erected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0890.mp3|consecrated it behind mister verloc's back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0891.mp3|for reasons that had nothing to do with abstract morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0892.mp3|and mister verloc was not aware of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0893.mp3|it is but bare justice to him to say that he had no notion of appearing good to stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0894.mp3|yet so it was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0895.mp3|he was even the only man so qualified in stevie's knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0896.mp3|because the gentlemen lodgers had been too transient and too remote to have anything very distinct about them but perhaps their boots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0897.mp3|and as regards the disciplinary measures of his father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0898.mp3|the desolation of his mother and sister shrank from setting up a theory of goodness before the victim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0899.mp3|it would have been too cruel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0900.mp3|and it was even possible that stevie would not have believed them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0901.mp3|as far as mister verloc was concerned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0902.mp3|nothing could stand in the way of stevie's belief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0903.mp3|mister verloc was obviously yet mysteriously good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0904.mp3|and the grief of a good man is august|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0905.mp3|stevie gave glances of reverential compassion to his brother in law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0906.mp3|mister verloc was sorry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0907.mp3|the brother of winnie had never before felt himself in such close communion with the mystery of that man's goodness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0908.mp3|it was an understandable sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0909.mp3|and stevie himself was sorry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0910.mp3|he was very sorry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0911.mp3|the same sort of sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0912.mp3|and his attention being drawn to this unpleasant state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0913.mp3|stevie shuffled his feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0914.mp3|his feelings were habitually manifested by the agitation of his limbs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0915.mp3|keep your feet quiet dear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0917.mp3|then turning towards her husband in an indifferent voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0918.mp3|the masterly achievement of instinctive tact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0920.mp3|she asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0921.mp3|the mere suggestion seemed repugnant to mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0922.mp3|he shook his head moodily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0923.mp3|and then sat still with downcast eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0924.mp3|looking at the piece of cheese on his plate for a whole minute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0925.mp3|at the end of that time he got up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0926.mp3|and went out went right out in the clatter of the shop door bell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0927.mp3|he acted thus inconsistently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0928.mp3|not from any desire to make himself unpleasant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0929.mp3|but because of an unconquerable restlessness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0930.mp3|it was no earthly good going out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0931.mp3|he could not find anywhere in london what he wanted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0932.mp3|but he went out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0933.mp3|he led a cortege of dismal thoughts along dark streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0934.mp3|through lighted streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0935.mp3|in and out of two flash bars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0936.mp3|as if in a half hearted attempt to make a night of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0937.mp3|and finally back again to his menaced home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0938.mp3|where he sat down fatigued behind the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0939.mp3|and they crowded urgently round him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0940.mp3|like a pack of hungry black hounds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0941.mp3|after locking up the house and putting out the gas he took them upstairs with him a dreadful escort for a man going to bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0942.mp3|his wife had preceded him some time before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0943.mp3|and with her ample form defined vaguely under the counterpane|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0945.mp3|and a hand under the cheek offered to his distraction the view of early drowsiness arguing the possession of an equable soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0946.mp3|her big eyes stared wide open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0947.mp3|inert and dark against the snowy whiteness of the linen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0948.mp3|she did not move|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0949.mp3|she had an equable soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0950.mp3|she felt profoundly that things do not stand much looking into|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0951.mp3|she made her force and her wisdom of that instinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0952.mp3|but the taciturnity of mister verloc had been lying heavily upon her for a good many days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0953.mp3|it was as a matter of fact affecting her nerves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0954.mp3|recumbent and motionless she said placidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0955.mp3|you'll catch cold walking about in your socks like this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0956.mp3|this speech|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0957.mp3|becoming the solicitude of the wife and the prudence of the woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0959.mp3|he had left his boots downstairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0960.mp3|but he had forgotten to put on his slippers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0961.mp3|and he had been turning about the bedroom on noiseless pads like a bear in a cage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0964.mp3|but she did not move her black head sunk in the white pillow one hand under her cheek and the big|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0967.mp3|under her husband's expressionless stare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0968.mp3|and remembering her mother's empty room across the landing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0969.mp3|she felt an acute pang of loneliness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0970.mp3|she had never been parted from her mother before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0971.mp3|they had stood by each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0972.mp3|she felt that they had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0973.mp3|and she said to herself that now mother was gone gone for good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0975.mp3|stevie remained however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0976.mp3|and she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0977.mp3|mother's done what she wanted to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0978.mp3|there's no sense in it that i can see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0980.mp3|it's perfectly wicked leaving us like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0981.mp3|mister verloc was not a well read person|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0983.mp3|but there was a peculiar aptness in circumstances which made him think of rats leaving a doomed ship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0984.mp3|he very nearly said so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0985.mp3|he had grown suspicious and embittered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0986.mp3|could it be that the old woman had such an excellent nose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0987.mp3|but the unreasonableness of such a suspicion was patent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0988.mp3|and mister verloc held his tongue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0989.mp3|not altogether however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0990.mp3|he muttered heavily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0991.mp3|perhaps it's just as well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0992.mp3|he began to undress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0994.mp3|perfectly still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0995.mp3|with her eyes fixed in a dreamy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0997.mp3|and her heart for the fraction of a second seemed to stand still too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_0999.mp3|not quite herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1000.mp3|as the saying is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1001.mp3|and it was borne upon her with some force that a simple sentence may hold several diverse meanings mostly disagreeable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1002.mp3|how was it just as well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1003.mp3|and why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1004.mp3|but she did not allow herself to fall into the idleness of barren speculation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1005.mp3|she was rather confirmed in her belief that things did not stand being looked into|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1006.mp3|practical and subtle in her way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1007.mp3|she brought stevie to the front without loss of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1011.mp3|and he's such a good boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1012.mp3|i couldn't do without him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1013.mp3|mister verloc went on divesting himself of his clothing with the unnoticing inward concentration of a man undressing in the solitude of a vast and hopeless desert|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1014.mp3|for thus inhospitably did this fair earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1015.mp3|our common inheritance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1016.mp3|present itself to the mental vision of mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1017.mp3|all was so still without and within that the lonely ticking of the clock on the landing stole into the room as if for the sake of company|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1018.mp3|mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1019.mp3|getting into bed on his own side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1021.mp3|his thick arms rested abandoned on the outside of the counterpane like dropped weapons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1022.mp3|like discarded tools|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1023.mp3|at that moment he was within a hair's breadth of making a clean breast of it all to his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1024.mp3|the moment seemed propitious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1025.mp3|looking out of the corners of his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1026.mp3|he saw her ample shoulders draped in white|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1027.mp3|the back of her head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1029.mp3|and he forbore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1034.mp3|those ample shoulders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1035.mp3|had an aspect of familiar sacredness the sacredness of domestic peace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1036.mp3|she moved not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1037.mp3|massive and shapeless like a recumbent statue in the rough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1038.mp3|he remembered her wide open eyes looking into the empty room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1039.mp3|she was mysterious with the mysteriousness of living beings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1041.mp3|he was easily intimidated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1042.mp3|and he was also indolent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1043.mp3|with the indolence which is so often the secret of good nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1044.mp3|he forbore touching that mystery out of love timidity and indolence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1045.mp3|there would be always time enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1046.mp3|for several minutes he bore his sufferings silently in the drowsy silence of the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1047.mp3|and then he disturbed it by a resolute declaration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1049.mp3|his wife might have fallen asleep already|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1050.mp3|he could not tell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1052.mp3|her eyes remained very wide open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1053.mp3|and she lay very still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1056.mp3|he renewed his stock from paris and brussels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1057.mp3|often he went over to make his purchases personally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1058.mp3|a little select connection of amateurs was forming around the shop in brett street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1059.mp3|a secret connection eminently proper for any business undertaken by mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1061.mp3|by a mystic accord of temperament and necessity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1062.mp3|had been set apart to be a secret agent all his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1063.mp3|he waited for a while then added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1064.mp3|i'll be away a week or perhaps a fortnight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1067.mp3|victim of her marriage with a debauched joiner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1068.mp3|she was oppressed by the needs of many infant children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1071.mp3|she exhaled the anguish of the poor in a breath of soap suds and rum|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1073.mp3|in the clatter of tin pails|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1075.mp3|full of deep purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1076.mp3|spoke in the tone of the shallowest indifference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1077.mp3|there is no need to have the woman here all day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1078.mp3|i shall do very well with stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1079.mp3|she let the lonely clock on the landing count off fifteen ticks into the abyss of eternity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1080.mp3|and asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1081.mp3|shall i put the light out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1082.mp3|mister verloc snapped at his wife huskily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_08_conrad_1083.mp3|put it out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0001.mp3|brought back a mind evidently unrefreshed by the wonders of foreign travel and a countenance unlighted by the joys of home coming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0002.mp3|he entered in the clatter of the shop bell with an air of sombre and vexed exhaustion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0003.mp3|his bag in hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0004.mp3|his head lowered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0005.mp3|he strode straight behind the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0006.mp3|and let himself fall into the chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0007.mp3|as though he had tramped all the way from dover|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0008.mp3|it was early morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0010.mp3|dusting various objects displayed in the front windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0013.mp3|said mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0014.mp3|giving a slight kick to the gladstone bag on the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0015.mp3|and stevie flung himself upon it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0017.mp3|bore it off with triumphant devotion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0018.mp3|he was so prompt that mister verloc was distinctly surprised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0021.mp3|had looked through the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0022.mp3|and rising from her knees had gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0024.mp3|and grimy with everlasting toil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0026.mp3|there was the master come back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0028.mp3|you'll want some breakfast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0029.mp3|she said from a distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0030.mp3|mister verloc moved his hands slightly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0031.mp3|as if overcome by an impossible suggestion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0032.mp3|but once enticed into the parlour he did not reject the food set before him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0033.mp3|he ate as if in a public place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0034.mp3|his hat pushed off his forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0035.mp3|the skirts of his heavy overcoat hanging in a triangle on each side of the chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0036.mp3|and across the length of the table covered with brown oil cloth winnie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0037.mp3|his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0038.mp3|talked evenly at him the wifely talk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0039.mp3|as artfully adapted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0041.mp3|to the circumstances of this return as the talk of penelope to the return of the wandering odysseus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0043.mp3|but she had had all the upstairs room cleaned thoroughly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0044.mp3|had sold some wares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0046.mp3|he had told her the last time that he was going away to live in a cottage in the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0051.mp3|wicked old housekeeper of his|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0052.mp3|he was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0053.mp3|a disgusting old man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0055.mp3|whom she had received curtly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0057.mp3|she said nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0059.mp3|with the faintest possible blush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0060.mp3|and bringing in her brother stevie as soon as she could into the current of domestic events|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0061.mp3|she mentioned that the boy had moped a good deal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0063.mp3|mister verloc neither said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0064.mp3|damn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0065.mp3|nor yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0066.mp3|stevie be hanged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0068.mp3|not let into the secret of his thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0069.mp3|failed to appreciate the generosity of this restraint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0070.mp3|it isn't that he doesn't work as well as ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0071.mp3|she continued|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0072.mp3|he's been making himself very useful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0073.mp3|you'd think he couldn't do enough for us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0075.mp3|who sat on his right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0076.mp3|delicate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0077.mp3|pale faced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0079.mp3|it was not a critical glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0080.mp3|it had no intention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0081.mp3|and if mister verloc thought for a moment that his wife's brother looked uncommonly useless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0082.mp3|it was only a dull and fleeting thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0083.mp3|devoid of that force and durability which enables sometimes a thought to move the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0084.mp3|leaning back mister verloc uncovered his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0085.mp3|before his extended arm could put down the hat stevie pounced upon it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0086.mp3|and bore it off reverently into the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0087.mp3|and again mister verloc was surprised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0088.mp3|you could do anything with that boy adolf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0090.mp3|he would go through fire for you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0092.mp3|she paused attentive her ear turned towards the door of the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0094.mp3|at stevie's appearance she groaned lamentably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0095.mp3|having observed that he could be induced easily to bestow for the benefit of her infant children the shilling his sister winnie presented him with from time to time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0096.mp3|on all fours amongst the puddles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0097.mp3|wet and begrimed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0099.mp3|she uttered the usual exordium|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0100.mp3|it's all very well for you kept doing nothing like a gentleman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0101.mp3|and she followed it with the everlasting plaint of the poor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0102.mp3|pathetically mendacious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0105.mp3|and she was sincere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0107.mp3|misty eyes swam in tears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0108.mp3|because she felt really the want of some sort of stimulant in the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0111.mp3|they can't be all so little as she makes them out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0112.mp3|some of them must be big enough by now to try to do something for themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0113.mp3|it only makes stevie angry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0114.mp3|these words were confirmed by a thud as of a fist striking the kitchen table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0115.mp3|in the normal evolution of his sympathy stevie had become angry on discovering that he had no shilling in his pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0118.mp3|privations he felt that somebody should be made to suffer for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0120.mp3|stop that nonsense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0121.mp3|and she did it firmly but gently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0124.mp3|as coming from a person disinclined to look under the surface of things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0127.mp3|in the afternoon of the same day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0128.mp3|as mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0130.mp3|declared his intention of going out for a walk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0131.mp3|winnie said from the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0132.mp3|i wish you would take that boy out with you adolf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0133.mp3|for the third time that day mister verloc was surprised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0134.mp3|he stared stupidly at his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0135.mp3|she continued in her steady manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0136.mp3|the boy whenever he was not doing anything moped in the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0137.mp3|it made her uneasy it made her nervous she confessed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0141.mp3|stevie moped in the striking fashion of an unhappy domestic animal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0142.mp3|he would go up on the dark landing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0143.mp3|to sit on the floor at the foot of the tall clock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0144.mp3|with his knees drawn up and his head in his hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0145.mp3|to come upon his pallid face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0146.mp3|with its big eyes gleaming in the dusk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0147.mp3|was discomposing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0148.mp3|to think of him up there was uncomfortable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0149.mp3|mister verloc got used to the startling novelty of the idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0150.mp3|he was fond of his wife as a man should be that is generously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0151.mp3|but a weighty objection presented itself to his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0152.mp3|and he formulated it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0153.mp3|he'll lose sight of me perhaps and get lost in the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0154.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0156.mp3|he won't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0157.mp3|you don't know him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0158.mp3|that boy just worships you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0159.mp3|but if you should miss him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0161.mp3|you just go on and have your walk out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0162.mp3|don't worry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0163.mp3|he'll be all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0164.mp3|he's sure to turn up safe here before very long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0165.mp3|this optimism procured for mister verloc his fourth surprise of the day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0167.mp3|he grunted doubtfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0168.mp3|but perhaps his brother in law was not such an idiot as he looked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0169.mp3|his wife would know best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0170.mp3|he turned away his heavy eyes saying huskily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0171.mp3|well let him come along then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0172.mp3|and relapsed into the clutches of black care|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0173.mp3|that perhaps prefers to sit behind a horseman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0174.mp3|but knows also how to tread close on the heels of people not sufficiently well off to keep horses like mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0177.mp3|at the shop door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0179.mp3|she watched the two figures down the squalid street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0180.mp3|one tall and burly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0181.mp3|the other slight and short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0182.mp3|with a thin neck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0183.mp3|and the peaked shoulders raised slightly under the large semi transparent ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0184.mp3|the material of their overcoats was the same|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0185.mp3|their hats were black and round in shape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0186.mp3|inspired by the similarity of wearing apparel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0188.mp3|might be father and son|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0189.mp3|she said to herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0190.mp3|she thought also that mister verloc was as much of a father as poor stevie ever had in his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0191.mp3|she was aware also that it was her work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0192.mp3|and with peaceful pride she congratulated herself on a certain resolution she had taken a few years before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0193.mp3|it had cost her some effort and even a few tears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0194.mp3|she congratulated herself still more on observing in the course of days that mister verloc seemed to be taking kindly to stevie's companionship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0196.mp3|when ready to go out for his walk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0197.mp3|mister verloc called aloud to the boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0203.mp3|in a different manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0204.mp3|in the house mister verloc could be detected staring curiously at stevie a good deal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0205.mp3|his own demeanour had changed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0206.mp3|taciturn still he was not so listless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0208.mp3|it might have been regarded as an improvement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0209.mp3|as to stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0210.mp3|he moped no longer at the foot of the clock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0211.mp3|but muttered to himself in corners instead in a threatening tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0212.mp3|when asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0214.mp3|he merely opened his mouth and squinted at his sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0215.mp3|at odd times he clenched his fists without apparent cause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0216.mp3|and when discovered in solitude would be scowling at the wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0217.mp3|with the sheet of paper and the pencil given him for drawing circles lying blank and idle on the kitchen table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0218.mp3|this was a change but it was no improvement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0220.mp3|began to fear that stevie was hearing more than was good for him of her husband's conversations with his friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0223.mp3|mister verloc of course met and conversed with various persons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0224.mp3|it could hardly be otherwise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0225.mp3|his walks were an integral part of his outdoor activities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0226.mp3|which his wife had never looked deeply into|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0228.mp3|but she faced it with the same impenetrable calmness which impressed and even astonished the customers of the shop and made the other visitors keep their distance a little wonderingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0230.mp3|she feared that there were things not good for stevie to hear of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0231.mp3|she told her husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0232.mp3|it only excited the poor boy because he could not help them being so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0233.mp3|nobody could|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0234.mp3|it was in the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0235.mp3|mister verloc made no comment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0236.mp3|he made no retort and yet the retort was obvious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0237.mp3|but he refrained from pointing out to his wife that the idea of making stevie the companion of his walks was her own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0238.mp3|and nobody else's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0239.mp3|at that moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0240.mp3|to an impartial observer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0241.mp3|mister verloc would have appeared more than human in his magnanimity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0242.mp3|he took down a small cardboard box from a shelf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0244.mp3|and put it down gently on the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0245.mp3|not till that was done did he break the silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0246.mp3|to the effect that most likely stevie would profit greatly by being sent out of town for a while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0247.mp3|only he supposed his wife could not get on without him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0248.mp3|could not get on without him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0250.mp3|i couldn't get on without him if it were for his good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0251.mp3|the idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0252.mp3|of course i can get on without him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0253.mp3|but there's nowhere for him to go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0255.mp3|and meanwhile he muttered that michaelis was living in a little cottage in the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0257.mp3|there were no visitors and no talk there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0258.mp3|michaelis was writing a book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0261.mp3|nasty old man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0263.mp3|as to stevie he could be no other than very pleased|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0265.mp3|he seemed to like the boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0266.mp3|well the boy was a good boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0267.mp3|you too seem to have grown quite fond of him of late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0269.mp3|mister verloc tying up the cardboard box into a parcel for the post|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0270.mp3|broke the string by an injudicious jerk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0271.mp3|and muttered several swear words confidentially to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0273.mp3|he announced his willingness to take stevie into the country himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0274.mp3|and leave him all safe with michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0275.mp3|he carried out this scheme on the very next day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0276.mp3|stevie offered no objection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0277.mp3|he seemed rather eager in a bewildered sort of way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0279.mp3|especially when his sister was not looking at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0280.mp3|his expression was proud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0282.mp3|and concentrated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0283.mp3|like that of a small child entrusted for the first time with a box of matches and the permission to strike a light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0286.mp3|recommended him not to dirty his clothes unduly in the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0287.mp3|at this stevie gave his sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0288.mp3|guardian and protector a look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0289.mp3|which for the first time in his life seemed to lack the quality of perfect childlike trustfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0290.mp3|it was haughtily gloomy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0293.mp3|you needn't be offended|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0294.mp3|you know you do get yourself very untidy when you get a chance stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0295.mp3|mister verloc was already gone some way down the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0296.mp3|thus in consequence of her mother's heroic proceedings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0299.mp3|but in the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0300.mp3|for mister verloc had to take his walks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0301.mp3|she was alone longer than usual on the day of the attempted bomb outrage in greenwich park|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0302.mp3|because mister verloc went out very early that morning and did not come back till nearly dusk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0303.mp3|she did not mind being alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0304.mp3|she had no desire to go out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0305.mp3|the weather was too bad and the shop was cosier than the streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0306.mp3|sitting behind the counter with some sewing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0307.mp3|she did not raise her eyes from her work when mister verloc entered in the aggressive clatter of the bell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0309.mp3|she did not raise her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0310.mp3|but as mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0312.mp3|and with his hat rammed down upon his forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0313.mp3|made straight for the parlour door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0314.mp3|she said serenely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0315.mp3|what a wretched day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0316.mp3|you've been perhaps to see stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0319.mp3|said mister verloc softly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0322.mp3|with her work dropped in her lap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0323.mp3|before she put it away under the counter and got up to light the gas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0324.mp3|this done she went into the parlour on her way to the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0325.mp3|mister verloc would want his tea presently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0326.mp3|confident of the power of her charms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0328.mp3|vain and antiquated forms at best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0329.mp3|probably never very exactly observed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0330.mp3|discarded nowadays even in the highest spheres|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0331.mp3|and always foreign to the standards of her class|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0332.mp3|she did not look for courtesies from him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0333.mp3|but he was a good husband and she had a loyal respect for his rights|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0335.mp3|but a slight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0337.mp3|and rapid rattling sound grew upon her hearing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0339.mp3|then as its character became plain to the ear she stopped short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0340.mp3|amazed and concerned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0341.mp3|striking a match on the box she held in her hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0342.mp3|she turned on and lighted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0343.mp3|above the parlour table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0344.mp3|one of the two gas burners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0346.mp3|being defective|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0347.mp3|first whistled as if astonished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0349.mp3|mister verloc against his usual practice had thrown off his overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0350.mp3|it was lying on the sofa|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0351.mp3|his hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0352.mp3|which he must also have thrown off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0353.mp3|rested overturned under the edge of the sofa|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0355.mp3|and his feet planted inside the fender|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0356.mp3|his head held between his hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0357.mp3|he was hanging low over the glowing grate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0358.mp3|his teeth rattled with an ungovernable violence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0359.mp3|causing his whole enormous back to tremble at the same rate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0361.mp3|you've been getting wet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0362.mp3|she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0363.mp3|not very|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0364.mp3|mister verloc managed to falter out in a profound shudder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0366.mp3|i'll have you laid up on my hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0367.mp3|she said with genuine uneasiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0368.mp3|i don't think so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0369.mp3|remarked mister verloc snuffling huskily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0370.mp3|he had certainly contrived somehow to catch an abominable cold between seven in the morning and five in the afternoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0372.mp3|where have you been to day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0373.mp3|she asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0375.mp3|answered mister verloc in a low choked nasal tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0376.mp3|his attitude suggested aggrieved sulks or a severe headache|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0377.mp3|the unsufficiency and uncandidness of his answer became painfully apparent in the dead silence of the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0378.mp3|he snuffled apologetically and added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0379.mp3|i've been to the bank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0381.mp3|you have|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0382.mp3|she said dispassionately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0384.mp3|mister verloc mumbled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0385.mp3|with his nose over the grate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0386.mp3|and with marked unwillingness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0387.mp3|draw the money out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0389.mp3|all of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0390.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0393.mp3|got two knives and two forks out of the table drawer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0394.mp3|and suddenly stopped in her methodical proceedings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0395.mp3|what did you do that for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0396.mp3|may want it soon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0397.mp3|snuffled vaguely mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0398.mp3|who was coming to the end of his calculated indiscretions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0399.mp3|i don't know what you mean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0400.mp3|remarked his wife in a tone perfectly casual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0401.mp3|but standing stock still between the table and the cupboard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0402.mp3|you know you can trust me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0405.mp3|saying with deliberation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0406.mp3|oh yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0409.mp3|she laid two plates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0410.mp3|got the bread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0411.mp3|the butter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0412.mp3|going to and fro quietly between the table and the cupboard in the peace and silence of her home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0413.mp3|on the point of taking out the jam she reflected practically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0414.mp3|he will be feeling hungry having been away all day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0415.mp3|and she returned to the cupboard once more to get the cold beef|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0417.mp3|and with a passing glance at her motionless husband hugging the fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0418.mp3|she went down two steps into the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0419.mp3|it was only when coming back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0420.mp3|carving knife and fork in hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0421.mp3|that she spoke again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0422.mp3|if i hadn't trusted you i wouldn't have married you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0424.mp3|mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0425.mp3|holding his head in both hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0426.mp3|seemed to have gone to sleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0428.mp3|adolf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0429.mp3|mister verloc got up at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0430.mp3|and staggered a little before he sat down at the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0431.mp3|his wife examining the sharp edge of the carving knife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0432.mp3|placed it on the dish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0435.mp3|you should feed your cold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0437.mp3|he looked up and shook his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0438.mp3|his eyes were bloodshot and his face red|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0439.mp3|his fingers had ruffled his hair into a dissipated untidiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0440.mp3|altogether he had a disreputable aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0441.mp3|expressive of the discomfort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0442.mp3|the irritation and the gloom following a heavy debauch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0443.mp3|but mister verloc was not a debauched man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0444.mp3|in his conduct he was respectable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0445.mp3|his appearance might have been the effect of a feverish cold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0446.mp3|he drank three cups of tea but abstained from food entirely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0448.mp3|who said at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0449.mp3|aren't your feet wet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0450.mp3|you had better put on your slippers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0451.mp3|you aren't going out any more this evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0452.mp3|mister verloc intimated by morose grunts and signs that his feet were not wet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0453.mp3|and that anyhow he did not care|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0455.mp3|but the question of going out in the evening received an unexpected development|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0456.mp3|it was not of going out in the evening that mister verloc was thinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0457.mp3|his thoughts embraced a vaster scheme|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0458.mp3|from moody and incomplete phrases it became apparent that mister verloc had been considering the expediency of emigrating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0459.mp3|it was not very clear whether he had in his mind france or california|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0460.mp3|the utter unexpectedness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0461.mp3|improbability|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0462.mp3|and inconceivableness of such an event robbed this vague declaration of all its effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0464.mp3|as placidly as if her husband had been threatening her with the end of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0465.mp3|said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0466.mp3|the idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0467.mp3|mister verloc declared himself sick and tired of everything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0468.mp3|and besides she interrupted him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0470.mp3|it was indeed obvious that mister verloc was not in his usual state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0471.mp3|physically and even mentally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0472.mp3|a sombre irresolution held him silent for a while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0473.mp3|then he murmured a few ominous generalities on the theme of necessity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0475.mp3|repeated winnie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0476.mp3|sitting calmly back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0477.mp3|with folded arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0478.mp3|opposite her husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0479.mp3|i should like to know who's to make you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0480.mp3|you ain't a slave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0481.mp3|no one need be a slave in this country and don't you make yourself one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0482.mp3|she paused and with invincible and steady candour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0483.mp3|the business isn't so bad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0484.mp3|she went on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0485.mp3|you've a comfortable home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0486.mp3|she glanced all round the parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0487.mp3|from the corner cupboard to the good fire in the grate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0488.mp3|ensconced cosily behind the shop of doubtful wares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0489.mp3|with the mysteriously dim window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0491.mp3|it was in all essentials of domestic propriety and domestic comfort a respectable home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0492.mp3|her devoted affection missed out of it her brother stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0494.mp3|she missed him poignantly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0495.mp3|with all the force of her protecting passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0496.mp3|this was the boy's home too the roof the cupboard the stoked grate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0498.mp3|and walking to the other end of the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0499.mp3|said in the fulness of her heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0500.mp3|and you are not tired of me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0501.mp3|mister verloc made no sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0503.mp3|and pressed her lips to his forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0504.mp3|thus she lingered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0505.mp3|not a whisper reached them from the outside world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0506.mp3|the sound of footsteps on the pavement died out in the discreet dimness of the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0507.mp3|only the gas jet above the table went on purring equably in the brooding silence of the parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0508.mp3|during the contact of that unexpected and lingering kiss mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0509.mp3|gripping with both hands the edges of his chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0511.mp3|when the pressure was removed he let go the chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0513.mp3|and went to stand before the fireplace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0514.mp3|he turned no longer his back to the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0515.mp3|with his features swollen and an air of being drugged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0516.mp3|he followed his wife's movements with his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0518.mp3|her tranquil voice commented the idea thrown out in a reasonable and domestic tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0519.mp3|it wouldn't stand examination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0520.mp3|she condemned it from every point of view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0521.mp3|but her only real concern was stevie's welfare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0522.mp3|he appeared to her thought in that connection as sufficiently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0524.mp3|not to be taken rashly abroad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0525.mp3|and that was all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0526.mp3|but talking round that vital point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0527.mp3|she approached absolute vehemence in her delivery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0528.mp3|meanwhile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0530.mp3|she arrayed herself in an apron for the washing up of cups|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0531.mp3|and as if excited by the sound of her uncontradicted voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0532.mp3|she went so far as to say in a tone almost tart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0533.mp3|if you go abroad you'll have to go without me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0534.mp3|you know i wouldn't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0535.mp3|said mister verloc huskily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0538.mp3|they had sounded more unkind than she meant them to be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0539.mp3|they had also the unwisdom of unnecessary things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0540.mp3|in fact she had not meant them at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0541.mp3|it was a sort of phrase that is suggested by the demon of perverse inspiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0542.mp3|but she knew a way to make it as if it had not been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0545.mp3|half cruel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0547.mp3|because of her respectability and her ignorance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0548.mp3|but the man was her husband now and she was no longer ignorant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0549.mp3|she kept it on him for a whole second|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0550.mp3|with her grave face motionless like a mask|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0551.mp3|while she said playfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0553.mp3|you would miss me too much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0554.mp3|mister verloc started forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0556.mp3|he said in a louder tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0557.mp3|throwing his arms out and making a step towards her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0558.mp3|something wild and doubtful in his expression made it appear uncertain whether he meant to strangle or to embrace his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0561.mp3|you go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0562.mp3|he stopped his arms came down slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0563.mp3|you go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0565.mp3|i've got my apron on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0566.mp3|mister verloc obeyed woodenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0568.mp3|and like an automaton whose face had been painted red|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0569.mp3|and this resemblance to a mechanical figure went so far that he had an automaton's absurd air of being aware of the machinery inside of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0570.mp3|he closed the parlour door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0572.mp3|carried the tray into the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0573.mp3|she washed the cups and some other things before she stopped in her work to listen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0574.mp3|no sound reached her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0575.mp3|the customer was a long time in the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0576.mp3|it was a customer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0577.mp3|because if he had not been mister verloc would have taken him inside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0578.mp3|undoing the strings of her apron with a jerk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0579.mp3|she threw it on a chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0580.mp3|and walked back to the parlour slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0581.mp3|at that precise moment mister verloc entered from the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0582.mp3|he had gone in red|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0583.mp3|he came out a strange papery white|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0586.mp3|feverish stupor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0588.mp3|he walked straight to the sofa|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0589.mp3|and stood looking down at his overcoat lying there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0590.mp3|as though he were afraid to touch it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0591.mp3|what's the matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0594.mp3|i find i'll have to go out this evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0595.mp3|said mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0596.mp3|he did not attempt to pick up his outer garment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0598.mp3|and shutting the door after her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0599.mp3|walked in behind the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0600.mp3|she did not look overtly at the customer till she had established herself comfortably on the chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0601.mp3|but by that time she had noted that he was tall and thin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0602.mp3|and wore his moustaches twisted up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0603.mp3|in fact he gave the sharp points a twist just then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0605.mp3|he was a little splashed a little wet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0606.mp3|a dark man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0607.mp3|with the ridge of the cheek bone well defined under the slightly hollow temple|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0608.mp3|a complete stranger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0609.mp3|not a customer either|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0611.mp3|you came over from the continent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0612.mp3|she said after a time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0614.mp3|thin stranger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0616.mp3|answered only by a faint and peculiar smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0618.mp3|you understand english don't you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0619.mp3|oh yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0620.mp3|i understand english|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0621.mp3|there was nothing foreign in his accent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0622.mp3|except that he seemed in his slow enunciation to be taking pains with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0624.mp3|in her varied experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0625.mp3|had come to the conclusion that some foreigners could speak better english than the natives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0626.mp3|she said looking at the door of the parlour fixedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0628.mp3|the stranger gave her again a silent smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0629.mp3|he had a kindly mouth and probing eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0630.mp3|and he shook his head a little sadly it seemed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0631.mp3|my husband will see you through all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0633.mp3|continental hotel it's called|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0635.mp3|it's quiet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0636.mp3|my husband will take you there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0637.mp3|a good idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0638.mp3|said the thin dark man whose glance had hardened suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0640.mp3|perhaps in france|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0641.mp3|i have heard of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0642.mp3|admitted the visitor in his slow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0643.mp3|painstaking tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0644.mp3|which yet had a certain curtness of intention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0645.mp3|there was a pause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0646.mp3|then he spoke again in a far less elaborate manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0647.mp3|your husband has not gone out to wait for me in the street by chance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0650.mp3|he couldn't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0651.mp3|there's no other door to the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0652.mp3|for a moment she sat impassive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0653.mp3|then left her seat to go and peep through the glazed door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0654.mp3|suddenly she opened it and disappeared into the parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0655.mp3|mister verloc had done no more than put on his overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0656.mp3|but why he should remain afterwards leaning over the table propped up on his two arms as though he were feeling giddy or sick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0657.mp3|she could not understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0659.mp3|she called out half aloud and when he had raised himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0660.mp3|do you know that man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0661.mp3|she asked rapidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0662.mp3|i've heard of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0669.mp3|protested mister verloc busy fishing for his hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0670.mp3|but when he got it from under the sofa he held it as if he did not know the use of a hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0671.mp3|well he's waiting for you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0676.mp3|bothered with embassy people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0677.mp3|repeated mister verloc with a heavy start of surprise and fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0678.mp3|who's been talking to you of the embassy people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0679.mp3|yourself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0680.mp3|talked of the embassy to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0681.mp3|mister verloc seemed scared and bewildered beyond measure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0682.mp3|his wife explained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0684.mp3|what what did i say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0685.mp3|what do you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0687.mp3|it seemed mostly nonsense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0688.mp3|enough to let me guess that something worried you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0689.mp3|mister verloc rammed his hat on his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0690.mp3|a crimson flood of anger ran over his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0692.mp3|the embassy people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0693.mp3|i would cut their hearts out one after another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0694.mp3|but let them look out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0696.mp3|he fumed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0697.mp3|pacing up and down between the table and the sofa|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0698.mp3|his open overcoat catching against the angles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0699.mp3|the red flood of anger ebbed out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0700.mp3|and left his face all white|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0701.mp3|with quivering nostrils|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0703.mp3|for the purposes of practical existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0704.mp3|put down these appearances to the cold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0705.mp3|well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0706.mp3|she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0710.mp3|and come back home to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0712.mp3|mister verloc calmed down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0714.mp3|with resolution imprinted on his pale face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0715.mp3|had already opened the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0716.mp3|when his wife called him back in a whisper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0719.mp3|he came back startled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0720.mp3|what about that money you drew out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0721.mp3|she asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0722.mp3|you've got it in your pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0723.mp3|hadn't you better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0724.mp3|mister verloc gazed stupidly into the palm of his wife's extended hand for some time before he slapped his brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0726.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0727.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0728.mp3|i didn't know what you meant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0729.mp3|he drew out of his breast pocket a new pigskin pocket book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0731.mp3|and stood still till the bell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0734.mp3|only then she peeped in at the amount|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0735.mp3|drawing the notes out for the purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0736.mp3|after this inspection she looked round thoughtfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0737.mp3|with an air of mistrust in the silence and solitude of the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0738.mp3|this abode of her married life appeared to her as lonely and unsafe as though it had been situated in the midst of a forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0739.mp3|no receptacle she could think of amongst the solid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0741.mp3|it was an ideal conception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0742.mp3|endowed with sublime faculties and a miraculous insight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0743.mp3|the till was not to be thought of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0747.mp3|having thus disposed of her husband's capital|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0748.mp3|she was rather glad to hear the clatter of the door bell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0749.mp3|announcing an arrival|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0750.mp3|assuming the fixed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0751.mp3|unabashed stare and the stony expression reserved for the casual customer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0752.mp3|she walked in behind the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0753.mp3|a man standing in the middle of the shop was inspecting it with a swift|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0755.mp3|all round glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0756.mp3|his eyes ran over the walls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0757.mp3|took in the ceiling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0758.mp3|noted the floor all in a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0760.mp3|he smiled the smile of an old if distant acquaintance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0762.mp3|not a customer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0765.mp3|to mere indifference and faced him across the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0766.mp3|he approached on his side confidentially but not too markedly so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0768.mp3|he asked in an easy full tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0769.mp3|no he's gone out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0771.mp3|i've called to get from him a little private information|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0772.mp3|this was the exact truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0773.mp3|chief inspector heat had been all the way home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0774.mp3|and had even gone so far as to think of getting into his slippers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0775.mp3|since practically he was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0776.mp3|he told himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0777.mp3|chucked out of that case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0778.mp3|he indulged in some scornful and in a few angry thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0779.mp3|and found the occupation so unsatisfactory that he resolved to seek relief out of doors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0780.mp3|nothing prevented him paying a friendly call to mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0781.mp3|casually as it were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0782.mp3|it was in the character of a private citizen that walking out privately he made use of his customary conveyances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0784.mp3|chief inspector heat respected his own private character so consistently that he took especial pains to avoid all the police constables on point and patrol duty in the vicinity of brett street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0785.mp3|this precaution was much more necessary for a man of his standing than for an obscure assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0786.mp3|private citizen heat entered the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0788.mp3|the piece of cloth picked up in greenwich was in his pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0789.mp3|not that he had the slightest intention of producing it in his private capacity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0790.mp3|on the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0791.mp3|he wanted to know just what mister verloc would be disposed to say voluntarily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0793.mp3|it was a conscientiously professional hope in the main|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0794.mp3|but not without its moral value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0795.mp3|for chief inspector heat was a servant of justice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0796.mp3|finding mister verloc from home he felt disappointed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0798.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0800.mp3|the information i need is quite private|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0801.mp3|he repeated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0802.mp3|you understand what i mean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0803.mp3|i wonder if you could give me a notion where he's gone to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0806.mp3|she turned away to range some boxes on the shelves behind the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0807.mp3|chief inspector heat looked at her thoughtfully for a time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0808.mp3|i suppose you know who i am|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0809.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0811.mp3|chief inspector heat was amazed at her coolness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0813.mp3|you know i am in the police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0814.mp3|he said sharply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0815.mp3|i don't trouble my head much about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0817.mp3|my name is heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0820.mp3|and turning round|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0821.mp3|faced him again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0822.mp3|heavy eyed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0823.mp3|with idle hands hanging down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0824.mp3|a silence reigned for a time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0825.mp3|so your husband went out a quarter of an hour ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0826.mp3|and he didn't say when he would be back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0827.mp3|he didn't go out alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0829.mp3|a friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0831.mp3|it was in perfect order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0832.mp3|a stranger who called|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0834.mp3|what sort of man was that stranger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0835.mp3|would you mind telling me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0837.mp3|and when chief inspector heat heard of a man dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0839.mp3|with a long face and turned up moustaches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0840.mp3|he gave signs of perturbation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0841.mp3|and exclaimed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0842.mp3|dash me if i didn't think so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0843.mp3|he hasn't lost any time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0844.mp3|he was intensely disgusted in the secrecy of his heart at the unofficial conduct of his immediate chief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0845.mp3|but he was not quixotic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0847.mp3|what they had gone out for he did not know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0848.mp3|but he imagined it possible that they would return together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0850.mp3|it's being tampered with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0851.mp3|he thought bitterly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0852.mp3|i am afraid i haven't time to wait for your husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0853.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0855.mp3|her detachment had impressed chief inspector heat all along|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0857.mp3|chief inspector heat hung in the wind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0858.mp3|swayed by his passions like the most private of citizens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0859.mp3|i think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0860.mp3|he said looking at her steadily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0861.mp3|that you could give me a pretty good notion of what's going on if you liked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0863.mp3|going on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0864.mp3|what is going on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0865.mp3|why the affair i came to talk about a little with your husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0867.mp3|but she had not stirred out of doors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0868.mp3|the newsboys never invaded brett street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0869.mp3|it was not a street for their business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0870.mp3|and the echo of their cries drifting along the populous thoroughfares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0871.mp3|expired between the dirty brick walls without reaching the threshold of the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0872.mp3|her husband had not brought an evening paper home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0873.mp3|at any rate she had not seen it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0875.mp3|and she said so with a genuine note of wonder in her quiet voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0876.mp3|chief inspector heat did not believe for a moment in so much ignorance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0877.mp3|curtly without amiability he stated the bare fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0879.mp3|i call it silly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0880.mp3|she pronounced slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0881.mp3|she paused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0883.mp3|the chief inspector waited watchfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0884.mp3|nothing more came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0885.mp3|and your husband didn't mention anything to you when he came home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0887.mp3|a languid baffling silence reigned in the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0889.mp3|there was another small matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0890.mp3|he began in a detached tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0891.mp3|which i wanted to speak to your husband about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0894.mp3|with her mind specially aware of thieves that evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0895.mp3|touched lightly the bosom of her dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0896.mp3|we have lost no overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0897.mp3|she said calmly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0899.mp3|continued private citizen heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0901.mp3|he took up a small bottle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0902.mp3|and looked at it against the gas jet in the middle of the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0903.mp3|purple isn't it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0904.mp3|he remarked setting it down again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0909.mp3|where's your brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0910.mp3|can i see him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0911.mp3|asked the chief inspector briskly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0913.mp3|no he isn't here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0914.mp3|i wrote that label myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0915.mp3|where's your brother now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0916.mp3|he's been away living with a friend in the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0917.mp3|the overcoat comes from the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0918.mp3|and what's the name of the friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0919.mp3|michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0921.mp3|the chief inspector let out a whistle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0922.mp3|his eyes snapped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0924.mp3|capital|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0926.mp3|oh no|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0928.mp3|that must be the thief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0930.mp3|good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0931.mp3|said the chief inspector in an approving tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0934.mp3|stared at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0935.mp3|he sought for information|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0939.mp3|absent minded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0940.mp3|peculiar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0941.mp3|and also that the woman who was speaking to him had had the charge of that boy since he was a baby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0942.mp3|easily excitable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0943.mp3|he suggested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0944.mp3|oh yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0946.mp3|but how did he come to lose his coat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0947.mp3|chief inspector heat suddenly pulled out a pink newspaper he had bought less than half an hour ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0948.mp3|he was interested in horses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0949.mp3|forced by his calling into an attitude of doubt and suspicion towards his fellow citizens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0952.mp3|he plunged his hand again into his pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0953.mp3|and pulling out the piece of cloth fate had presented him with out of a heap of things that seemed to have been collected in shambles and rag shops|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0956.mp3|she took it mechanically in both her hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0957.mp3|her eyes seemed to grow bigger as she looked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0959.mp3|she whispered then raised her head and staggered backward a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0962.mp3|and she sat heavily on the chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0964.mp3|and in that moment he had a glimpse into the whole amazing truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0968.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0971.mp3|what was the connection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0972.mp3|and she became so rigid all over that she was not able to turn her head at the clatter of the bell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0973.mp3|which caused the private investigator heat to spin round on his heel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0975.mp3|and for a moment the two men looked at each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0977.mp3|without looking at his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0978.mp3|walked up to the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0979.mp3|who was relieved to see him return alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0981.mp3|muttered mister verloc heavily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0982.mp3|who are you after|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0983.mp3|no one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0984.mp3|said chief inspector heat in a low tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0985.mp3|look here i would like a word or two with you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0986.mp3|mister verloc still pale had brought an air of resolution with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0987.mp3|still he didn't look at his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0988.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0989.mp3|come in here then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0990.mp3|and he led the way into the parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0992.mp3|jumping up from the chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0993.mp3|ran to it as if to fling it open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0994.mp3|but instead of doing so fell on her knees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0995.mp3|with her ear to the keyhole|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0996.mp3|the two men must have stopped directly they were through|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0997.mp3|because she heard plainly the chief inspector's voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_0998.mp3|though she could not see his finger pressed against her husband's breast emphatically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1000.mp3|two men were seen entering the park|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1001.mp3|and the voice of mister verloc said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1002.mp3|well take me now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1003.mp3|what's to prevent you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1004.mp3|you have the right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1006.mp3|i know too well who you have been giving yourself away to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1008.mp3|but don't you make a mistake it's i who found you out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1009.mp3|then she heard only muttering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1011.mp3|because stevie's sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1014.mp3|i never noticed that she had hit upon that dodge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1016.mp3|whose mysteriousness was less nightmarish to her brain than the horrible suggestions of shaped words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1017.mp3|then chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1018.mp3|on the other side of the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1019.mp3|raised his voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1020.mp3|you must have been mad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1022.mp3|i have been mad for a month or more but i am not mad now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1023.mp3|it's all over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1024.mp3|it shall all come out of my head and hang the consequences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1025.mp3|there was a silence and then private citizen heat murmured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1026.mp3|what's coming out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1028.mp3|exclaimed the voice of mister verloc and then sank very low|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1029.mp3|after a while it rose again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1030.mp3|you have known me for several years now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1033.mp3|you know i was a straight man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1034.mp3|yes straight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1035.mp3|this appeal to old acquaintance must have been extremely distasteful to the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1036.mp3|his voice took on a warning note|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1037.mp3|don't you trust so much to what you have been promised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1039.mp3|i don't think we will run after you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1040.mp3|mister verloc was heard to laugh a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1041.mp3|oh yes you hope the others will get rid of me for you don't you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1042.mp3|no no you don't shake me off now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1043.mp3|i have been a straight man to those people too long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1044.mp3|and now everything must come out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1045.mp3|let it come out then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1046.mp3|the indifferent voice of chief inspector heat assented|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1047.mp3|but tell me now how did you get away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1048.mp3|i was making for chesterfield walk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1050.mp3|when i heard the bang|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1051.mp3|i started running then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1053.mp3|i saw no one till i was past the end of george street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1055.mp3|so easy as that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1056.mp3|marvelled the voice of chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1057.mp3|the bang startled you eh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1058.mp3|yes it came too soon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1059.mp3|confessed the gloomy husky voice of mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1061.mp3|her lips were blue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1063.mp3|and her pale face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1064.mp3|in which the two eyes seemed like two black holes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1065.mp3|felt to her as if it were enveloped in flames|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1066.mp3|on the other side of the door the voices sank very low|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1067.mp3|she caught words now and then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1068.mp3|sometimes in her husband's voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1069.mp3|sometimes in the smooth tones of the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1070.mp3|she heard this last say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1071.mp3|we believe he stumbled against the root of a tree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1072.mp3|there was a husky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1074.mp3|which lasted for some time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1075.mp3|and then the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1076.mp3|as if answering some inquiry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1077.mp3|spoke emphatically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1079.mp3|blown to small bits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1080.mp3|limbs gravel clothing bones splinters all mixed up together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1083.mp3|and stopping her ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1084.mp3|reeled to and fro between the counter and the shelves on the wall towards the chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1085.mp3|her crazed eyes noted the sporting sheet left by the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1086.mp3|and as she knocked herself against the counter she snatched it up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1087.mp3|fell into the chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1089.mp3|rosy sheet right across in trying to open it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1090.mp3|then flung it on the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1091.mp3|on the other side of the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1092.mp3|chief inspector heat was saying to mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1093.mp3|the secret agent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1094.mp3|so your defence will be practically a full confession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1095.mp3|it will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1097.mp3|you won't be believed as much as you fancy you will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1098.mp3|and the chief inspector remained thoughtful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1099.mp3|the turn this affair was taking meant the disclosure of many things the laying waste of fields of knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1100.mp3|which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1101.mp3|cultivated by a capable man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1102.mp3|had a distinct value for the individual and for the society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1103.mp3|it was sorry sorry meddling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1104.mp3|it would leave michaelis unscathed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1105.mp3|it would drag to light the professor's home industry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1107.mp3|make no end of a row in the papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1109.mp3|from that point of view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1110.mp3|appeared to him by a sudden illumination as invariably written by fools for the reading of imbeciles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1111.mp3|mentally he agreed with the words mister verloc let fall at last in answer to his last remark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1112.mp3|perhaps not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1113.mp3|but it will upset many things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1114.mp3|i have been a straight man and i shall keep straight in this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1115.mp3|if they let you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1116.mp3|said the chief inspector cynically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1117.mp3|you will be preached to no doubt before they put you into the dock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1118.mp3|and in the end you may yet get let in for a sentence that will surprise you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1119.mp3|i wouldn't trust too much the gentleman who's been talking to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1120.mp3|mister verloc listened frowning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1121.mp3|my advice to you is to clear out while you may|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1122.mp3|i have no instructions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1123.mp3|there are some of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1124.mp3|continued chief inspector heat laying a peculiar stress on the word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1125.mp3|them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1126.mp3|who think you are already out of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1127.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1128.mp3|mister verloc was moved to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1129.mp3|though since his return from greenwich he had spent most of his time sitting in the tap room of an obscure little public house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1130.mp3|he could hardly have hoped for such favourable news|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1131.mp3|that's the impression about you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1132.mp3|the chief inspector nodded at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1137.mp3|he raised his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1138.mp3|and gazing at the closed door of the parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1139.mp3|muttered feelingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1140.mp3|i only wish you would take me away to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1141.mp3|i would go quietly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1142.mp3|i daresay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1143.mp3|assented sardonically the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1144.mp3|following the direction of his glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1145.mp3|the brow of mister verloc broke into slight moisture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1146.mp3|he lowered his husky voice confidentially before the unmoved chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1147.mp3|the lad was half witted irresponsible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1148.mp3|any court would have seen that at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1149.mp3|only fit for the asylum|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1151.mp3|the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1152.mp3|his hand on the door handle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1155.mp3|what drove you off your head like this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1158.mp3|did not hesitate in the choice of words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1160.mp3|he hissed forcibly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1162.mp3|the chief inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1163.mp3|steady eyed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1164.mp3|nodded briefly his comprehension|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1165.mp3|and opened the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1167.mp3|behind the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1168.mp3|might have heard but did not see his departure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1169.mp3|pursued by the aggressive clatter of the bell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1170.mp3|she sat at her post of duty behind the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1171.mp3|she sat rigidly erect in the chair with two dirty pink pieces of paper lying spread out at her feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1172.mp3|the palms of her hands were pressed convulsively to her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1173.mp3|with the tips of the fingers contracted against the forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1174.mp3|as though the skin had been a mask which she was ready to tear off violently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1175.mp3|the perfect immobility of her pose expressed the agitation of rage and despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1176.mp3|all the potential violence of tragic passions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1177.mp3|better than any shallow display of shrieks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1178.mp3|with the beating of a distracted head against the walls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1179.mp3|could have done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1180.mp3|chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1182.mp3|swinging pace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1183.mp3|gave her only a cursory glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1185.mp3|as if her attitude had the locking power of a spell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1187.mp3|in that shop of shady wares fitted with deal shelves painted a dull brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_09_conrad_1188.mp3|which seemed to devour the sheen of the light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0001.mp3|driven rapidly in a hansom from the neighbourhood of soho in the direction of westminster|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0002.mp3|got out at the very centre of the empire on which the sun never sets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0003.mp3|some stalwart constables|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0004.mp3|who did not seem particularly impressed by the duty of watching the august spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0005.mp3|saluted him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0006.mp3|penetrating through a portal by no means lofty into the precincts of the house which is the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0007.mp3|par excellence in the minds of many millions of men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0008.mp3|he was met at last by the volatile and revolutionary toodles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0009.mp3|that neat and nice young man concealed his astonishment at the early appearance of the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0010.mp3|whom he had been told to look out for some time about midnight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0011.mp3|his turning up so early he concluded to be the sign that things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0013.mp3|had gone wrong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0014.mp3|with an extremely ready sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0015.mp3|which in nice youngsters goes often with a joyous temperament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0016.mp3|he felt sorry for the great presence he called|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0018.mp3|and also for the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0019.mp3|whose face appeared to him more ominously wooden than ever before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0020.mp3|and quite wonderfully long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0021.mp3|what a queer foreign looking chap he is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0022.mp3|he thought to himself smiling from a distance with friendly buoyancy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0023.mp3|and directly they came together he began to talk with the kind intention of burying the awkwardness of failure under a heap of words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0024.mp3|it looked as if the great assault threatened for that night were going to fizzle out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0025.mp3|an inferior henchman of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0026.mp3|that brute cheeseman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0027.mp3|was up boring mercilessly a very thin house with some shamelessly cooked statistics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0028.mp3|he toodles hoped he would bore them into a count out every minute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0029.mp3|but then he might be only marking time to let that guzzling cheeseman dine at his leisure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0030.mp3|anyway the chief could not be persuaded to go home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0031.mp3|he will see you at once i think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0032.mp3|he's sitting all alone in his room thinking of all the fishes of the sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0033.mp3|concluded toodles airily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0034.mp3|come along|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0035.mp3|notwithstanding the kindness of his disposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0036.mp3|the young private secretary unpaid was accessible to the common failings of humanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0037.mp3|he did not wish to harrow the feelings of the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0038.mp3|who looked to him uncommonly like a man who has made a mess of his job|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0039.mp3|but his curiosity was too strong to be restrained by mere compassion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0040.mp3|he could not help|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0041.mp3|as they went along|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0042.mp3|to throw over his shoulder lightly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0043.mp3|and your sprat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0044.mp3|got him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0046.mp3|good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0047.mp3|you've no idea how these great men dislike to be disappointed in small things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0048.mp3|after this profound observation the experienced toodles seemed to reflect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0049.mp3|at any rate he said nothing for quite two seconds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0050.mp3|then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0051.mp3|i'm glad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0052.mp3|but i say is it really such a very small thing as you make it out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0053.mp3|do you know what may be done with a sprat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0054.mp3|the assistant commissioner asked in his turn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0056.mp3|chuckled toodles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0057.mp3|whose erudition on the subject of the fishing industry was fresh and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0058.mp3|in comparison with his ignorance of all other industrial matters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0059.mp3|immense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0061.mp3|the assistant commissioner interrupted the apprentice statesman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0064.mp3|but a sprat is also thrown away sometimes in order to catch a whale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0067.mp3|exclaimed toodles with bated breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0068.mp3|you're after a whale then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0069.mp3|not exactly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0070.mp3|what i am after is more like a dog fish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0072.mp3|yes i do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0074.mp3|it's a noxious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0076.mp3|altogether detestable beast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0077.mp3|with a sort of smooth face and moustaches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0078.mp3|described to a t|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0079.mp3|commended the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0080.mp3|only mine is clean shaven altogether|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0081.mp3|you've seen him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0082.mp3|it's a witty fish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0083.mp3|i have seen him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0084.mp3|said toodles incredulously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0085.mp3|i can't conceive where i could have seen him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0086.mp3|at the explorers i should say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0087.mp3|dropped the assistant commissioner calmly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0088.mp3|at the name of that extremely exclusive club toodles looked scared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0089.mp3|and stopped short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0091.mp3|he protested but in an awe struck tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0094.mp3|honorary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0095.mp3|muttered the assistant commissioner through his teeth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0097.mp3|toodles looked so thunderstruck that the assistant commissioner smiled faintly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0098.mp3|that's between ourselves strictly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0099.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0100.mp3|that's the beastliest thing i've ever heard in my life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0101.mp3|declared toodles feebly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0102.mp3|as if astonishment had robbed him of all his buoyant strength in a second|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0103.mp3|the assistant commissioner gave him an unsmiling glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0104.mp3|till they came to the door of the great man's room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0106.mp3|as though he were offended with the assistant commissioner for exposing such an unsavoury and disturbing fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0108.mp3|of its social purity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0109.mp3|toodles was revolutionary only in politics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0110.mp3|his social beliefs and personal feelings he wished to preserve unchanged through all the years allotted to him on this earth which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0111.mp3|upon the whole|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0112.mp3|he believed to be a nice place to live on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0113.mp3|he stood aside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0114.mp3|go in without knocking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0115.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0116.mp3|shades of green silk fitted low over all the lights imparted to the room something of a forest's deep gloom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0117.mp3|the haughty eyes were physically the great man's weak point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0118.mp3|this point was wrapped up in secrecy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0119.mp3|when an opportunity offered he rested them conscientiously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0120.mp3|the assistant commissioner entering saw at first only a big pale hand supporting a big head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0121.mp3|and concealing the upper part of a big pale face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0122.mp3|an open despatch box stood on the writing table near a few oblong sheets of paper and a scattered handful of quill pens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0123.mp3|there was absolutely nothing else on the large flat surface except a little bronze statuette draped in a toga|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0124.mp3|mysteriously watchful in its shadowy immobility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0125.mp3|the assistant commissioner invited to take a chair sat down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0126.mp3|in the dim light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0127.mp3|the salient points of his personality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0128.mp3|the long face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0129.mp3|the black hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0130.mp3|his lankness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0131.mp3|made him look more foreign than ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0132.mp3|the great man manifested no surprise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0133.mp3|no eagerness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0134.mp3|no sentiment whatever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0135.mp3|the attitude in which he rested his menaced eyes was profoundly meditative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0136.mp3|he did not alter it the least bit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0137.mp3|but his tone was not dreamy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0138.mp3|well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0140.mp3|you came upon something unexpected on the first step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0141.mp3|not exactly unexpected sir ethelred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0142.mp3|what i mainly came upon was a psychological state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0143.mp3|the great presence made a slight movement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0144.mp3|you must be lucid please|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0145.mp3|yes sir ethelred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0147.mp3|and they do it often to the police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0149.mp3|the man figuratively speaking flung himself on my breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0152.mp3|but he took it all in the stride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0153.mp3|the wonderfulness of it never checked him for a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0154.mp3|there remained for me only to put to him the two questions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0155.mp3|who put you up to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0156.mp3|and who was the man who did it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0157.mp3|he answered the first with remarkable emphasis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0158.mp3|as to the second question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0159.mp3|i gather that the fellow with the bomb was his brother in law quite a lad a weak minded creature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0161.mp3|what then have you learned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0162.mp3|asked the great man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0164.mp3|i've learned that the ex convict michaelis had nothing to do with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0165.mp3|though indeed the lad had been living with him temporarily in the country up to eight o'clock this morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0166.mp3|it is more than likely that michaelis knows nothing of it to this moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0167.mp3|you are positive as to that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0168.mp3|asked the great man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0169.mp3|quite certain sir ethelred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0170.mp3|this fellow verloc went there this morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0171.mp3|and took away the lad on the pretence of going out for a walk in the lanes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0172.mp3|as it was not the first time that he did this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0173.mp3|michaelis could not have the slightest suspicion of anything unusual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0176.mp3|the indignation of this man verloc had left nothing in doubt nothing whatever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0177.mp3|he had been driven out of his mind almost by an extraordinary performance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0178.mp3|which for you or me it would be difficult to take as seriously meant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0179.mp3|but which produced a great impression obviously on him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0180.mp3|the assistant commissioner then imparted briefly to the great man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0181.mp3|who sat still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0182.mp3|resting his eyes under the screen of his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0184.mp3|the assistant commissioner did not seem to refuse it a certain amount of competency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0185.mp3|but the great personage remarked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0186.mp3|all this seems very fantastic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0187.mp3|doesn't it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0188.mp3|one would think a ferocious joke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0189.mp3|but our man took it seriously it appears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0190.mp3|he felt himself threatened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0193.mp3|he was in direct communication with old stott wartenheim himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0194.mp3|and had come to regard his services as indispensable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0195.mp3|it was an extremely rude awakening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0196.mp3|i imagine that he lost his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0197.mp3|he became angry and frightened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0198.mp3|upon my word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0201.mp3|how long were you with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0202.mp3|interrupted the presence from behind his big hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0205.mp3|in a house of bad repute called continental hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0206.mp3|closeted in a room which by the by i took for the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0207.mp3|i found him under the influence of that reaction which follows the effort of crime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0208.mp3|the man cannot be defined as a hardened criminal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0209.mp3|it is obvious that he did not plan the death of that wretched lad his brother in law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0210.mp3|that was a shock to him i could see that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0211.mp3|perhaps he is a man of strong sensibilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0212.mp3|perhaps he was even fond of the lad who knows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0213.mp3|he might have hoped that the fellow would get clear away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0216.mp3|the assistant commissioner paused in his speculations to reflect for a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0218.mp3|in that last case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0219.mp3|he could hope to have his own share in the business concealed is more than i can tell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0220.mp3|he continued|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0222.mp3|and of his truly peculiar dumbness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0223.mp3|which in the old affair of fireworks on the stairs had for many years resisted entreaties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0226.mp3|and other means of investigation used by his beloved sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0227.mp3|for stevie was loyal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0228.mp3|no i can't imagine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0229.mp3|it's possible that he never thought of that at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0232.mp3|but his state of dismay suggested to me an impulsive man who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0233.mp3|after committing suicide with the notion that it would end all his troubles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0234.mp3|had discovered that it did nothing of the kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0235.mp3|the assistant commissioner gave this definition in an apologetic voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0236.mp3|but in truth there is a sort of lucidity proper to extravagant language|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0237.mp3|and the great man was not offended|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0238.mp3|a slight jerky movement of the big body half lost in the gloom of the green silk shades|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0239.mp3|of the big head leaning on the big hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0240.mp3|accompanied an intermittent stifled but powerful sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0241.mp3|the great man had laughed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0242.mp3|what have you done with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0243.mp3|the assistant commissioner answered very readily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0247.mp3|but the fellow will disappear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0249.mp3|i don't think so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0250.mp3|where could he go to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0253.mp3|he's there at his post|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0255.mp3|but even if there were no obstacles to his freedom of action he would do nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0256.mp3|at present he hasn't enough moral energy to take a resolution of any sort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0257.mp3|permit me also to point out that if i had detained him we would have been committed to a course of action on which i wished to know your precise intentions first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0258.mp3|the great personage rose heavily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0259.mp3|an imposing shadowy form in the greenish gloom of the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0260.mp3|i'll see the attorney general to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0261.mp3|and will send for you to morrow morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0262.mp3|is there anything more you'd wish to tell me now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0263.mp3|the assistant commissioner had stood up also slender and flexible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0264.mp3|i think not sir ethelred unless i were to enter into details which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0265.mp3|no no details please|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0266.mp3|the great shadowy form seemed to shrink away as if in physical dread of details|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0267.mp3|then came forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0268.mp3|expanded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0271.mp3|offering a large hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0272.mp3|and you say that this man has got a wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0273.mp3|yes sir ethelred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0274.mp3|said the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0275.mp3|pressing deferentially the extended hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0276.mp3|a genuine wife and a genuinely respectably marital relation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0277.mp3|he told me that after his interview at the embassy he would have thrown everything up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0279.mp3|and leave the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0280.mp3|only he felt certain that his wife would not even hear of going abroad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0281.mp3|nothing could be more characteristic of the respectable bond than that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0283.mp3|with a touch of grimness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0284.mp3|the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0285.mp3|whose own wife too had refused to hear of going abroad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0286.mp3|yes a genuine wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0287.mp3|and the victim was a genuine brother in law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0288.mp3|from a certain point of view we are here in the presence of a domestic drama|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0289.mp3|the assistant commissioner laughed a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0290.mp3|but the great man's thoughts seemed to have wandered far away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0291.mp3|perhaps to the questions of his country's domestic policy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0293.mp3|the assistant commissioner withdrew quietly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0294.mp3|unnoticed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0295.mp3|as if already forgotten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0296.mp3|he had his own crusading instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0297.mp3|this affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0299.mp3|in one way or another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0300.mp3|disgusted chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0301.mp3|seemed to him a providentially given starting point for a crusade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0302.mp3|he had it much at heart to begin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0303.mp3|he walked slowly home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0304.mp3|meditating that enterprise on the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0305.mp3|and thinking over mister verloc's psychology in a composite mood of repugnance and satisfaction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0306.mp3|he walked all the way home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0307.mp3|finding the drawing room dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0308.mp3|he went upstairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0309.mp3|and spent some time between the bedroom and the dressing room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0310.mp3|changing his clothes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0313.mp3|he knew he would be welcomed there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0314.mp3|on entering the smaller of the two drawing rooms he saw his wife in a small group near the piano|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0315.mp3|a youngish composer in pass of becoming famous was discoursing from a music stool to two thick men whose backs looked old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0316.mp3|and three slender women whose backs looked young|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0317.mp3|behind the screen the great lady had only two persons with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0318.mp3|a man and a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0319.mp3|who sat side by side on arm chairs at the foot of her couch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0320.mp3|she extended her hand to the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0321.mp3|i never hoped to see you here to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0323.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0324.mp3|i had no idea myself that my work would be over so soon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0325.mp3|the assistant commissioner added in a low tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0326.mp3|i am glad to tell you that michaelis is altogether clear of this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0327.mp3|the patroness of the ex convict received this assurance indignantly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0328.mp3|why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0330.mp3|not stupid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0331.mp3|interrupted the assistant commissioner contradicting deferentially|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0332.mp3|clever enough quite clever enough for that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0333.mp3|a silence fell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0334.mp3|the man at the foot of the couch had stopped speaking to the lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0335.mp3|and looked on with a faint smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0336.mp3|i don't know whether you ever met before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0337.mp3|said the great lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0339.mp3|introduced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0340.mp3|acknowledged each other's existence with punctilious and guarded courtesy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0341.mp3|he's been frightening me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0343.mp3|with an inclination of the head towards that gentleman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0344.mp3|the assistant commissioner knew the lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0345.mp3|you do not look frightened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0346.mp3|he pronounced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0347.mp3|after surveying her conscientiously with his tired and equable gaze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0348.mp3|he was thinking meantime to himself that in this house one met everybody sooner or later|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0350.mp3|because he was witty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0351.mp3|but his eyes remained serious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0352.mp3|like the eyes of convinced man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0353.mp3|well he tried to at least|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0354.mp3|amended the lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0355.mp3|force of habit perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0356.mp3|said the assistant commissioner moved by an irresistible inspiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0357.mp3|he has been threatening society with all sorts of horrors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0358.mp3|continued the lady whose enunciation was caressing and slow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0359.mp3|apropos of this explosion in greenwich park|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0360.mp3|it appears we all ought to quake in our shoes at what's coming if those people are not suppressed all over the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0361.mp3|i had no idea this was such a grave affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0363.mp3|affecting not to listen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0364.mp3|leaned towards the couch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0365.mp3|talking amiably in subdued tones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0366.mp3|but he heard the assistant commissioner say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0370.mp3|he was racially|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0372.mp3|and individually afraid of the police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0373.mp3|it was an inherited weakness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0374.mp3|altogether independent of his judgment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0375.mp3|of his reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0376.mp3|of his experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0377.mp3|he was born to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0378.mp3|but that sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0379.mp3|which resembled the irrational horror some people have of cats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0380.mp3|did not stand in the way of his immense contempt for the english police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0381.mp3|he finished the sentence addressed to the great lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0382.mp3|and turned slightly in his chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0383.mp3|you mean that we have a great experience of these people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0384.mp3|yes indeed we suffer greatly from their activity while you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0386.mp3|while you suffer their presence gladly in your midst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0387.mp3|he finished displaying a dimple on each clean shaven cheek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0388.mp3|then he added more gravely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0389.mp3|i may even say because you do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0391.mp3|and the conversation dropped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0393.mp3|directly his back was turned on the couch the assistant commissioner rose too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0394.mp3|i thought you were going to stay and take annie home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0395.mp3|said the lady patroness of michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0396.mp3|i find that i've yet a little work to do to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0397.mp3|in connection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0398.mp3|well yes in a way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0399.mp3|tell me what is it really this horror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0400.mp3|it's difficult to say what it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0402.mp3|said the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0403.mp3|he left the drawing room hurriedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0405.mp3|wrapping up his throat carefully in a large silk handkerchief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0406.mp3|behind him a footman waited holding his overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0407.mp3|another stood ready to open the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0409.mp3|and let out at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0410.mp3|after descending the front steps he stopped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0411.mp3|as if to consider the way he should take|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0412.mp3|on seeing this through the door held open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0414.mp3|it was furnished to him by an elderly man out of livery with an air of calm solicitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0415.mp3|but the match went out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0416.mp3|the footman then closed the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0418.mp3|when at last he got out of the house he saw with disgust the|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0420.mp3|still standing on the pavement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0421.mp3|can he be waiting for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0423.mp3|he saw none|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0424.mp3|a couple of carriages waited by the curbstone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0426.mp3|the horses standing perfectly still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0427.mp3|as if carved in stone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0429.mp3|without as much as a quiver stirring the white thongs of their big whips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0433.mp3|he said nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0435.mp3|this could not last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0436.mp3|rotten weather|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0437.mp3|he growled savagely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0439.mp3|said the assistant commissioner without passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0440.mp3|he remained silent for a little while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0441.mp3|we've got hold of a man called verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0442.mp3|he announced casually|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0444.mp3|did not stagger back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0445.mp3|did not change his stride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0446.mp3|but he could not prevent himself from exclaiming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0447.mp3|what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0448.mp3|the assistant commissioner did not repeat his statement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0450.mp3|he went on in the same tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0452.mp3|what makes you say that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0454.mp3|it's verloc who says that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0455.mp3|a lying dog of some sort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0457.mp3|but in his heart he was almost awed by the miraculous cleverness of the english police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0458.mp3|the change of his opinion on the subject was so violent that it made him for a moment feel slightly sick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0459.mp3|he threw away his cigar and moved on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0460.mp3|what pleased me most in this affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0461.mp3|the assistant went on talking slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0465.mp3|and that sort of of dogs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0467.mp3|but we can't very well seek them out individually|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0468.mp3|the only way is to make their employment unpleasant to their employers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0470.mp3|and dangerous too for us here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0472.mp3|what do you mean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0473.mp3|the prosecution of this verloc will demonstrate to the public both the danger and the indecency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0474.mp3|nobody will believe what a man of that sort says|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0476.mp3|the wealth and precision of detail will carry conviction to the great mass of the public|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0477.mp3|advanced the assistant commissioner gently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0478.mp3|so that is seriously what you mean to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0479.mp3|we've got the man we have no choice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0482.mp3|what do you want to make a scandal for from morality or what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0484.mp3|the assistant commissioner having ascertained in this way that there must be some truth in the summary statements of mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0485.mp3|said indifferently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0486.mp3|there's a practical side too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0487.mp3|we have really enough to do to look after the genuine article|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0488.mp3|you can't say we are not effective|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0489.mp3|but we don't intend to let ourselves be bothered by shams under any pretext whatever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0492.mp3|it is selfish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0493.mp3|my sentiments for my own country cannot be doubted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0494.mp3|but i've always felt that we ought to be good europeans besides i mean governments and men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0495.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0496.mp3|said the assistant commissioner simply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0497.mp3|only you look at europe from its other end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0498.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0499.mp3|he went on in a good natured tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0500.mp3|the foreign governments cannot complain of the inefficiency of our police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0501.mp3|look at this outrage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0502.mp3|a case specially difficult to trace inasmuch as it was a sham|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0503.mp3|in less than twelve hours we have established the identity of a man literally blown to shreds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0505.mp3|and have had a glimpse of the inciter behind him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0506.mp3|and we could have gone further|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0508.mp3|so this instructive crime was planned abroad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0510.mp3|you admit it was planned abroad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0511.mp3|theoretically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0512.mp3|theoretically only on foreign territory abroad only by a fiction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0513.mp3|said the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0514.mp3|alluding to the character of embassies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0515.mp3|which are supposed to be part and parcel of the country to which they belong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0516.mp3|but that's a detail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0517.mp3|i talked to you of this business because it's your government that grumbles most at our police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0518.mp3|you see that we are not so bad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0519.mp3|i wanted particularly to tell you of our success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0520.mp3|i'm sure i'm very grateful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0522.mp3|we can put our finger on every anarchist here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0523.mp3|went on the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0524.mp3|as though he were quoting chief inspector heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0525.mp3|all that's wanted now is to do away with the agent provocateur to make everything safe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0527.mp3|you're not going in here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0528.mp3|remarked the assistant commissioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0529.mp3|looking at a building of noble proportions and hospitable aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0530.mp3|with the light of a great hall falling through its glass doors on a broad flight of steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0534.mp3|inside the hansom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0535.mp3|drove off without a word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0536.mp3|the assistant commissioner himself did not turn into the noble building|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0539.mp3|honorary member|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0540.mp3|would not be seen very often there in the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0541.mp3|he looked at his watch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0542.mp3|it was only half past ten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_10_conrad_0543.mp3|he had had a very full evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0000.mp3|after chief inspector heat had left him mister verloc moved about the parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0001.mp3|from time to time he eyed his wife through the open door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0002.mp3|she knows all about it now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0003.mp3|he thought to himself with commiseration for her sorrow and with some satisfaction as regarded himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0004.mp3|mister verloc's soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0005.mp3|if lacking greatness perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0006.mp3|was capable of tender sentiments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0007.mp3|the prospect of having to break the news to her had put him into a fever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0008.mp3|chief inspector heat had relieved him of the task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0009.mp3|that was good as far as it went|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0010.mp3|it remained for him now to face her grief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0011.mp3|mister verloc had never expected to have to face it on account of death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0012.mp3|whose catastrophic character cannot be argued away by sophisticated reasoning or persuasive eloquence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0013.mp3|mister verloc never meant stevie to perish with such abrupt violence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0014.mp3|he did not mean him to perish at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0015.mp3|stevie dead was a much greater nuisance than ever he had been when alive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0016.mp3|mister verloc had augured a favourable issue to his enterprise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0017.mp3|basing himself not on stevie's intelligence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0018.mp3|which sometimes plays queer tricks with a man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0019.mp3|but on the blind docility and on the blind devotion of the boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0020.mp3|though not much of a psychologist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0021.mp3|mister verloc had gauged the depth of stevie's fanaticism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0023.mp3|taking the way shown to him several times previously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0024.mp3|and rejoining his brother in law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0025.mp3|the wise and good mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0027.mp3|fifteen minutes ought to have been enough for the veriest fool to deposit the engine and walk away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0028.mp3|and the professor had guaranteed more than fifteen minutes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0029.mp3|but stevie had stumbled within five minutes of being left to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0030.mp3|and mister verloc was shaken morally to pieces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0031.mp3|he had foreseen everything but that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0032.mp3|he had foreseen stevie distracted and lost sought for found in some police station or provincial workhouse in the end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0033.mp3|he had foreseen stevie arrested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0034.mp3|and was not afraid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0035.mp3|because mister verloc had a great opinion of stevie's loyalty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0036.mp3|which had been carefully indoctrinated with the necessity of silence in the course of many walks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0038.mp3|mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0039.mp3|strolling along the streets of london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0040.mp3|had modified stevie's view of the police by conversations full of subtle reasonings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0041.mp3|never had a sage a more attentive and admiring disciple|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0043.mp3|in any case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0044.mp3|he had not foreseen the swift bringing home of his connection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0046.mp3|one can't think of everything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0047.mp3|that was what she meant when she said that he need not worry if he lost stevie during their walks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0048.mp3|she had assured him that the boy would turn up all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0050.mp3|well well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0051.mp3|muttered mister verloc in his wonder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0052.mp3|what did she mean by it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0053.mp3|spare him the trouble of keeping an anxious eye on stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0054.mp3|most likely she had meant well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0055.mp3|only she ought to have told him of the precaution she had taken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0056.mp3|mister verloc walked behind the counter of the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0057.mp3|his intention was not to overwhelm his wife with bitter reproaches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0058.mp3|mister verloc felt no bitterness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0059.mp3|the unexpected march of events had converted him to the doctrine of fatalism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0060.mp3|nothing could be helped now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0061.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0062.mp3|i didn't mean any harm to come to the boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0064.mp3|she did not uncover her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0066.mp3|persistent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0067.mp3|undiscerning glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0068.mp3|the torn evening paper was lying at her feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0069.mp3|it could not have told her much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0070.mp3|mister verloc felt the need of talking to his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0072.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0073.mp3|he upset you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0074.mp3|he's a brute blurting it out like this to a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0075.mp3|i made myself ill thinking how to break it to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0078.mp3|mister verloc the secret agent was speaking the truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0079.mp3|it was his marital affection that had received the greatest shock from the premature explosion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0080.mp3|he added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0081.mp3|i didn't feel particularly gay sitting there and thinking of you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0082.mp3|he observed another slight shudder of his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0083.mp3|which affected his sensibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0084.mp3|as she persisted in hiding her face in her hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0085.mp3|he thought he had better leave her alone for a while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0086.mp3|on this delicate impulse mister verloc withdrew into the parlour again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0089.mp3|he noticed all these things now for the first time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0090.mp3|and cutting himself a piece of bread and meat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0091.mp3|began to eat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0092.mp3|his appetite did not proceed from callousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0093.mp3|mister verloc had not eaten any breakfast that day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0094.mp3|he had left his home fasting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0095.mp3|not being an energetic man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0096.mp3|he found his resolution in nervous excitement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0097.mp3|which seemed to hold him mainly by the throat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0098.mp3|he could not have swallowed anything solid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0100.mp3|the ticket of leave apostle lived on a little milk and crusts of stale bread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0102.mp3|when mister verloc arrived he had already gone upstairs after his frugal meal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0103.mp3|absorbed in the toil and delight of literary composition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0108.mp3|mister verloc did not wait for an answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0109.mp3|but had marched out of the cottage at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0110.mp3|followed by the obedient stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0111.mp3|now that all action was over and his fate taken out of his hands with unexpected swiftness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0112.mp3|mister verloc felt terribly empty physically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0113.mp3|he carved the meat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0114.mp3|cut the bread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0115.mp3|and devoured his supper standing by the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0116.mp3|and now and then casting a glance towards his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0118.mp3|he walked again into the shop and came up very close to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0119.mp3|this sorrow with a veiled face made mister verloc uneasy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0122.mp3|his wife to be very much upset|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0123.mp3|but he wanted her to pull herself together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0125.mp3|can't be helped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0126.mp3|he said in a tone of gloomy sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0127.mp3|come winnie we've got to think of to morrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0128.mp3|you'll want all your wits about you after i am taken away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0129.mp3|he paused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0132.mp3|in whose view the newly created situation required from the two people most concerned in it calmness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0133.mp3|decision|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0134.mp3|and other qualities incompatible with the mental disorder of passionate sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0135.mp3|mister verloc was a humane man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0136.mp3|he had come home prepared to allow every latitude to his wife's affection for her brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0137.mp3|only he did not understand either the nature or the whole extent of that sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0138.mp3|and in this he was excusable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0139.mp3|since it was impossible for him to understand it without ceasing to be himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0140.mp3|he was startled and disappointed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0141.mp3|and his speech conveyed it by a certain roughness of tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0142.mp3|you might look at a fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0143.mp3|he observed after waiting a while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0146.mp3|almost pitiful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0147.mp3|i don't want to look at you as long as i live|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0149.mp3|what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0150.mp3|mister verloc was merely startled by the superficial and literal meaning of this declaration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0151.mp3|it was obviously unreasonable the mere cry of exaggerated grief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0152.mp3|he threw over it the mantle of his marital indulgence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0154.mp3|under the mistaken impression that the value of individuals consists in what they are in themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0156.mp3|she was taking it confoundedly hard he thought to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0157.mp3|it was all the fault of that damned heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0158.mp3|what did he want to upset the woman for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0159.mp3|but she mustn't be allowed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0160.mp3|for her own good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0161.mp3|to carry on so till she got quite beside herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0162.mp3|look here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0163.mp3|you can't sit like this in the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0164.mp3|he said with affected severity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0165.mp3|in which there was some real annoyance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0166.mp3|for urgent practical matters must be talked over if they had to sit up all night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0167.mp3|somebody might come in at any minute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0168.mp3|he added and waited again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0169.mp3|no effect was produced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0170.mp3|and the idea of the finality of death occurred to mister verloc during the pause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0171.mp3|he changed his tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0173.mp3|this won't bring him back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0174.mp3|he said gently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0175.mp3|feeling ready to take her in his arms and press her to his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0176.mp3|where impatience and compassion dwelt side by side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0179.mp3|he was moved in his simplicity to urge moderation by asserting the claims of his own personality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0180.mp3|do be reasonable winnie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0181.mp3|what would it have been if you had lost me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0182.mp3|he had vaguely expected to hear her cry out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0183.mp3|but she did not budge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0184.mp3|she leaned back a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0185.mp3|quieted down to a complete unreadable stillness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0186.mp3|mister verloc's heart began to beat faster with exasperation and something resembling alarm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0187.mp3|he laid his hand on her shoulder saying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0188.mp3|don't be a fool winnie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0189.mp3|she gave no sign|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0190.mp3|it was impossible to talk to any purpose with a woman whose face one cannot see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0191.mp3|mister verloc caught hold of his wife's wrists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0192.mp3|but her hands seemed glued fast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0193.mp3|she swayed forward bodily to his tug and nearly went off the chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0194.mp3|startled to feel her so helplessly limp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0195.mp3|he was trying to put her back on the chair when she stiffened suddenly all over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0196.mp3|tore herself out of his hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0197.mp3|ran out of the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0200.mp3|this was very swift|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0201.mp3|he had just a glimpse of her face and that much of her eyes that he knew she had not looked at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0203.mp3|because mister verloc instantly took his wife's place in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0204.mp3|mister verloc did not cover his face with his hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0205.mp3|but a sombre thoughtfulness veiled his features|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0206.mp3|a term of imprisonment could not be avoided|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0207.mp3|he did not wish now to avoid it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0208.mp3|a prison was a place as safe from certain unlawful vengeances as the grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0209.mp3|with this advantage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0210.mp3|that in a prison there is room for hope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0211.mp3|what he saw before him was a term of imprisonment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0212.mp3|an early release and then life abroad somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0213.mp3|such as he had contemplated already|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0214.mp3|in case of failure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0215.mp3|well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0216.mp3|it was a failure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0217.mp3|if not exactly the sort of failure he had feared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0219.mp3|so at least it seemed now to mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0220.mp3|his prestige with the embassy would have been immense if if his wife had not had the unlucky notion of sewing on the address inside stevie's overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0222.mp3|who was no fool|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0223.mp3|had soon perceived the extraordinary character of the influence he had over stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0224.mp3|though he did not understand exactly its origin the doctrine of his supreme wisdom and goodness inculcated by two anxious women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0225.mp3|in all the eventualities he had foreseen mister verloc had calculated with correct insight on stevie's instinctive loyalty and blind discretion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0226.mp3|the eventuality he had not foreseen had appalled him as a humane man and a fond husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0227.mp3|from every other point of view it was rather advantageous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0228.mp3|nothing can equal the everlasting discretion of death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0229.mp3|mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0231.mp3|could not help acknowledging that to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0232.mp3|because his sensibility did not stand in the way of his judgment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0233.mp3|stevie's violent disintegration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0234.mp3|however disturbing to think about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0235.mp3|only assured the success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0239.mp3|but the production of a moral effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0240.mp3|with much trouble and distress on mister verloc's part the effect might be said to have been produced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0243.mp3|most unexpectedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0244.mp3|it came home to roost in brett street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0245.mp3|mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0246.mp3|who had been struggling like a man in a nightmare for the preservation of his position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0247.mp3|accepted the blow in the spirit of a convinced fatalist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0248.mp3|the position was gone through no one's fault really|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0249.mp3|a small tiny fact had done it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0250.mp3|it was like slipping on a bit of orange peel in the dark and breaking your leg|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0251.mp3|mister verloc drew a weary breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0252.mp3|he nourished no resentment against his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0253.mp3|he thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0254.mp3|she will have to look after the shop while they keep me locked up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0255.mp3|and thinking also how cruelly she would miss stevie at first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0256.mp3|he felt greatly concerned about her health and spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0257.mp3|how would she stand her solitude absolutely alone in that house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0258.mp3|it would not do for her to break down while he was locked up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0259.mp3|what would become of the shop then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0260.mp3|the shop was an asset|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0262.mp3|he had no mind to be utterly ruined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0265.mp3|from regard for his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0267.mp3|and out of his line of sight in the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0268.mp3|she frightened him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0269.mp3|if only she had had her mother with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0270.mp3|but that silly old woman an angry dismay possessed mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0271.mp3|he must talk with his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0272.mp3|he could tell her certainly that a man does get desperate under certain circumstances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0273.mp3|but he did not go incontinently to impart to her that information|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0274.mp3|first of all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0275.mp3|it was clear to him that this evening was no time for business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0280.mp3|her arms were folded on the table and her head was lying on her arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0281.mp3|mister verloc contemplated her back and the arrangement of her hair for a time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0282.mp3|then walked away from the kitchen door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0284.mp3|almost disdainful incuriosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0285.mp3|the foundation of their accord in domestic life made it extremely difficult to get into contact with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0286.mp3|now this tragic necessity had arisen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0287.mp3|mister verloc felt this difficulty acutely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0288.mp3|he turned around the table in the parlour with his usual air of a large animal in a cage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0289.mp3|curiosity being one of the forms of self revelation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0290.mp3|a systematically incurious person remains always partly mysterious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0291.mp3|every time he passed near the door mister verloc glanced at his wife uneasily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0292.mp3|it was not that he was afraid of her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0293.mp3|mister verloc imagined himself loved by that woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0294.mp3|but she had not accustomed him to make confidences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0295.mp3|and the confidence he had to make was of a profound psychological order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0296.mp3|how with his want of practice could he tell her what he himself felt but vaguely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0297.mp3|that there are conspiracies of fatal destiny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0298.mp3|that a notion grows in a mind sometimes till it acquires an outward existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0299.mp3|an independent power of its own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0301.mp3|he could not inform her that a man may be haunted by a fat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0303.mp3|clean shaved face till the wildest expedient to get rid of it appears a child of wisdom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0304.mp3|on this mental reference to a first secretary of a great embassy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0305.mp3|mister verloc stopped in the doorway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0306.mp3|and looking down into the kitchen with an angry face and clenched fists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0307.mp3|addressed his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0308.mp3|you don't know what a brute i had to deal with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0309.mp3|he started off to make another perambulation of the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0310.mp3|then when he had come to the door again he stopped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0311.mp3|glaring in from the height of two steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0314.mp3|dangerous brute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0315.mp3|with no more sense than after all these years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0316.mp3|a man like me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0318.mp3|you didn't know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0319.mp3|quite right too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0320.mp3|what was the good of telling you that i stood the risk of having a knife stuck into me any time these seven years we've been married|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0321.mp3|i am not a chap to worry a woman that's fond of me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0322.mp3|you had no business to know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0323.mp3|mister verloc took another turn round the parlour fuming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0324.mp3|a venomous beast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0325.mp3|he began again from the doorway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0326.mp3|drive me out into a ditch to starve for a joke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0327.mp3|i could see he thought it was a damned good joke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0328.mp3|a man like me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0331.mp3|that's the man you've got married to my girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0332.mp3|he perceived that his wife had sat up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0334.mp3|mister verloc watched at her back as if he could read there the effect of his words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0337.mp3|with their bombs in their blamed pockets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0338.mp3|to get themselves caught on the frontier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0339.mp3|the old baron knew what i was worth to his country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0340.mp3|and here suddenly a swine comes along an ignorant overbearing swine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0342.mp3|stepping slowly down two steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0343.mp3|entered the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0344.mp3|took a tumbler off the dresser|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0345.mp3|and holding it in his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0347.mp3|without looking at his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0348.mp3|it wasn't the old baron who would have had the wicked folly of getting me to call on him at eleven in the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0350.mp3|if they had seen me going in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0351.mp3|would have made no bones about knocking me on the head sooner or later|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0354.mp3|turning on the tap above the sink|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0355.mp3|poured three glasses of water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0356.mp3|one after another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0357.mp3|down his throat to quench the fires of his indignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0359.mp3|he could not get over the disloyalty of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0360.mp3|this man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0361.mp3|who would not work at the usual hard tasks which society sets to its humbler members|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0362.mp3|had exercised his secret industry with an indefatigable devotion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0363.mp3|there was in mister verloc a fund of loyalty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0364.mp3|he had been loyal to his employers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0365.mp3|to the cause of social stability and to his affections too as became apparent when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0366.mp3|after standing the tumbler in the sink|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0368.mp3|saying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0369.mp3|if i hadn't thought of you i would have taken the bullying brute by the throat and rammed his head into the fireplace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0370.mp3|i'd have been more than a match for that pink faced smooth shaved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0372.mp3|neglected to finish the sentence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0373.mp3|as if there could be no doubt of the terminal word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0374.mp3|for the first time in his life he was taking that incurious woman into his confidence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0375.mp3|the singularity of the event|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0376.mp3|the force and importance of the personal feelings aroused in the course of this confession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0378.mp3|the boy's stuttering existence of fears and indignations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0379.mp3|together with the violence of his end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0381.mp3|for that reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0382.mp3|when he looked up he was startled by the inappropriate character of his wife's stare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0383.mp3|it was not a wild stare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0384.mp3|and it was not inattentive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0385.mp3|but its attention was peculiar and not satisfactory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0386.mp3|inasmuch that it seemed concentrated upon some point beyond mister verloc's person|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0387.mp3|the impression was so strong that mister verloc glanced over his shoulder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0388.mp3|there was nothing behind him there was just the whitewashed wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0389.mp3|the excellent husband of winnie verloc saw no writing on the wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0390.mp3|he turned to his wife again repeating with some emphasis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0391.mp3|i would have taken him by the throat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0392.mp3|as true as i stand here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0393.mp3|if i hadn't thought of you then i would have half choked the life out of the brute before i let him get up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0394.mp3|and don't you think he would have been anxious to call the police either|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0395.mp3|he wouldn't have dared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0396.mp3|you understand why don't you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0397.mp3|he blinked at his wife knowingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0400.mp3|and without looking at him at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0401.mp3|what are you talking about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0403.mp3|he had had a very full day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0404.mp3|and his nerves had been tried to the utmost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0405.mp3|after a month of maddening worry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0406.mp3|ending in an unexpected catastrophe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0407.mp3|the storm tossed spirit of mister verloc longed for repose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0408.mp3|his career as a secret agent had come to an end in a way no one could have foreseen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0409.mp3|only now perhaps he could manage to get a night's sleep at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0410.mp3|but looking at his wife he doubted it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0411.mp3|she was taking it very hard not at all like herself he thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0412.mp3|he made an effort to speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0413.mp3|you'll have to pull yourself together my girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0414.mp3|he said sympathetically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0415.mp3|what's done can't be undone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0417.mp3|though not a muscle of her white face moved in the least|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0418.mp3|mister verloc who was not looking at her continued ponderously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0419.mp3|you go to bed now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0420.mp3|what you want is a good cry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0421.mp3|this opinion had nothing to recommend it but the general consent of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0422.mp3|it is universally understood that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0423.mp3|as if it were nothing more substantial than vapour floating in the sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0424.mp3|every emotion of a woman is bound to end in a shower|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0425.mp3|and it is very probable that had stevie died in his bed under her despairing gaze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0426.mp3|in her protecting arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0429.mp3|in common with other human beings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0430.mp3|was provided with a fund of unconscious resignation sufficient to meet the normal manifestation of human destiny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0431.mp3|without|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0432.mp3|troubling her head about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0433.mp3|she was aware that it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0434.mp3|did not stand looking into very much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0435.mp3|but the lamentable circumstances of stevie's end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0436.mp3|which to mister verloc's mind had only an episodic character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0437.mp3|as part of a greater disaster|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0438.mp3|dried her tears at their very source|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0439.mp3|it was the effect of a white hot iron drawn across her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0440.mp3|at the same time her heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0441.mp3|hardened and chilled into a lump of ice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0442.mp3|kept her body in an inward shudder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0443.mp3|set her features into a frozen contemplative immobility addressed to a whitewashed wall with no writing on it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0446.mp3|when stripped of its philosophical reserve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0447.mp3|was maternal and violent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0448.mp3|forced her to roll a series of thoughts in her motionless head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0449.mp3|these thoughts were rather imagined than expressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0451.mp3|either for public or private use|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0452.mp3|with the rage and dismay of a betrayed woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0453.mp3|she reviewed the tenor of her life in visions concerned mostly with stevie's difficult existence from its earliest days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0454.mp3|it was a life of single purpose and of a noble unity of inspiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0455.mp3|like those rare lives that have left their mark on the thoughts and feelings of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0459.mp3|dark under the roof and scintillating exceedingly with lights and cut glass at the level of the street like a fairy palace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0461.mp3|she remembered brushing the boy's hair and tying his pinafores herself in a pinafore still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0462.mp3|the consolations administered to a small and badly scared creature by another creature nearly as small but not quite so badly scared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0463.mp3|she had the vision of the blows intercepted often with her own head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0464.mp3|of a door held desperately shut against a man's rage not for very long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0465.mp3|of a poker flung once not very far|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0466.mp3|which stilled that particular storm into the dumb and awful silence which follows a thunder clap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0467.mp3|and all these scenes of violence came and went accompanied by the unrefined noise of deep vociferations proceeding from a man wounded in his paternal pride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0468.mp3|declaring himself obviously accursed since one of his kids was a|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0470.mp3|it was of her that this had been said many years ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0472.mp3|and then the dreary shadow of the belgravian mansion descended upon her shoulders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0473.mp3|it was a crushing memory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0474.mp3|an exhausting vision of countless breakfast trays carried up and down innumerable stairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0475.mp3|of endless haggling over pence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0476.mp3|of the endless drudgery of sweeping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0479.mp3|from basement to attics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0480.mp3|while the impotent mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0481.mp3|staggering on swollen legs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0482.mp3|cooked in a grimy kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0483.mp3|and poor stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0484.mp3|the unconscious presiding genius of all their toil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0486.mp3|but this vision had a breath of a hot london summer in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0487.mp3|and for a central figure a young man wearing his sunday best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0488.mp3|with a straw hat on his dark head and a wooden pipe in his mouth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0489.mp3|affectionate and jolly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0490.mp3|he was a fascinating companion for a voyage down the sparkling stream of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0491.mp3|only his boat was very small|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0492.mp3|there was room in it for a girl partner at the oar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0493.mp3|but no accommodation for passengers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0494.mp3|he was allowed to drift away from the threshold of the belgravian mansion while winnie averted her tearful eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0495.mp3|he was not a lodger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0496.mp3|the lodger was mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0498.mp3|and keeping late hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0499.mp3|sleepily jocular of a morning from under his bed clothes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0501.mp3|and always with some money in his pockets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0502.mp3|there was no sparkle of any kind on the lazy stream of his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0503.mp3|it flowed through secret places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0505.mp3|and his taciturn magnanimity accepted as a matter of course the presence of passengers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0507.mp3|loyally paid for on her part|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0508.mp3|of security growing into confidence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0509.mp3|into a domestic feeling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0510.mp3|stagnant and deep like a placid pool|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0512.mp3|the robust anarchist with shamelessly inviting eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0513.mp3|whose glance had a corrupt clearness sufficient to enlighten any woman not absolutely imbecile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0514.mp3|a few seconds only had elapsed since the last word had been uttered aloud in the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0516.mp3|with eyes whose pupils were extremely dilated she stared at the vision of her husband and poor stevie walking up brett street side by side away from the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0518.mp3|an existence foreign to all grace and charm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0519.mp3|without beauty and almost without decency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0520.mp3|but admirable in the continuity of feeling and tenacity of purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0521.mp3|and this last vision had such plastic relief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0522.mp3|such nearness of form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0523.mp3|such a fidelity of suggestive detail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0525.mp3|reproducing the supreme illusion of her life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0527.mp3|might have been father and son|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0530.mp3|what did you say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0531.mp3|he asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0532.mp3|receiving no reply he resumed his sinister tramping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0533.mp3|then with a menacing flourish of a thick fleshy fist he burst out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0535.mp3|the embassy people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0536.mp3|a pretty lot ain't they|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0537.mp3|before a week's out i'll make some of them wish themselves twenty feet underground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0539.mp3|what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0540.mp3|he glanced sideways with his head down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0542.mp3|a blank wall perfectly blank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0543.mp3|a blankness to run at and dash your head against|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0545.mp3|she kept still as the population of half the globe would keep still in astonishment and despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0546.mp3|were the sun suddenly put out in the summer sky by the perfidy of a trusted providence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0547.mp3|the embassy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0548.mp3|mister verloc began again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0549.mp3|after a preliminary grimace which bared his teeth wolfishly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0552.mp3|but never mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0553.mp3|i'll teach them yet what it means trying to throw out a man like me to rot in the streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0554.mp3|i've a tongue in my head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0555.mp3|all the world shall know what i've done for them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0556.mp3|i am not afraid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0557.mp3|i don't care|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0559.mp3|every damned thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0560.mp3|let them look out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0562.mp3|it was a very appropriate revenge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0563.mp3|it was in harmony with the promptings of mister verloc's genius|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0564.mp3|it had also the advantage of being within the range of his powers and of adjusting itself easily to the practice of his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0565.mp3|which had consisted precisely in betraying the secret and unlawful proceedings of his fellow men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0566.mp3|anarchists or diplomats were all one to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0568.mp3|his scorn was equally distributed over the whole field of his operations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0569.mp3|but as a member of a revolutionary proletariat which he undoubtedly was he nourished a rather inimical sentiment against social distinction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0570.mp3|nothing on earth can stop me now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0571.mp3|he added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0572.mp3|and paused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0573.mp3|looking fixedly at his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0574.mp3|who was looking fixedly at a blank wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0575.mp3|the silence in the kitchen was prolonged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0576.mp3|and mister verloc felt disappointed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0577.mp3|he had expected his wife to say something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0579.mp3|composed in their usual form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0581.mp3|and mister verloc was disappointed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0583.mp3|she was a woman of very few words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0584.mp3|for reasons involved in the very foundation of his psychology|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0585.mp3|mister verloc was inclined to put his trust in any woman who had given herself to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0586.mp3|therefore he trusted his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0588.mp3|it was a tacit accord|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0590.mp3|which were indolent and secret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0591.mp3|they refrained from going to the bottom of facts and motives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0592.mp3|this reserve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0595.mp3|their profound confidence in each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0596.mp3|introduced at the same time a certain element of vagueness into their intimacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0597.mp3|no system of conjugal relations is perfect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0599.mp3|but he would have been glad to hear her say what she thought at the moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0600.mp3|it would have been a comfort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0601.mp3|there were several reasons why this comfort was denied him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0602.mp3|there was a physical obstacle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0604.mp3|she did not see any alternative between screaming and silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0605.mp3|and instinctively she chose the silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0607.mp3|and there was the paralysing atrocity of the thought which occupied her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0608.mp3|her cheeks were blanched her lips ashy her immobility amazing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0609.mp3|and she thought without looking at mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0610.mp3|this man took the boy away to murder him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0611.mp3|he took the boy away from his home to murder him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0612.mp3|he took the boy away from me to murder him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0615.mp3|mentally she assumed the biblical attitude of mourning the covered face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0616.mp3|the rent garments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0617.mp3|the sound of wailing and lamentation filled her head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0618.mp3|but her teeth were violently clenched|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0619.mp3|and her tearless eyes were hot with rage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0620.mp3|because she was not a submissive creature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0621.mp3|the protection she had extended over her brother had been in its origin of a fierce and indignant complexion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0622.mp3|she had to love him with a militant love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0623.mp3|she had battled for him even against herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0624.mp3|his loss had the bitterness of defeat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0625.mp3|with the anguish of a baffled passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0626.mp3|it was not an ordinary stroke of death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0627.mp3|moreover it was not death that took stevie from her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0628.mp3|it was mister verloc who took him away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0629.mp3|she had seen him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0630.mp3|she had watched him without raising a hand take the boy away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0631.mp3|and she had let him go like like a fool a blind fool|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0632.mp3|then after he had murdered the boy he came home to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0633.mp3|just came home like any other man would come home to his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0635.mp3|and i thought he had caught a cold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0636.mp3|mister verloc heard these words and appropriated them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0637.mp3|it was nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0638.mp3|he said moodily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0639.mp3|i was upset|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0640.mp3|i was upset on your account|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0642.mp3|turning her head slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0643.mp3|transferred her stare from the wall to her husband's person|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0644.mp3|mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0645.mp3|with the tips of his fingers between his lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0646.mp3|was looking on the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0647.mp3|can't be helped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0648.mp3|he mumbled letting his hand fall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0649.mp3|you must pull yourself together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0650.mp3|you'll want all your wits about you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0651.mp3|it is you who brought the police about our ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0652.mp3|never mind i won't say anything more about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0653.mp3|continued mister verloc magnanimously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0654.mp3|you couldn't know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0657.mp3|it was as if a corpse had spoken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0658.mp3|mister verloc took up the thread of his discourse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0659.mp3|i don't blame you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0660.mp3|i'll make them sit up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0661.mp3|once under lock and key it will be safe enough for me to talk you understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0662.mp3|you must reckon on me being two years away from you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0663.mp3|he continued in a tone of sincere concern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0664.mp3|it will be easier for you than for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0668.mp3|what you must do is to keep this business going for two years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0669.mp3|you know enough for that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0670.mp3|you've a good head on you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0671.mp3|i'll send you word when it's time to go about trying to sell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0672.mp3|you'll have to be extra careful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0673.mp3|the comrades will be keeping an eye on you all the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0674.mp3|you'll have to be as artful as you know how and as close as the grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0676.mp3|i have no mind to get a knock on the head or a stab in the back directly i am let out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0677.mp3|thus spoke mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0678.mp3|applying his mind with ingenuity and forethought to the problems of the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0679.mp3|his voice was sombre|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0680.mp3|because he had a correct sentiment of the situation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0681.mp3|everything which he did not wish to pass had come to pass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0682.mp3|the future had become precarious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0683.mp3|his judgment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0686.mp3|a man somewhat over forty may be excusably thrown into considerable disorder by the prospect of losing his employment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0687.mp3|especially if the man is a secret agent of political police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0688.mp3|dwelling secure in the consciousness of his high value and in the esteem of high personages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0689.mp3|he was excusable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0690.mp3|now the thing had ended in a crash|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0691.mp3|mister verloc was cool but he was not cheerful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0692.mp3|a secret agent who throws his secrecy to the winds from desire of vengeance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0694.mp3|becomes the mark for desperate and bloodthirsty indignations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0695.mp3|without unduly exaggerating the danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0696.mp3|mister verloc tried to bring it clearly before his wife's mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0697.mp3|he repeated that he had no intention to let the revolutionists do away with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0698.mp3|he looked straight into his wife's eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0699.mp3|the enlarged pupils of the woman received his stare into their unfathomable depths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0700.mp3|i am too fond of you for that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0701.mp3|he said with a little nervous laugh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0703.mp3|having done with the visions of the past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0704.mp3|she had not only heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0705.mp3|but had also understood the words uttered by her husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0706.mp3|by their extreme disaccord with her mental condition these words produced on her a slightly suffocating effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0708.mp3|but it was not sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0709.mp3|it was governed too much by a fixed idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0710.mp3|every nook and cranny of her brain was filled with the thought that this man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0711.mp3|with whom she had lived without distaste for seven years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0714.mp3|away from her in order to kill him the man to whom she had grown accustomed in body and mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0715.mp3|the man whom she had trusted took the boy away to kill him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0716.mp3|in its form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0717.mp3|in its substance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0718.mp3|in its effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0719.mp3|which was universal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0720.mp3|altering even the aspect of inanimate things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0721.mp3|it was a thought to sit still and marvel at for ever and ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0724.mp3|familiarly in hat and overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0725.mp3|stamping with his boots upon her brain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0726.mp3|he was probably talking too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0728.mp3|now and then however the voice would make itself heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0729.mp3|several connected words emerged at times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0730.mp3|their purport was generally hopeful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0732.mp3|losing their far off fixity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0733.mp3|followed her husband's movements with the effect of black care and impenetrable attention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0734.mp3|well informed upon all matters relating to his secret calling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0735.mp3|mister verloc augured well for the success of his plans and combinations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0736.mp3|he really believed that it would be upon the whole easy for him to escape the knife of infuriated revolutionists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0738.mp3|for to exaggerate with judgment one must begin by measuring with nicety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0740.mp3|his first really confidential discourse to his wife was optimistic from conviction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0741.mp3|he also thought it good policy to display all the assurance he could muster|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0742.mp3|it would put heart into the poor woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0743.mp3|on his liberation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0744.mp3|which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0748.mp3|they would vanish together without loss of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0749.mp3|as to covering up the tracks he begged his wife to trust him for that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0750.mp3|he knew how it was to be done so that the devil himself he waved his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0752.mp3|he wished only to put heart into her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0753.mp3|it was a benevolent intention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0754.mp3|but mister verloc had the misfortune not to be in accord with his audience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0756.mp3|for what were words to her now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0757.mp3|what could words do to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0758.mp3|for good or evil in the face of her fixed idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0761.mp3|but her heart began to beat very perceptibly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0763.mp3|in a soft and conjugal tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0764.mp3|was now expressing his firm belief that there were yet a good few years of quiet life before them both|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0765.mp3|he did not go into the question of means|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0768.mp3|nestling in the shade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0769.mp3|concealed among men whose flesh is grass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0770.mp3|modest like the life of violets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0771.mp3|the words used by mister verloc were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0772.mp3|lie low for a bit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0773.mp3|and far from england of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0774.mp3|it was not clear whether mister verloc had in his mind spain or south america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0775.mp3|but at any rate somewhere abroad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0776.mp3|this last word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0778.mp3|produced a definite impression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0779.mp3|this man was talking of going abroad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0780.mp3|the impression was completely disconnected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0782.mp3|and what of stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0783.mp3|it was a sort of forgetfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0784.mp3|but instantly she became aware that there was no longer any occasion for anxiety on that score|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0785.mp3|there would never be any occasion any more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0786.mp3|the poor boy had been taken out and killed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0787.mp3|the poor boy was dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0789.mp3|she began to perceive certain consequences which would have surprised mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0790.mp3|there was no need for her now to stay there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0791.mp3|in that kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0792.mp3|in that house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0793.mp3|with that man since the boy was gone for ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0794.mp3|no need whatever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0796.mp3|but neither could she see what there was to keep her in the world at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0797.mp3|and this inability arrested her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0798.mp3|mister verloc watched her with marital solicitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0799.mp3|you're looking more like yourself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0800.mp3|he said uneasily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0801.mp3|something peculiar in the blackness of his wife's eyes disturbed his optimism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0803.mp3|she had her freedom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0804.mp3|her contract with existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0805.mp3|as represented by that man standing over there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0806.mp3|was at an end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0807.mp3|she was a free woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0808.mp3|had this view become in some way perceptible to mister verloc he would have been extremely shocked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0810.mp3|yet always with no other idea than that of being loved for himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0811.mp3|upon this matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0812.mp3|his ethical notions being in agreement with his vanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0813.mp3|he was completely incorrigible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0814.mp3|that this should be so in the case of his virtuous and legal connection he was perfectly certain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0815.mp3|he had grown older|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0816.mp3|fatter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0817.mp3|heavier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0818.mp3|in the belief that he lacked no fascination for being loved for his own sake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0820.mp3|where are you going to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0821.mp3|he called out rather sharply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0822.mp3|upstairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0824.mp3|an instinct of prudence born of fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0825.mp3|the excessive fear of being approached and touched by that man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0826.mp3|induced her to nod at him slightly from the height of two steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0828.mp3|that's right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0829.mp3|he encouraged her gruffly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0831.mp3|go on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0832.mp3|it won't be long before i am with you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0834.mp3|the free woman who had had really no idea where she was going to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_11_conrad_0835.mp3|obeyed the suggestion with rigid steadiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0001.mp3|she disappeared up the stairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0002.mp3|he was disappointed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0003.mp3|there was that within him which would have been more satisfied if she had been moved to throw herself upon his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0004.mp3|but he was generous and indulgent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0006.mp3|neither was mister verloc himself prodigal of endearments and words as a rule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0007.mp3|but this was not an ordinary evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0008.mp3|it was an occasion when a man wants to be fortified and strengthened by open proofs of sympathy and affection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0009.mp3|mister verloc sighed and put out the gas in the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0011.mp3|it almost brought tears into his eyes as he stood in the parlour reflecting on the loneliness hanging over her head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0012.mp3|in this mood mister verloc missed stevie very much out of a difficult world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0013.mp3|he thought mournfully of his end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0014.mp3|if only that lad had not stupidly destroyed himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0017.mp3|overcame him again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0018.mp3|the piece of roast beef|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0019.mp3|laid out in the likeness of funereal baked meats for stevie's obsequies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0020.mp3|offered itself largely to his notice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0021.mp3|and mister verloc again partook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0022.mp3|he partook ravenously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0023.mp3|without restraint and decency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0024.mp3|cutting thick slices with the sharp carving knife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0025.mp3|and swallowing them without bread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0028.mp3|but also took from him the inclination to follow her upstairs just yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0029.mp3|laying down the carving knife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0031.mp3|he was comforted by hearing her move at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0032.mp3|she walked suddenly across the room and threw the window up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0033.mp3|after a period of stillness up there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0034.mp3|during which he figured her to himself with her head out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0035.mp3|he heard the sash being lowered slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0036.mp3|then she made a few steps and sat down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0038.mp3|who was thoroughly domesticated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0039.mp3|when next he heard his wife's footsteps overhead he knew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0040.mp3|as well as if he had seen her doing it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0041.mp3|that she had been putting on her walking shoes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0043.mp3|and moving away from the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0044.mp3|stood with his back to the fireplace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0045.mp3|his head on one side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0046.mp3|and gnawing perplexedly at the tips of his fingers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0047.mp3|he kept track of her movements by the sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0048.mp3|she walked here and there violently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0049.mp3|with abrupt stoppages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0050.mp3|now before the chest of drawers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0051.mp3|then in front of the wardrobe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0052.mp3|an immense load of weariness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0053.mp3|the harvest of a day of shocks and surprises|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0054.mp3|weighed mister verloc's energies to the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0055.mp3|he did not raise his eyes till he heard his wife descending the stairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0056.mp3|it was as he had guessed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0057.mp3|she was dressed for going out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0059.mp3|she had thrown open the window of the bedroom either with the intention of screaming murder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0060.mp3|help|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0061.mp3|or of throwing herself out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0063.mp3|her personality seemed to have been torn into two pieces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0064.mp3|whose mental operations did not adjust themselves very well to each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0065.mp3|the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0066.mp3|silent and deserted from end to end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0067.mp3|repelled her by taking sides with that man who was so certain of his impunity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0068.mp3|she was afraid to shout lest no one should come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0069.mp3|obviously no one would come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0070.mp3|her instinct of self preservation recoiled from the depth of the fall into that sort of slimy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0071.mp3|deep trench|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0073.mp3|and dressed herself to go out into the street by another way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0074.mp3|she was a free woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0075.mp3|she had dressed herself thoroughly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0076.mp3|down to the tying of a black veil over her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0079.mp3|flying off to her mother of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0080.mp3|the thought that women were wearisome creatures after all presented itself to his fatigued brain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0081.mp3|but he was too generous to harbour it for more than an instant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0082.mp3|this man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0083.mp3|hurt cruelly in his vanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0084.mp3|remained magnanimous in his conduct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0085.mp3|allowing himself no satisfaction of a bitter smile or of a contemptuous gesture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0086.mp3|with true greatness of soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0087.mp3|he only glanced at the wooden clock on the wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0088.mp3|and said in a perfectly calm but forcible manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0089.mp3|five and twenty minutes past eight winnie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0090.mp3|there's no sense in going over there so late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0091.mp3|you will never manage to get back to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0093.mp3|he added heavily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0094.mp3|your mother will be gone to bed before you get there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0095.mp3|this is the sort of news that can wait|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0097.mp3|she recoiled at the mere idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0098.mp3|and feeling a chair behind her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0099.mp3|she obeyed the suggestion of the touch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0100.mp3|and sat down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0102.mp3|and if this feeling was correct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0103.mp3|its mental form took an unrefined shape corresponding to her origin and station|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0104.mp3|i would rather walk the streets all the days of my life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0105.mp3|she thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0106.mp3|but this creature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0107.mp3|whose moral nature had been subjected to a shock of which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0108.mp3|in the physical order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0109.mp3|the most violent earthquake of history could only be a faint and languid rendering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0110.mp3|was at the mercy of mere trifles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0111.mp3|of casual contacts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0112.mp3|she sat down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0113.mp3|with her hat and veil she had the air of a visitor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0117.mp3|let me tell you winnie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0118.mp3|he said with authority|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0119.mp3|that your place is here this evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0120.mp3|hang it all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0121.mp3|you brought the damned police high and low about my ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0122.mp3|i don't blame you but it's your doing all the same|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0123.mp3|you'd better take this confounded hat off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0124.mp3|i can't let you go out old girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0125.mp3|he added in a softened voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0128.mp3|of course he wouldn't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0129.mp3|now he had murdered stevie he would never let her go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0130.mp3|he would want to keep her for nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0131.mp3|and on this characteristic reasoning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0132.mp3|having all the force of insane logic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0134.mp3|she could slip by him open the door run out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0135.mp3|but he would dash out after her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0137.mp3|drag her back into the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0138.mp3|she could scratch kick and bite and stab too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0139.mp3|but for stabbing she wanted a knife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0141.mp3|in her own house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0142.mp3|like a masked and mysterious visitor of impenetrable intentions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0143.mp3|mister verloc's magnanimity was not more than human|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0144.mp3|she had exasperated him at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0145.mp3|can't you say something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0146.mp3|you have your own dodges for vexing a man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0149.mp3|i've seen you at it before to day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0150.mp3|but just now it won't do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0151.mp3|and to begin with take this damned thing off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0152.mp3|one can't tell whether one is talking to a dummy or to a live woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0154.mp3|and stretching out his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0155.mp3|dragged the veil off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0157.mp3|unreadable face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0158.mp3|against which his nervous exasperation was shattered like a glass bubble flung against a rock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0159.mp3|that's better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0161.mp3|to cover his momentary uneasiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0162.mp3|and retreated back to his old station by the mantelpiece|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0163.mp3|it never entered his head that his wife could give him up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0164.mp3|he felt a little ashamed of himself for he was fond and generous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0165.mp3|what could he do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0166.mp3|everything had been said already|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0167.mp3|he protested vehemently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0168.mp3|by heavens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0169.mp3|you know that i hunted high and low|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0170.mp3|i ran the risk of giving myself away to find somebody for that accursed job|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0172.mp3|what do you take me for a murderer or what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0173.mp3|the boy is gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0175.mp3|he's gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0176.mp3|his troubles are over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0179.mp3|precisely because he did blow himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0180.mp3|i don't blame you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0181.mp3|but just try to understand that it was a pure accident|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0183.mp3|his generosity was not infinite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0184.mp3|because he was a human being and not a monster|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0186.mp3|he paused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0187.mp3|and a snarl lifting his moustaches above a gleam of white teeth gave him the expression of a reflective beast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0188.mp3|not very dangerous a slow beast with a sleek head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0189.mp3|gloomier than a seal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0190.mp3|and with a husky voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0191.mp3|and when it comes to that it's as much your doing as mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0193.mp3|you may glare as much as you like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0194.mp3|i know what you can do in that way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0195.mp3|strike me dead if i ever would have thought of the lad for that purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0196.mp3|it was you who kept on shoving him in my way when i was half distracted with the worry of keeping the lot of us out of trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0197.mp3|what the devil made you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0198.mp3|one would think you were doing it on purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0199.mp3|and i am damned if i know that you didn't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0202.mp3|his husky domestic voice ceased for a while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0204.mp3|before that silence he felt ashamed of what he had said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0205.mp3|but as often happens to peaceful men in domestic tiffs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0206.mp3|being ashamed he pushed another point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0207.mp3|you have a devilish way of holding your tongue sometimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0208.mp3|he began again without raising his voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0209.mp3|enough to make some men go mad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0211.mp3|i am fond of you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0212.mp3|but don't you go too far|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0213.mp3|this isn't the time for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0214.mp3|we ought to be thinking of what we've got to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0215.mp3|and i can't let you go out to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0216.mp3|galloping off to your mother with some crazy tale or other about me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0217.mp3|i won't have it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0218.mp3|don't you make any mistake about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0220.mp3|then you've killed him as much as i|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0222.mp3|these words went far beyond anything that had ever been said in this home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0223.mp3|kept up on the wages of a secret industry eked out by the sale of more or less secret wares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0224.mp3|the poor expedients devised by a mediocre mankind for preserving an imperfect society from the dangers of moral and physical corruption|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0225.mp3|both secret too of their kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0226.mp3|they were spoken because mister verloc had felt himself really outraged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0227.mp3|but the reticent decencies of this home life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0228.mp3|nestling in a shady street behind a shop where the sun never shone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0229.mp3|remained apparently undisturbed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0231.mp3|and then rose from her chair in her hat and jacket like a visitor at the end of a call|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0232.mp3|she advanced towards her husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0233.mp3|one arm extended as if for a silent leave taking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0236.mp3|mister verloc was no longer standing there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0237.mp3|he had moved off in the direction of the sofa|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0239.mp3|he was tired resigned in a truly marital spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0240.mp3|but he felt hurt in the tender spot of his secret weakness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0241.mp3|if she would go on sulking in that dreadful overcharged silence why then she must|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0242.mp3|she was a master in that domestic art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0243.mp3|mister verloc flung himself heavily upon the sofa|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0244.mp3|disregarding as usual the fate of his hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0246.mp3|as if accustomed to take care of itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0247.mp3|made for a safe shelter under the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0248.mp3|he was tired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0249.mp3|the last particle of his nervous force had been expended in the wonders and agonies of this day full of surprising failures coming at the end of a harassing month of scheming and insomnia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0250.mp3|he was tired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0251.mp3|a man isn't made of stone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0252.mp3|hang everything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0253.mp3|mister verloc reposed characteristically clad in his outdoor garments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0254.mp3|one side of his open overcoat was lying partly on the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0255.mp3|mister verloc wallowed on his back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0256.mp3|but he longed for a more perfect rest for sleep for a few hours of delicious forgetfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0257.mp3|that would come later|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0258.mp3|provisionally he rested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0259.mp3|and he thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0261.mp3|it's exasperating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0263.mp3|instead of taking the way of the door she leaned back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0264.mp3|with her shoulders against the tablet of the mantelpiece|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0266.mp3|a tinge of wildness in her aspect was derived from the black veil hanging like a rag against her cheek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0267.mp3|and from the fixity of her black gaze where the light of the room was absorbed and lost without the trace of a single gleam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0268.mp3|this woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0269.mp3|capable of a bargain the mere suspicion of which would have been infinitely shocking to mister verloc's idea of love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0270.mp3|remained irresolute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0271.mp3|as if scrupulously aware of something wanting on her part for the formal closing of the transaction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0272.mp3|on the sofa mister verloc wriggled his shoulders into perfect comfort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0274.mp3|i wish to goodness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0275.mp3|he growled huskily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0276.mp3|i had never seen greenwich park or anything belonging to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0277.mp3|the veiled sound filled the small room with its moderate volume|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0279.mp3|the waves of air of the proper length|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0280.mp3|propagated in accordance with correct mathematical formulas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0281.mp3|flowed around all the inanimate things in the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0283.mp3|and incredible as it may appear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0285.mp3|the audible wish of mister verloc's overflowing heart flowed into an empty place in his wife's memory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0286.mp3|greenwich park|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0287.mp3|a park|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0288.mp3|that's where the boy was killed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0289.mp3|a park smashed branches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0290.mp3|torn leaves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0292.mp3|bits of brotherly flesh and bone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0293.mp3|all spouting up together in the manner of a firework|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0294.mp3|she remembered now what she had heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0295.mp3|and she remembered it pictorially|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0296.mp3|they had to gather him up with the shovel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0297.mp3|trembling all over with irrepressible shudders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0298.mp3|she saw before her the very implement with its ghastly load scraped up from the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0302.mp3|and fading out slowly like the last star of a pyrotechnic display|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0304.mp3|her face was no longer stony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0305.mp3|anybody could have noted the subtle change on her features|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0306.mp3|in the stare of her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0307.mp3|giving her a new and startling expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0308.mp3|an expression seldom observed by competent persons under the conditions of leisure and security demanded for thorough analysis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0309.mp3|but whose meaning could not be mistaken at a glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0312.mp3|no longer disconnected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0313.mp3|were working under the control of her will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0314.mp3|but mister verloc observed nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0315.mp3|he was reposing in that pathetic condition of optimism induced by excess of fatigue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0316.mp3|he did not want any more trouble with his wife too of all people in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0317.mp3|he had been unanswerable in his vindication|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0318.mp3|he was loved for himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0319.mp3|the present phase of her silence he interpreted favourably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0320.mp3|this was the time to make it up with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0321.mp3|the silence had lasted long enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0322.mp3|he broke it by calling to her in an undertone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0324.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0326.mp3|she commanded her wits now her vocal organs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0327.mp3|she felt herself to be in an almost preternaturally perfect control of every fibre of her body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0328.mp3|it was all her own because the bargain was at an end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0329.mp3|she was clear sighted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0330.mp3|she had become cunning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0331.mp3|she chose to answer him so readily for a purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0332.mp3|she did not wish that man to change his position on the sofa which was very suitable to the circumstances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0333.mp3|she succeeded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0334.mp3|the man did not stir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0335.mp3|but after answering him she remained leaning negligently against the mantelpiece in the attitude of a resting wayfarer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0336.mp3|she was unhurried|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0337.mp3|her brow was smooth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0338.mp3|the head and shoulders of mister verloc were hidden from her by the high side of the sofa|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0339.mp3|she kept her eyes fixed on his feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0340.mp3|she remained thus mysteriously still and suddenly collected till mister verloc was heard with an accent of marital authority|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0341.mp3|and moving slightly to make room for her to sit on the edge of the sofa|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0342.mp3|come here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0343.mp3|he said in a peculiar tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0344.mp3|which might have been the tone of brutality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0346.mp3|she started forward at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0348.mp3|her right hand skimmed slightly the end of the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0349.mp3|and when she had passed on towards the sofa the carving knife had vanished without the slightest sound from the side of the dish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0350.mp3|mister verloc heard the creaky plank in the floor and was content|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0353.mp3|as if the homeless soul of stevie had flown for shelter straight to the breast of his sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0354.mp3|guardian and protector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0355.mp3|the resemblance of her face with that of her brother grew at every step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0356.mp3|even to the droop of the lower lip|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0357.mp3|even to the slight divergence of the eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0358.mp3|but mister verloc did not see that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0359.mp3|he was lying on his back and staring upwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0360.mp3|he saw partly on the ceiling and partly on the wall the moving shadow of an arm with a clenched hand holding a carving knife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0361.mp3|it flickered up and down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0362.mp3|its movements were leisurely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0364.mp3|they were leisurely enough for him to take in the full meaning of the portent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0365.mp3|and to taste the flavour of death rising in his gorge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0366.mp3|his wife had gone raving mad murdering mad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0367.mp3|they were leisurely enough for the first paralysing effect of this discovery to pass away before a resolute determination to come out victorious from the ghastly struggle with that armed lunatic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0368.mp3|they were leisurely enough for mister verloc to elaborate a plan of defence involving a dash behind the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0369.mp3|and the felling of the woman to the ground with a heavy wooden chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0370.mp3|but they were not leisurely enough to allow mister verloc the time to move either hand or foot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0371.mp3|the knife was already planted in his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0372.mp3|it met no resistance on its way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0374.mp3|into that plunging blow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0375.mp3|delivered over the side of the couch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0377.mp3|the simple ferocity of the age of caverns|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0378.mp3|and the unbalanced nervous fury of the age of bar rooms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0380.mp3|the secret agent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0381.mp3|turning slightly on his side with the force of the blow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0382.mp3|expired without stirring a limb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0383.mp3|in the muttered sound of the word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0385.mp3|by way of protest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0387.mp3|and her extraordinary resemblance to her late brother had faded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0388.mp3|had become very ordinary now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0389.mp3|she drew a deep breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0390.mp3|the first easy breath since chief inspector heat had exhibited to her the labelled piece of stevie's overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0391.mp3|she leaned forward on her folded arms over the side of the sofa|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0393.mp3|but because of the undulatory and swinging movements of the parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0394.mp3|which for some time behaved as though it were at sea in a tempest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0395.mp3|she was giddy but calm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0396.mp3|she had become a free woman with a perfection of freedom which left her nothing to desire and absolutely nothing to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0397.mp3|since stevie's urgent claim on her devotion no longer existed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0399.mp3|who thought in images|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0400.mp3|was not troubled now by visions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0401.mp3|because she did not think at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0402.mp3|and she did not move|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0403.mp3|she was a woman enjoying her complete irresponsibility and endless leisure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0404.mp3|almost in the manner of a corpse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0405.mp3|she did not move she did not think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0406.mp3|neither did the mortal envelope of the late mister verloc reposing on the sofa|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0408.mp3|that accord of prudent reserve without superfluous words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0409.mp3|and sparing of signs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0410.mp3|which had been the foundation of their respectable home life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0411.mp3|for it had been respectable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0412.mp3|covering by a decent reticence the problems that may arise in the practice of a secret profession and the commerce of shady wares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0413.mp3|to the last its decorum had remained undisturbed by unseemly shrieks and other misplaced sincerities of conduct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0414.mp3|and after the striking of the blow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0415.mp3|this respectability was continued in immobility and silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0417.mp3|she had become aware of a ticking sound in the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0418.mp3|it grew upon her ear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0419.mp3|while she remembered clearly that the clock on the wall was silent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0420.mp3|had no audible tick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0421.mp3|what did it mean by beginning to tick so loudly all of a sudden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0422.mp3|its face indicated ten minutes to nine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0425.mp3|and her sullen gaze moved along the walls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0427.mp3|and became vague|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0428.mp3|while she strained her hearing to locate the sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0432.mp3|mister verloc was taking his habitual ease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0433.mp3|he looked comfortable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0437.mp3|sleepy eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0438.mp3|travelling downward on the track of the sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0439.mp3|became contemplative on meeting a flat object of bone which protruded a little beyond the edge of the sofa|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0442.mp3|with a sound of ticking growing fast and furious like the pulse of an insane clock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0443.mp3|at its highest speed this ticking changed into a continuous sound of trickling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0445.mp3|it was a trickle dark swift thin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0448.mp3|with a sudden snatch at her skirts and a faint shriek she ran to the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0449.mp3|as if the trickle had been the first sign of a destroying flood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0450.mp3|finding the table in her way she gave it a push with both hands as though it had been alive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0453.mp3|scraping racket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0454.mp3|whilst the big dish with the joint crashed heavily on the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0455.mp3|then all became still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_12_conrad_0457.mp3|a round hat disclosed in the middle of the floor by the moving of the table rocked slightly on its crown in the wind of her flight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0001.mp3|the widow of mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0002.mp3|the sister of the late faithful stevie blown to fragments in a state of innocence and in the conviction of being engaged in a humanitarian enterprise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0003.mp3|did not run beyond the door of the parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0004.mp3|she had indeed run away so far from a mere trickle of blood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0005.mp3|but that was a movement of instinctive repulsion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0006.mp3|and there she had paused with staring eyes and lowered head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0007.mp3|as though she had run through long years in her flight across the small parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0009.mp3|a little swimmy in her head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0010.mp3|but otherwise free to enjoy the profound calm of idleness and irresponsibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0012.mp3|her head was steady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0013.mp3|on the other hand she was no longer calm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0014.mp3|she was afraid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0015.mp3|if she avoided looking in the direction of her reposing husband it was not because she was afraid of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0017.mp3|he looked comfortable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0018.mp3|moreover he was dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0020.mp3|nothing brings them back neither love nor hate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0021.mp3|they can do nothing to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0022.mp3|they are as nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0023.mp3|her mental state was tinged by a sort of austere contempt for that man who had let himself be killed so easily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0024.mp3|he had been the master of a house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0025.mp3|the husband of a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0026.mp3|and the murderer of her stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0027.mp3|and now he was of no account in every respect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0028.mp3|he was of less practical account than the clothing on his body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0029.mp3|than his overcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0030.mp3|than his boots than that hat lying on the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0031.mp3|he was nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0032.mp3|he was not worth looking at|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0033.mp3|he was even no longer the murderer of poor stevie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0034.mp3|the only murderer that would be found in the room when people came to look for mister verloc would be herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0035.mp3|her hands shook so that she failed twice in the task of refastening her veil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0037.mp3|she was afraid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0040.mp3|of tears dried up in her hot eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0041.mp3|of the maddening and indignant rage at the atrocious part played by that man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0042.mp3|who was less than nothing now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0043.mp3|in robbing her of the boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0044.mp3|it had been an obscurely prompted blow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0045.mp3|the blood trickling on the floor off the handle of the knife had turned it into an extremely plain case of murder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0047.mp3|who always refrained from looking deep into things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0048.mp3|was compelled to look into the very bottom of this thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0050.mp3|no reproachful shade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0052.mp3|no sort of ideal conception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0053.mp3|she saw there an object|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0054.mp3|that object was the gallows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0057.mp3|having never set eyes on that last argument of men's justice except in illustrative woodcuts to a certain type of tales|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0058.mp3|she first saw them erect against a black and stormy background|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0059.mp3|festooned with chains and human bones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0060.mp3|circled about by birds that peck at dead men's eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0061.mp3|this was frightful enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0063.mp3|though not a well informed woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0065.mp3|but in the yards of jails|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0066.mp3|there within four high walls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0067.mp3|as if into a pit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0068.mp3|at dawn of day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0069.mp3|the murderer was brought out to be executed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0070.mp3|with a horrible quietness and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0071.mp3|as the reports in the newspapers always said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0072.mp3|in the presence of the authorities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0073.mp3|with her eyes staring on the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0074.mp3|her nostrils quivering with anguish and shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0075.mp3|she imagined herself all alone amongst a lot of strange gentlemen in silk hats who were calmly proceeding about the business of hanging her by the neck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0076.mp3|that never|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0079.mp3|the impossibility of imagining the details of such quiet execution added something maddening to her abstract terror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0080.mp3|the newspapers never gave any details except one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0081.mp3|but that one with some affectation was always there at the end of a meagre report|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0083.mp3|it came with a cruel burning pain into her head as if the words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0084.mp3|the drop given was fourteen feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0085.mp3|had been scratched on her brain with a hot needle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0086.mp3|the drop given was fourteen feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0087.mp3|these words affected her physically too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0088.mp3|her throat became convulsed in waves to resist strangulation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0089.mp3|and the apprehension of the jerk was so vivid that she seized her head in both hands as if to save it from being torn off her shoulders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0090.mp3|the drop given was fourteen feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0092.mp3|that must never be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0093.mp3|she could not stand that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0094.mp3|the thought of it even was not bearable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0095.mp3|she could not stand thinking of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0097.mp3|this time she managed to refasten her veil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0098.mp3|with her face as if masked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0099.mp3|all black from head to foot except for some flowers in her hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0100.mp3|she looked up mechanically at the clock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0101.mp3|she thought it must have stopped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0102.mp3|she could not believe that only two minutes had passed since she had looked at it last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0103.mp3|of course not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0104.mp3|it had been stopped all the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0105.mp3|as a matter of fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0106.mp3|only three minutes had elapsed from the moment she had drawn the first deep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0107.mp3|easy breath after the blow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0110.mp3|she seemed to have heard or read that clocks and watches always stopped at the moment of murder for the undoing of the murderer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0111.mp3|she did not care|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0112.mp3|to the bridge and over i go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0113.mp3|but her movements were slow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0114.mp3|she dragged herself painfully across the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0115.mp3|and had to hold on to the handle of the door before she found the necessary fortitude to open it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0116.mp3|the street frightened her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0117.mp3|since it led either to the gallows or to the river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0119.mp3|arms thrown out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0120.mp3|like a person falling over the parapet of a bridge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0121.mp3|this entrance into the open air had a foretaste of drowning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0122.mp3|a slimy dampness enveloped her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0123.mp3|entered her nostrils|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0124.mp3|clung to her hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0125.mp3|it was not actually raining|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0126.mp3|but each gas lamp had a rusty little halo of mist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0127.mp3|the van and horses were gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0130.mp3|dragging herself slowly towards it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0131.mp3|thought that she was a very friendless woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0132.mp3|it was true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0133.mp3|it was so true that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0134.mp3|in a sudden longing to see some friendly face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0137.mp3|she had no acquaintances of her own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0138.mp3|nobody would miss her in a social way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0139.mp3|it must not be imagined that the widow verloc had forgotten her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0140.mp3|this was not so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0141.mp3|winnie had been a good daughter because she had been a devoted sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0142.mp3|her mother had always leaned on her for support|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0144.mp3|now that stevie was dead the bond seemed to be broken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0145.mp3|she could not face the old woman with the horrible tale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0146.mp3|moreover it was too far|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0147.mp3|the river was her present destination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0149.mp3|each step cost her an effort of will which seemed the last possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0151.mp3|to the bridge and over i go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0152.mp3|she repeated to herself with fierce obstinacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0153.mp3|she put out her hand just in time to steady herself against a lamp post|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0154.mp3|i'll never get there before morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0157.mp3|it seemed to her she had been staggering in that street for hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0158.mp3|i'll never get there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0159.mp3|she thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0160.mp3|they'll find me knocking about the streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0161.mp3|it's too far|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0162.mp3|she held on panting under her black veil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0163.mp3|the drop given was fourteen feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0164.mp3|she pushed the lamp post away from her violently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0165.mp3|and found herself walking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0166.mp3|but another wave of faintness overtook her like a great sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0167.mp3|washing away her heart clean out of her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0169.mp3|she muttered suddenly arrested swaying lightly where she stood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0171.mp3|and perceiving the utter impossibility of walking as far as the nearest bridge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0173.mp3|it came to her suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0174.mp3|murderers escaped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0175.mp3|they escaped abroad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0176.mp3|spain or california|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0179.mp3|she did not know which way to turn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0180.mp3|murderers had friends relations helpers they had knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0181.mp3|she had nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0182.mp3|she was the most lonely of murderers that ever struck a mortal blow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0183.mp3|she was alone in london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0184.mp3|and the whole town of marvels and mud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0186.mp3|was sunk in a hopeless night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0187.mp3|rested at the bottom of a black abyss from which no unaided woman could hope to scramble out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0188.mp3|she swayed forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0189.mp3|and made a fresh start blindly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0190.mp3|with an awful dread of falling down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0191.mp3|but at the end of a few steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0192.mp3|unexpectedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0193.mp3|she found a sensation of support|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0194.mp3|of security|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0195.mp3|raising her head she saw a man's face peering closely at her veil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0197.mp3|and no feeling of false delicacy could prevent him from striking an acquaintance with a woman apparently very much intoxicated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0199.mp3|he held up this one between his two large palms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0200.mp3|peering at her in a business like way till he heard her say faintly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0202.mp3|and then he very nearly let her drop to the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0204.mp3|he exclaimed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0206.mp3|it seemed impossible to him that she should have been drinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0207.mp3|but one never knows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0208.mp3|he did not go into that question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0209.mp3|but attentive not to discourage kind fate surrendering to him the widow of comrade verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0210.mp3|he tried to draw her to his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0211.mp3|to his astonishment she came quite easily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0212.mp3|and even rested on his arm for a moment before she attempted to disengage herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0214.mp3|he withdrew his arm in a natural way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0216.mp3|she faltered out standing before him fairly steady on her legs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0217.mp3|of course i did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0219.mp3|i was afraid you were going to fall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0222.mp3|i've always thought of you ever since i first set eyes on you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0224.mp3|you were coming to the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0225.mp3|she said nervously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0226.mp3|yes at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0228.mp3|directly i read the paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0231.mp3|unable to make up his mind for a bold move|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0232.mp3|the robust anarchist was not exactly a bold conqueror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0234.mp3|besides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0235.mp3|he thought the shop might be watched by the police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0237.mp3|even now he did not know precisely what to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0238.mp3|in comparison with his usual amatory speculations this was a big and serious undertaking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0239.mp3|he ignored how much there was in it and how far he would have to go in order to get hold of what there was to get supposing there was a chance at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0242.mp3|he inquired in a subdued voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0243.mp3|don't ask me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0245.mp3|all her strong vitality recoiled from the idea of death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0246.mp3|never mind where i was going|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0249.mp3|then all at once she did something which he did not expect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0250.mp3|she slipped her hand under his arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0251.mp3|he was startled by the act itself certainly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0252.mp3|and quite as much too by the palpably resolute character of this movement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0253.mp3|but this being a delicate affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0255.mp3|he contented himself by pressing the hand slightly against his robust ribs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0256.mp3|at the same time he felt himself being impelled forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0257.mp3|and yielded to the impulse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0258.mp3|at the end of brett street he became aware of being directed to the left|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0259.mp3|he submitted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0260.mp3|the fruiterer at the corner had put out the blazing glory of his oranges and lemons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0261.mp3|and brett place was all darkness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0262.mp3|interspersed with the misty halos of the few lamps defining its triangular shape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0263.mp3|with a cluster of three lights on one stand in the middle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0265.mp3|what would you say if i were to tell you that i was going to find you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0270.mp3|the progress of this delicate affair was almost taking his breath away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0271.mp3|in my trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0273.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0274.mp3|and do you know what my trouble is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0275.mp3|she whispered with strange intensity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0276.mp3|ten minutes after seeing the evening paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0279.mp3|and i had a talk with him which left no doubt whatever in my mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0280.mp3|then i started for here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0281.mp3|wondering whether you i've been fond of you beyond words ever since i set eyes on your face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0282.mp3|he cried as if unable to command his feelings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0286.mp3|they walked slowly in step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0287.mp3|i thought so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0289.mp3|you've read it in my eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0291.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0292.mp3|she breathed out into his inclined ear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0293.mp3|a love like mine could not be concealed from a woman like you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0294.mp3|he went on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0295.mp3|trying to detach his mind from material considerations such as the business value of the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0296.mp3|and the amount of money mister verloc might have left in the bank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0297.mp3|he applied himself to the sentimental side of the affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0298.mp3|in his heart of hearts he was a little shocked at his success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0299.mp3|verloc had been a good fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0300.mp3|and certainly a very decent husband as far as one could see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0301.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0303.mp3|resolutely he suppressed his sympathy for the ghost of comrade verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0305.mp3|i could not conceal it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0306.mp3|i was too full of you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0308.mp3|but i could not guess it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0310.mp3|what else did you expect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0312.mp3|i was a respectable woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0314.mp3|then added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0315.mp3|as if speaking to herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0316.mp3|in sinister resentment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0317.mp3|till he made me what i am|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0319.mp3|he never did seem to me to be quite worthy of you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0320.mp3|he began throwing loyalty to the winds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0321.mp3|you were worthy of a better fate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0323.mp3|better fate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0324.mp3|he cheated me out of seven years of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0325.mp3|you seemed to live so happily with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0327.mp3|it's that what's made me timid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0328.mp3|you seemed to love him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0329.mp3|i was surprised and jealous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0334.mp3|i was a good wife to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0335.mp3|i am a respectable woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0336.mp3|you thought i loved him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0338.mp3|look here tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0340.mp3|for his name was alexander|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0341.mp3|and he was called tom by arrangement with the most familiar of his intimates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0342.mp3|it was a name of friendship of moments of expansion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0343.mp3|he had no idea that she had ever heard it used by anybody|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0344.mp3|it was apparent that she had not only caught it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0345.mp3|but had treasured it in her memory perhaps in her heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0346.mp3|look here tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0347.mp3|i was a young girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0348.mp3|i was done up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0349.mp3|i was tired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0350.mp3|i had two people depending on what i could do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0351.mp3|and it did seem as if i couldn't do any more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0352.mp3|two people mother and the boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0353.mp3|he was much more mine than mother's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0355.mp3|all alone upstairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0356.mp3|when i wasn't more than eight years old myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0357.mp3|and then he was mine i tell you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0358.mp3|you can't understand that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0359.mp3|no man can understand it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0360.mp3|what was i to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0361.mp3|there was a young fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0362.mp3|the memory of the early romance with the young butcher survived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0364.mp3|like the image of a glimpsed ideal in that heart quailing before the fear of the gallows and full of revolt against death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0365.mp3|that was the man i loved then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0366.mp3|went on the widow of mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0367.mp3|i suppose he could see it in my eyes too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0368.mp3|five and twenty shillings a week|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0370.mp3|but he would hang about me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0371.mp3|till one evening i found the courage to slam the door in his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0372.mp3|i had to do it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0373.mp3|i loved him dearly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0374.mp3|five and twenty shillings a week|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0375.mp3|there was that other man a good lodger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0376.mp3|what is a girl to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0378.mp3|he seemed kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0379.mp3|he wanted me anyhow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0380.mp3|what was i to do with mother and that poor boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0382.mp3|i said yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0383.mp3|he seemed good natured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0385.mp3|he had money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0386.mp3|he never said anything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0387.mp3|seven years seven years a good wife to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0390.mp3|the generous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0391.mp3|the and he loved me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0392.mp3|oh yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0393.mp3|he loved me till i sometimes wished myself seven years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0394.mp3|seven years a wife to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0396.mp3|do you know what he was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0397.mp3|he was a devil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0398.mp3|the superhuman vehemence of that whispered statement completely stunned comrade ossipon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0399.mp3|winnie verloc turning about held him by both arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0401.mp3|in which all sounds of life seemed lost as if in a triangular well of asphalt and bricks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0402.mp3|of blind houses and unfeeling stones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0403.mp3|no i didn't know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0404.mp3|he declared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0405.mp3|with a sort of flabby stupidity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0406.mp3|whose comical aspect was lost upon a woman haunted by the fear of the gallows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0407.mp3|but i do now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0408.mp3|i i understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0409.mp3|he floundered on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0412.mp3|it was positively awful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0413.mp3|i understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0414.mp3|he repeated and then by a sudden inspiration uttered an|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0415.mp3|unhappy woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0416.mp3|of lofty commiseration instead of the more familiar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0417.mp3|poor darling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0418.mp3|of his usual practice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0419.mp3|this was no usual case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0420.mp3|he felt conscious of something abnormal going on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0421.mp3|while he never lost sight of the greatness of the stake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0422.mp3|unhappy brave woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0423.mp3|he was glad to have discovered that variation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0424.mp3|but he could discover nothing else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0425.mp3|ah but he is dead now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0426.mp3|was the best he could do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0427.mp3|and he put a remarkable amount of animosity into his guarded exclamation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0429.mp3|you guessed then he was dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0430.mp3|she murmured as if beside herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0432.mp3|you guessed what i had to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0434.mp3|there were suggestions of triumph|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0436.mp3|gratitude in the indefinable tone of these words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0438.mp3|he wondered what was up with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0439.mp3|why she had worked herself into this state of wild excitement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0441.mp3|he went so far as to suspect mister verloc of having selected that extraordinary manner of committing suicide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0442.mp3|by jove|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0443.mp3|that would account for the utter inanity and wrong headedness of the thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0444.mp3|no anarchist manifestation was required by the circumstances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0445.mp3|quite the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0446.mp3|and verloc was as well aware of that as any other revolutionist of his standing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0447.mp3|what an immense joke if verloc had simply made fools of the whole of europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0448.mp3|of the revolutionary world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0449.mp3|of the police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0452.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0455.mp3|it seemed almost certain that he did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0456.mp3|poor beggar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0457.mp3|it struck him as very possible that of that household of two it wasn't precisely the man who was the devil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0459.mp3|nicknamed the doctor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0460.mp3|was naturally inclined to think indulgently of his men friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0462.mp3|of his women friends he thought in a specially practical way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0464.mp3|which was no guess at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0465.mp3|did not disturb him beyond measure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0466.mp3|they often talked like lunatics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0467.mp3|but he was curious to know how she had been informed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0468.mp3|the papers could tell her nothing beyond the mere fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0469.mp3|the man blown to pieces in greenwich park not having been identified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0470.mp3|it was inconceivable on any theory that verloc should have given her an inkling of his intention whatever it was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0472.mp3|he stopped short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0473.mp3|they had gone then along the three sides of brett place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0474.mp3|and were near the end of brett street again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0476.mp3|he asked in a tone he tried to render appropriate to the character of the revelations which had been made to him by the woman at his side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0477.mp3|she shook violently for a while before she answered in a listless voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0478.mp3|from the police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0480.mp3|he showed me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0482.mp3|oh tom they had to gather him up with a shovel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0483.mp3|her breast heaved with dry sobs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0486.mp3|do you mean to say the police came already|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0488.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0489.mp3|she confirmed in the same listless tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0491.mp3|he came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0492.mp3|i didn't know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0493.mp3|he showed me a piece of overcoat and just like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0495.mp3|he says|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0498.mp3|and what did he do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0501.mp3|he did nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0502.mp3|he went away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0503.mp3|the police were on that man's side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0504.mp3|she murmured tragically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0505.mp3|another one came too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0506.mp3|another another inspector do you mean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0509.mp3|and very much in the tone of a scared child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0510.mp3|i don't know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0511.mp3|he came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0517.mp3|what embassy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0518.mp3|what on earth do you mean by embassy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0519.mp3|it's that place in chesham square|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0521.mp3|i don't know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0522.mp3|what does it matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0524.mp3|i don't remember|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0526.mp3|i don't care|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0527.mp3|don't ask me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0528.mp3|she pleaded in a weary voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0529.mp3|all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0530.mp3|i won't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0532.mp3|and he meant it too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0534.mp3|but because he felt himself losing his footing in the depths of this tenebrous affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0538.mp3|for fear of adventuring his intelligence into ways where its natural lights might fail to guide it safely he dismissed resolutely all suppositions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0540.mp3|and theories out of his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0541.mp3|he had the woman there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0542.mp3|absolutely flinging herself at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0543.mp3|and that was the principal consideration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0544.mp3|but after what he had heard nothing could astonish him any more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0546.mp3|as if startled suddenly out of a dream of safety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0547.mp3|began to urge upon him wildly the necessity of an immediate flight on the continent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0548.mp3|he did not exclaim in the least|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0549.mp3|he simply said with unaffected regret that there was no train till the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0550.mp3|and stood looking thoughtfully at her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0551.mp3|veiled in black net|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0552.mp3|in the light of a gas lamp veiled in a gauze of mist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0554.mp3|her black form merged in the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0555.mp3|like a figure half chiselled out of a block of black stone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0556.mp3|it was impossible to say what she knew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0557.mp3|how deep she was involved with policemen and embassies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0558.mp3|but if she wanted to get away it was not for him to object|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0559.mp3|he was anxious to be off himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0560.mp3|he felt that the business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0561.mp3|the shop so strangely familiar to chief inspectors and members of foreign embassies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0562.mp3|was not the place for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0563.mp3|that must be dropped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0564.mp3|but there was the rest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0565.mp3|these savings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0566.mp3|the money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0567.mp3|you must hide me till the morning somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0568.mp3|she said in a dismayed voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0569.mp3|fact is my dear i can't take you where i live|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0570.mp3|i share the room with a friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0571.mp3|he was somewhat dismayed himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0573.mp3|no doubt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0574.mp3|and if they once got hold of her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0575.mp3|for one reason or another she would be lost to him indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0576.mp3|but you must|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0577.mp3|don't you care for me at all at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0578.mp3|what are you thinking of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0579.mp3|she said this violently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0580.mp3|but she let her clasped hands fall in discouragement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0581.mp3|there was a silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0582.mp3|while the mist fell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0583.mp3|and darkness reigned undisturbed over brett place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0584.mp3|not a soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0585.mp3|not even the vagabond|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0588.mp3|came near the man and the woman facing each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0589.mp3|it would be possible perhaps to find a safe lodging somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0592.mp3|my dear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0593.mp3|i have not enough money to go and try with only a few pence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0594.mp3|we revolutionists are not rich|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0595.mp3|he had fifteen shillings in his pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0596.mp3|he added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0597.mp3|and there's the journey before us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0599.mp3|she did not move|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0600.mp3|made no sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0602.mp3|apparently she had no suggestion to offer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0603.mp3|suddenly she clutched at her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0604.mp3|as if she had felt a sharp pain there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0605.mp3|but i have|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0606.mp3|she gasped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0607.mp3|i have the money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0608.mp3|i have enough money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0610.mp3|let us go from here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0611.mp3|how much have you got|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0612.mp3|he inquired without stirring to her tug for he was a cautious man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0613.mp3|i have the money i tell you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0614.mp3|all the money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0615.mp3|what do you mean by it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0617.mp3|he asked incredulously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0618.mp3|but ready not to be surprised at anything in the way of luck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0619.mp3|yes yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0620.mp3|she said nervously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0623.mp3|how on earth did you manage to get hold of it already|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0624.mp3|he marvelled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0625.mp3|he gave it to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0626.mp3|she murmured suddenly subdued and trembling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0629.mp3|he uttered slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0630.mp3|she leaned forward and sank against his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0631.mp3|he welcomed her there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0632.mp3|she had all the money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0633.mp3|her hat was in the way of very marked effusion her veil too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0634.mp3|he was adequate in his manifestations but no more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0635.mp3|she received them without resistance and without abandonment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0636.mp3|passively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0637.mp3|as if only half sensible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0638.mp3|she freed herself from his lax embraces without difficulty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0639.mp3|you will save me tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0642.mp3|but still keeping her hold on him by the two lapels of his damp coat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0645.mp3|don't let them have me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0646.mp3|you must kill me first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0647.mp3|i couldn't do it myself i couldn't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0648.mp3|i couldn't not even for what i am afraid of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0649.mp3|she was confoundedly bizarre he thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0650.mp3|she was beginning to inspire him with an indefinite uneasiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0651.mp3|he said surlily for he was busy with important thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0652.mp3|what the devil are you afraid of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0653.mp3|haven't you guessed what i was driven to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0654.mp3|cried the woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0655.mp3|distracted by the vividness of her dreadful apprehensions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0656.mp3|her head ringing with forceful words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0657.mp3|that kept the horror of her position before her mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0658.mp3|she had imagined her incoherence to be clearness itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0659.mp3|she had no conscience of how little she had audibly said in the disjointed phrases completed only in her thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0660.mp3|she had felt the relief of a full confession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0662.mp3|whose knowledge did not in the least resemble her own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0663.mp3|haven't you guessed what i was driven to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0664.mp3|her voice fell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0666.mp3|she continued in a bitter and sombre murmur|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0667.mp3|i won't have it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0671.mp3|you must promise to kill me first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0672.mp3|she shook the lapels of his coat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0673.mp3|it must never be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0674.mp3|he assured her curtly that no promises on his part were necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0675.mp3|but he took good care not to contradict her in set terms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0676.mp3|because he had had much to do with excited women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0677.mp3|and he was inclined in general to let his experience guide his conduct in preference to applying his sagacity to each special case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0678.mp3|his sagacity in this case was busy in other directions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0679.mp3|women's words fell into water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0680.mp3|but the shortcomings of time tables remained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0681.mp3|the insular nature of great britain obtruded itself upon his notice in an odious form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0682.mp3|might just as well be put under lock and key every night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0683.mp3|he thought irritably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0685.mp3|suddenly he slapped his forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0687.mp3|the boat left about midnight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0689.mp3|he became cheery and ready to act|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0690.mp3|from waterloo|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0691.mp3|plenty of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0692.mp3|we are all right after all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0693.mp3|what's the matter now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0694.mp3|this isn't the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0695.mp3|he protested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0697.mp3|having hooked her arm into his|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0698.mp3|was trying to drag him into brett street again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0699.mp3|i've forgotten to shut the shop door as i went out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0700.mp3|she whispered terribly agitated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0702.mp3|he knew how to limit his desires|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0703.mp3|he was on the point of saying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0705.mp3|let it be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0706.mp3|but he refrained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0707.mp3|he disliked argument about trifles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0708.mp3|he even mended his pace considerably on the thought that she might have left the money in the drawer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_13_conrad_0709.mp3|but his willingness lagged behind her feverish impatience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0001.mp3|the door stood ajar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0003.mp3|nobody has been in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0004.mp3|look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0005.mp3|the light the light in the parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0007.mp3|stretching his head forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0008.mp3|saw a faint gleam in the darkness of the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0009.mp3|there is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0010.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0011.mp3|i forgot it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0014.mp3|go in and put it out or i'll go mad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0015.mp3|he made no immediate objection to this proposal so strangely motived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0016.mp3|where's all that money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0017.mp3|he asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0018.mp3|on me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0022.mp3|go in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0023.mp3|she cried seizing him by both shoulders from behind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0024.mp3|not prepared for a display of physical force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0026.mp3|he was astonished at the strength of the woman and scandalised by her proceedings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0027.mp3|but he did not retrace his steps in order to remonstrate with her severely in the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0028.mp3|he was beginning to be disagreeably impressed by her fantastic behaviour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0029.mp3|moreover this or never was the time to humour the woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0031.mp3|and approached calmly the glazed door of the parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0032.mp3|the curtain over the panes being drawn back a little he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0033.mp3|by a very natural impulse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0034.mp3|looked in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0035.mp3|just as he made ready to turn the handle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0036.mp3|he looked in without a thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0037.mp3|without intention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0038.mp3|without curiosity of any sort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0039.mp3|he looked in because he could not help looking in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0040.mp3|he looked in and discovered mister verloc reposing quietly on the sofa|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0042.mp3|sickly taste on his lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0044.mp3|but his body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0045.mp3|left thus without intellectual guidance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0046.mp3|held on to the door handle with the unthinking force of an instinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0047.mp3|the robust anarchist did not even totter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0048.mp3|and he stared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0049.mp3|his face close to the glass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0050.mp3|his eyes protruding out of his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0051.mp3|he would have given anything to get away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0052.mp3|but his returning reason informed him that it would not do to let go the door handle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0053.mp3|what was it madness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0054.mp3|a nightmare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0055.mp3|or a trap into which he had been decoyed with fiendish artfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0056.mp3|why what for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0057.mp3|he did not know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0058.mp3|without any sense of guilt in his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0059.mp3|in the full peace of his conscience as far as these people were concerned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0060.mp3|the idea that he would be murdered for mysterious reasons by the couple verloc passed not so much across his mind as across the pit of his stomach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0061.mp3|and went out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0065.mp3|mister verloc lay very still meanwhile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0066.mp3|simulating sleep for reasons of his own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0067.mp3|while that savage woman of his was guarding the door invisible and silent in the dark and deserted street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0069.mp3|his modesty shrank from that explanation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0071.mp3|it seemed an extraordinary thing an ominous object a sign|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0073.mp3|and rim upward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0075.mp3|from the hat the eyes of the robust anarchist wandered to the displaced table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0076.mp3|gazed at the broken dish for a time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0077.mp3|received a kind of optical shock from observing a white gleam under the imperfectly closed eyelids of the man on the couch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0078.mp3|mister verloc did not seem so much asleep now as lying down with a bent head and looking insistently at his left breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0081.mp3|the crash of the street door flung to made his very soul leap in a panic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0082.mp3|this house with its harmless tenant could still be made a trap of a trap of a terrible kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0084.mp3|catching his thigh against the end of the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0085.mp3|he spun round|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0086.mp3|staggered with a cry of pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0087.mp3|felt in the distracting clatter of the bell his arms pinned to his side by a convulsive hug|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0088.mp3|while the cold lips of a woman moved creepily on his very ear to form the words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0090.mp3|he has seen me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0091.mp3|he ceased to struggle she never let him go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0093.mp3|while the footsteps approached|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0094.mp3|they breathed quickly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0097.mp3|laboured breaths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0101.mp3|it was the attitude of deadly fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0102.mp3|and the time was long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0104.mp3|only coming from the lighted thoroughfare at the other end of brett street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0105.mp3|she had been no more to him than a flutter in the darkness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0106.mp3|and he was not even quite sure that there had been a flutter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0107.mp3|he had no reason to hurry up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0108.mp3|on coming abreast of the shop he observed that it had been closed early|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0109.mp3|there was nothing very unusual in that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0110.mp3|the men on duty had special instructions about that shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0111.mp3|what went on about there was not to be meddled with unless absolutely disorderly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0112.mp3|but any observations made were to be reported|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0113.mp3|there were no observations to make|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0114.mp3|but from a sense of duty and for the peace of his conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0115.mp3|owing also to that doubtful flutter of the darkness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0117.mp3|and tried the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0118.mp3|the spring latch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0119.mp3|whose key was reposing for ever off duty in the late mister verloc's waistcoat pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0120.mp3|held as well as usual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0121.mp3|while the conscientious officer was shaking the handle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0123.mp3|if he comes in kill me kill me tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0124.mp3|the constable moved away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0125.mp3|flashing as he passed the light of his dark lantern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0126.mp3|merely for form's sake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0127.mp3|at the shop window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0131.mp3|then her fingers came unlocked her arms fell by her side slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0133.mp3|the robust anarchist wanted support badly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0134.mp3|this was awful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0135.mp3|he was almost too disgusted for speech|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0136.mp3|yet he managed to utter a plaintive thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0138.mp3|only a couple of minutes later and you'd have made me blunder against the fellow poking about here with his damned dark lantern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0139.mp3|the widow of mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0140.mp3|motionless in the middle of the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0141.mp3|said insistently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0142.mp3|go in and put that light out tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0143.mp3|it will drive me crazy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0144.mp3|she saw vaguely his vehement gesture of refusal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0146.mp3|he was not superstitious but there was too much blood on the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0147.mp3|a beastly pool of it all round the hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0150.mp3|at the meter then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0152.mp3|look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0153.mp3|in that corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0156.mp3|squatted in a corner obediently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0157.mp3|but this obedience was without grace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0159.mp3|hysterical sigh of a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0161.mp3|the inevitable reward of men's faithful labours on this earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0162.mp3|night had fallen on mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0163.mp3|the tried revolutionist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0164.mp3|one of the old lot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0165.mp3|the humble guardian of society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0167.mp3|a servant of law and order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0169.mp3|trusted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0172.mp3|with perhaps one single amiable weakness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0173.mp3|the idealistic belief in being loved for himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0175.mp3|as black as ink now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0176.mp3|to the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0178.mp3|standing in the middle of the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0180.mp3|i will not be hanged tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0181.mp3|i will not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0182.mp3|she broke off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0184.mp3|don't shout like this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0185.mp3|then seemed to reflect profoundly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0186.mp3|you did this thing quite by yourself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0187.mp3|he inquired in a hollow voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0189.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0190.mp3|she whispered invisible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0191.mp3|i wouldn't have believed it possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0192.mp3|he muttered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0193.mp3|nobody would|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0194.mp3|she heard him move about and the snapping of a lock in the parlour door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0196.mp3|and this he did not from reverence for its eternal nature or any other obscurely sentimental consideration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0198.mp3|he did not believe the woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0199.mp3|or rather he was incapable by now of judging what could be true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0201.mp3|or even probable in this astounding universe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0202.mp3|he was terrified out of all capacity for belief or disbelief in regard of this extraordinary affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0204.mp3|he was terrified at the thought that he could not prove the use he made of his time ever since seven o'clock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0205.mp3|for he had been skulking about brett street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0206.mp3|he was terrified at this savage woman who had brought him in there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0207.mp3|and would probably saddle him with complicity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0208.mp3|at least if he were not careful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0209.mp3|he was terrified at the rapidity with which he had been involved in such dangers decoyed into it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0210.mp3|it was some twenty minutes since he had met her not more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0212.mp3|don't let them hang me tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0213.mp3|take me out of the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0214.mp3|i'll work for you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0218.mp3|who would look at me if you don't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0219.mp3|she ceased for a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0220.mp3|then in the depths of the loneliness made round her by an insignificant thread of blood trickling off the handle of a knife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0221.mp3|she found a dreadful inspiration to her who had been the respectable girl of the belgravian mansion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0222.mp3|the loyal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0223.mp3|respectable wife of mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0224.mp3|i won't ask you to marry me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0226.mp3|she moved a step forward in the darkness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0227.mp3|he was terrified at her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0228.mp3|he would not have been surprised if she had suddenly produced another knife destined for his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0229.mp3|he certainly would have made no resistance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0230.mp3|he had really not enough fortitude in him just then to tell her to keep back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0231.mp3|but he inquired in a cavernous strange tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0232.mp3|was he asleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0233.mp3|no|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0234.mp3|she cried and went on rapidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0235.mp3|he wasn't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0236.mp3|not he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0237.mp3|he had been telling me that nothing could touch him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0241.mp3|my own i tell you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0242.mp3|he was lying on the couch quite easy after killing the boy my boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0243.mp3|i would have gone on the streets to get out of his sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0244.mp3|and he says to me like this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0246.mp3|you hear tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0247.mp3|he says like this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0249.mp3|she ceased then dreamily repeated twice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0253.mp3|it was that half witted lad then who had perished in the park|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0254.mp3|and the fooling of everybody all round appeared more complete than ever colossal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0255.mp3|he exclaimed scientifically in the extremity of his astonishment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0256.mp3|the degenerate by heavens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0257.mp3|come here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0259.mp3|what did he think i was made of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0260.mp3|tell me tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0261.mp3|come here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0264.mp3|i had been looking at the knife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0265.mp3|and i thought i would come then if he wanted me so much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0267.mp3|i came for the last time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0269.mp3|he was excessively terrified at her the sister of the degenerate a degenerate herself of a murdering type|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0270.mp3|or else of the lying type|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0272.mp3|it was an immeasurable and composite funk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0273.mp3|which from its very excess gave him in the dark a false appearance of calm and thoughtful deliberation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0274.mp3|for he moved and spoke with difficulty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0275.mp3|being as if half frozen in his will and mind and no one could see his ghastly face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0276.mp3|he felt half dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0277.mp3|he leaped a foot high|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0281.mp3|i won't be hanged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0282.mp3|he rushed forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0284.mp3|and the shriek died out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0285.mp3|but in his rush he had knocked her over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0286.mp3|he felt her now clinging round his legs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0287.mp3|and his terror reached its culminating point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0288.mp3|became a sort of intoxication|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0289.mp3|entertained delusions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0290.mp3|acquired the characteristics of delirium tremens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0291.mp3|he positively saw snakes now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0292.mp3|he saw the woman twined round him like a snake not to be shaken off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0293.mp3|she was not deadly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0294.mp3|she was death itself the companion of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0296.mp3|as if relieved by the outburst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0297.mp3|was very far from behaving noisily now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0298.mp3|she was pitiful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0299.mp3|tom you can't throw me off now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0300.mp3|she murmured from the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0301.mp3|not unless you crush my head under your heel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0302.mp3|i won't leave you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0303.mp3|get up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0305.mp3|his face was so pale as to be quite visible in the profound black darkness of the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0307.mp3|the trembling of something small and white|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0308.mp3|a flower in her hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0309.mp3|marked her place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0310.mp3|her movements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0311.mp3|it rose in the blackness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0312.mp3|she had got up from the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0314.mp3|but he perceived easily that it would not do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0315.mp3|it would not do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0316.mp3|she would run after him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0317.mp3|she would pursue him shrieking till she sent every policeman within hearing in chase|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0318.mp3|and then goodness only knew what she would say of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0319.mp3|he was so frightened that for a moment the insane notion of strangling her in the dark passed through his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0320.mp3|and he became more frightened than ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0321.mp3|she had him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0322.mp3|he saw himself living in abject terror in some obscure hamlet in spain or italy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0323.mp3|till some fine morning they found him dead too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0324.mp3|with a knife in his breast like mister verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0325.mp3|he sighed deeply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0326.mp3|he dared not move|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0328.mp3|deriving comfort from his reflective silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0329.mp3|suddenly he spoke up in an almost natural voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0330.mp3|his reflections had come to an end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0331.mp3|let's get out or we will lose the train|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0332.mp3|where are we going to tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0333.mp3|she asked timidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0335.mp3|let's get to paris first the best way we can|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0337.mp3|she obeyed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0338.mp3|her voice came subdued through the cautiously opened door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0339.mp3|it's all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0341.mp3|notwithstanding his endeavours to be gentle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0342.mp3|the cracked bell clattered behind the closed door in the empty shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0343.mp3|as if trying in vain to warn the reposing mister verloc of the final departure of his wife accompanied by his friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0344.mp3|in the hansom they presently picked up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0345.mp3|the robust anarchist became explanatory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0346.mp3|he was still awfully pale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0347.mp3|with eyes that seemed to have sunk a whole half inch into his tense face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0348.mp3|but he seemed to have thought of everything with extraordinary method|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0349.mp3|when we arrive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0350.mp3|he discoursed in a queer monotonous tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0351.mp3|you must go into the station ahead of me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0352.mp3|as if we did not know each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0356.mp3|and sit there till ten minutes before the train starts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0357.mp3|then you come out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0358.mp3|i will be outside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0360.mp3|there may be eyes watching there that know what's what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0361.mp3|alone you are only a woman going off by train|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0362.mp3|i am known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0364.mp3|do you understand my dear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0365.mp3|he added with an effort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0366.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0368.mp3|sitting there against him in the hansom all rigid with the dread of the gallows and the fear of death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0369.mp3|yes tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0370.mp3|and she added to herself like an awful refrain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0373.mp3|not looking at her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0374.mp3|and with a face like a fresh plaster cast of himself after a wasting illness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0375.mp3|said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0376.mp3|by the by i ought to have the money for the tickets now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0379.mp3|while she went on staring ahead beyond the splashboard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0380.mp3|handed over to him the new pigskin pocket book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0381.mp3|he received it without a word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0382.mp3|and seemed to plunge it deep somewhere into his very breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0383.mp3|then he slapped his coat on the outside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0384.mp3|all this was done without the exchange of a single glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0385.mp3|they were like two people looking out for the first sight of a desired goal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0387.mp3|do you know how much money there is in that thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0388.mp3|he asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0390.mp3|no|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0392.mp3|he gave it to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0393.mp3|i didn't count|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0394.mp3|i thought nothing of it at the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0395.mp3|afterwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0396.mp3|she moved her right hand a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0398.mp3|he exaggerated it then purposely and muttered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0400.mp3|i got chilled through|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0402.mp3|now and then like a sable streamer blown across a road the words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0403.mp3|the drop given was fourteen feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0404.mp3|got in the way of her tense stare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0405.mp3|through her black veil the whites of her big eyes gleamed lustrously like the eyes of a masked woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0407.mp3|a queer official expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0408.mp3|he was heard again all of a sudden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0409.mp3|as though he had released a catch in order to speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0414.mp3|she said thoughtfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0415.mp3|be exact in what you say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0417.mp3|it's extremely important|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0418.mp3|i will explain to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0419.mp3|the bank has the numbers of these notes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0420.mp3|if they were paid to him in his own name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0421.mp3|then when his his death becomes known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0422.mp3|the notes may serve to track us since we have no other money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0423.mp3|you have no other money on you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0424.mp3|she shook her head negatively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0425.mp3|none whatever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0426.mp3|he insisted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0427.mp3|a few coppers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0428.mp3|it would be dangerous in that case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0429.mp3|the money would have then to be dealt specially with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0430.mp3|very specially|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0433.mp3|for instance the money is perfectly safe to use|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0434.mp3|you understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0435.mp3|the bank has no means of knowing that mister verloc and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0438.mp3|do you see how important it is that you should make no mistake in answering me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0439.mp3|can you answer that query at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0442.mp3|she said composedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0444.mp3|he didn't bank in his own name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0448.mp3|you don't think the bank had any knowledge of his real name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0449.mp3|or anybody in the bank or|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0450.mp3|she shrugged her shoulders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0451.mp3|how can i know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0452.mp3|is it likely tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0453.mp3|no i suppose it's not likely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0454.mp3|it would have been more comfortable to know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0455.mp3|here we are|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0456.mp3|get out first and walk straight in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0457.mp3|move smartly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0458.mp3|he remained behind and paid the cabman out of his own loose silver|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0459.mp3|the programme traced by his minute foresight was carried out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0465.mp3|trying to drive out a cold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0466.mp3|he explained to the barmaid with a friendly nod and a grimacing smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0467.mp3|then he came out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0468.mp3|bringing out from that festive interlude the face of a man who had drunk at the very fountain of sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0469.mp3|he raised his eyes to the clock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0472.mp3|punctual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0475.mp3|and all black black as commonplace death itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0477.mp3|she passed close to a little group of men who were laughing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0478.mp3|but whose laughter could have been struck dead by a single word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0479.mp3|her walk was indolent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0480.mp3|but her back was straight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0482.mp3|the train was drawn up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0483.mp3|with hardly anybody about its row of open doors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0484.mp3|owing to the time of the year and to the abominable weather there were hardly any passengers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0487.mp3|she got in and he remained on the platform looking about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0488.mp3|she bent forward and in a whisper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0489.mp3|what is it tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0490.mp3|is there any danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0493.mp3|she saw him accost the man in uniform|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0494.mp3|they talked for a while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0495.mp3|she heard the guard say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0496.mp3|very well sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0497.mp3|and saw him touch his cap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0499.mp3|i told him not to let anybody get into our compartment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0500.mp3|she was leaning forward on her seat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0501.mp3|you think of everything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0503.mp3|she asked in a gust of anguish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0504.mp3|lifting her veil brusquely to look at her saviour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0506.mp3|and out of this face the eyes looked on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0507.mp3|big|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0511.mp3|burnt out like two black holes in the white|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0512.mp3|shining globes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0513.mp3|there is no danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0514.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0517.mp3|flying from the gallows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0518.mp3|seemed to be full of force and tenderness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0519.mp3|this devotion deeply moved her and the adamantine face lost the stern rigidity of its terror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0523.mp3|nicknamed the doctor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0524.mp3|author of a medical and improper pamphlet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0526.mp3|was free from the trammels of conventional morality but he submitted to the rule of science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0527.mp3|he was scientific|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0528.mp3|and he gazed scientifically at that woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0529.mp3|the sister of a degenerate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0530.mp3|a degenerate herself of a murdering type|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0531.mp3|he gazed at her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0533.mp3|as an italian peasant recommends himself to his favourite saint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0534.mp3|he gazed scientifically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0535.mp3|he gazed at her cheeks at her nose at her eyes at her ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0540.mp3|he gazed also at her teeth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0541.mp3|not a doubt remained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0542.mp3|a murdering type|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0544.mp3|it was only because on scientific grounds he could not believe that he carried about him such a thing as a soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0545.mp3|but he had in him the scientific spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0546.mp3|which moved him to testify on the platform of a railway station in nervous jerky phrases|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0547.mp3|he was an extraordinary lad that brother of yours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0548.mp3|most interesting to study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0549.mp3|a perfect type in a way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0550.mp3|perfect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0551.mp3|he spoke scientifically in his secret fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0554.mp3|swayed forward with a flicker of light in her sombre eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0555.mp3|like a ray of sunshine heralding a tempest of rain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0557.mp3|she whispered softly with quivering lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0558.mp3|you took a lot of notice of him tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0559.mp3|i loved you for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0562.mp3|giving a voice to his abiding dread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0564.mp3|sickening impatience for the train to start|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0565.mp3|yes he resembled you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0566.mp3|these words were not especially touching or sympathetic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0567.mp3|but the fact of that resemblance insisted upon was enough in itself to act upon her emotions powerfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0568.mp3|with a little faint cry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0569.mp3|and throwing her arms out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0572.mp3|hastily closed the door and looked out to see the time by the station clock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0573.mp3|eight minutes more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0575.mp3|then she recovered somewhat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0576.mp3|and sobbed gently in an abundant fall of tears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0577.mp3|she tried to talk to her saviour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0578.mp3|to the man who was the messenger of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0579.mp3|oh tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0580.mp3|how could i fear to die after he was taken away from me so cruelly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0581.mp3|how could i|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0582.mp3|how could i be such a coward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0583.mp3|she lamented aloud her love of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0584.mp3|that life without grace or charm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0585.mp3|and almost without decency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0586.mp3|but of an exalted faithfulness of purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0587.mp3|even unto murder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0590.mp3|rich in suffering but indigent in words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0591.mp3|the truth the very cry of truth was found in a worn and artificial shape picked up somewhere among the phrases of sham sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0592.mp3|how could i be so afraid of death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0593.mp3|tom i tried|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0595.mp3|i tried to do away with myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0596.mp3|and i couldn't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0598.mp3|i suppose the cup of horrors was not full enough for such as me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0599.mp3|then when you came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0601.mp3|then in a gust of confidence and gratitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0602.mp3|i will live all my days for you tom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0603.mp3|she sobbed out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0604.mp3|go over into the other corner of the carriage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0605.mp3|away from the platform|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0607.mp3|she let her saviour settle her comfortably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0608.mp3|and he watched the coming on of another crisis of weeping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0609.mp3|still more violent than the first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0610.mp3|he watched the symptoms with a sort of medical air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0611.mp3|as if counting seconds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0613.mp3|an involuntary contraction of the upper lip bared his teeth with all the aspect of savage resolution as he felt the train beginning to move|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0617.mp3|stood still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0618.mp3|he felt the train roll quicker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0619.mp3|rumbling heavily to the sound of the woman's loud sobs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0621.mp3|and leaped out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0622.mp3|he had leaped out at the very end of the platform|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0623.mp3|and such was his determination in sticking to his desperate plan that he managed by a sort of miracle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0624.mp3|performed almost in the air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0626.mp3|only then did he find himself rolling head over heels like a shot rabbit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0627.mp3|he was bruised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0630.mp3|and out of breath when he got up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0631.mp3|but he was calm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0632.mp3|and perfectly able to meet the excited crowd of railway men who had gathered round him in a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0633.mp3|he explained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0634.mp3|in gentle and convincing tones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0635.mp3|that his wife had started at a moment's notice for brittany to her dying mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0639.mp3|and he considerably concerned at her state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0640.mp3|that he was trying to cheer her up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0641.mp3|and had absolutely failed to notice at first that the train was moving out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0642.mp3|to the general exclamation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0643.mp3|why didn't you go on to southampton then sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0644.mp3|he objected the inexperience of a young sister in law left alone in the house with three small children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0645.mp3|and her alarm at his absence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0646.mp3|the telegraph offices being closed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0647.mp3|he had acted on impulse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0648.mp3|but i don't think i'll ever try that again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0649.mp3|he concluded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0650.mp3|smiled all round|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0651.mp3|distributed some small change|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0652.mp3|and marched without a limp out of the station|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0656.mp3|refused the offer of a cab|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0657.mp3|i can walk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0658.mp3|he said with a little friendly laugh to the civil driver|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0659.mp3|he could walk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0660.mp3|he walked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0661.mp3|he crossed the bridge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0662.mp3|later on the towers of the abbey saw in their massive immobility the yellow bush of his hair passing under the lamps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0663.mp3|the lights of victoria saw him too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0665.mp3|and the railings of the park|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0668.mp3|a sinister marvel of still shadows and flowing gleams mingling below in a black silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0669.mp3|arrested his attention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0670.mp3|he stood looking over the parapet for a long time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0671.mp3|the clock tower boomed a brazen blast above his drooping head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0672.mp3|he looked up at the dial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0673.mp3|half past twelve of a wild night in the channel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0675.mp3|his robust form was seen that night in distant parts of the enormous town slumbering monstrously on a carpet of mud under a veil of raw mist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0676.mp3|it was seen crossing the streets without life and sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0677.mp3|or diminishing in the interminable straight perspectives of shadowy houses bordering empty roadways lined by strings of gas lamps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0678.mp3|he walked through squares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0681.mp3|commons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0682.mp3|through monotonous streets with unknown names where the dust of humanity settles inert and hopeless out of the stream of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0683.mp3|he walked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0684.mp3|and suddenly turning into a strip of a front garden with a mangy grass plot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0685.mp3|he let himself into a small grimy house with a latch key he took out of his pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0686.mp3|he threw himself down on his bed all dressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0687.mp3|and lay still for a whole quarter of an hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0688.mp3|then he sat up suddenly drawing up his knees and clasping his legs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0689.mp3|the first dawn found him open eyed in that same posture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0690.mp3|this man who could walk so long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0692.mp3|so aimlessly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0693.mp3|without showing a sign of fatigue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0694.mp3|could also remain sitting still for hours without stirring a limb or an eyelid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0695.mp3|but when the late sun sent its rays into the room he unclasped his hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0696.mp3|and fell back on the pillow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0697.mp3|his eyes stared at the ceiling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_14_conrad_0698.mp3|and suddenly they closed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0001.mp3|unsaleable in the ordinary course of business on account of its noble proportions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0003.mp3|the room was large|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0006.mp3|and poor with that poverty suggesting the starvation of every human need except mere bread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0007.mp3|there was nothing on the walls but the paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0009.mp3|soiled with indelible smudges here and there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0010.mp3|and with stains resembling faded maps of uninhabited continents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0012.mp3|holding his head between his fists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0013.mp3|the professor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0014.mp3|dressed in his only suit of shoddy tweeds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0015.mp3|but flapping to and fro on the bare boards a pair of incredibly dilapidated slippers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0017.mp3|he was relating to his robust guest a visit he had lately been paying to the apostle michaelis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0018.mp3|the perfect anarchist had even been unbending a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0019.mp3|the fellow didn't know anything of verloc's death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0020.mp3|of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0021.mp3|he never looks at the newspapers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0022.mp3|they make him too sad he says|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0023.mp3|but never mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0024.mp3|i walked into his cottage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0025.mp3|not a soul anywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0026.mp3|i had to shout half a dozen times before he answered me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0027.mp3|i thought he was fast asleep yet in bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0028.mp3|but not at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0029.mp3|he had been writing his book for four hours already|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0030.mp3|he sat in that tiny cage in a litter of manuscript|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0031.mp3|there was a half eaten raw carrot on the table near him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0032.mp3|his breakfast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0033.mp3|he lives on a diet of raw carrots and a little milk now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0034.mp3|how does he look on it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0036.mp3|angelic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0037.mp3|i picked up a handful of his pages from the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0038.mp3|the poverty of reasoning is astonishing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0039.mp3|he has no logic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0040.mp3|he can't think consecutively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0041.mp3|but that's nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0042.mp3|he has divided his biography into three parts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0044.mp3|hope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0047.mp3|with gardens and flowers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0048.mp3|in which the strong are to devote themselves to the nursing of the weak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0049.mp3|the professor paused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0051.mp3|the weak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0052.mp3|the source of all evil on this earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0053.mp3|he continued with his grim assurance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0054.mp3|i told him that i dreamt of a world like shambles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0055.mp3|where the weak would be taken in hand for utter extermination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0057.mp3|the source of all evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0058.mp3|they are our sinister masters the weak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0059.mp3|the flabby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0060.mp3|the silly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0063.mp3|and the slavish of mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0064.mp3|they have power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0066.mp3|theirs is the kingdom of the earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0067.mp3|exterminate exterminate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0068.mp3|that is the only way of progress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0069.mp3|it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0072.mp3|then the only relatively strong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0073.mp3|you see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0074.mp3|first the blind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0076.mp3|then the halt and the lame and so on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0078.mp3|every vice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0079.mp3|every prejudice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0080.mp3|every convention must meet its doom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0081.mp3|and what remains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0083.mp3|i remain if i am strong enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0084.mp3|asserted the sallow little professor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0085.mp3|whose large ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0086.mp3|thin like membranes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0087.mp3|and standing far out from the sides of his frail skull|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0088.mp3|took on suddenly a deep red tint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0089.mp3|haven't i suffered enough from this oppression of the weak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0090.mp3|he continued forcibly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0091.mp3|then tapping the breast pocket of his jacket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0092.mp3|and yet i am the force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0093.mp3|he went on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0094.mp3|but the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0095.mp3|the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0096.mp3|give me time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0098.mp3|that multitude too stupid to feel either pity or fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0099.mp3|sometimes i think they have everything on their side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0100.mp3|everything even death my own weapon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0104.mp3|this last accepted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0105.mp3|he was jovial that day in his own peculiar way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0107.mp3|beer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0108.mp3|so be it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0110.mp3|he busied himself with putting on his boots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0111.mp3|and talked meanwhile in his curt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0112.mp3|resolute tones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0114.mp3|you look glum and seek even my company|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0115.mp3|i hear that you are seen constantly in places where men utter foolish things over glasses of liquor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0116.mp3|why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0117.mp3|have you abandoned your collection of women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0119.mp3|he stamped one foot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0120.mp3|and picked up his other laced boot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0125.mp3|he smiled to himself grimly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0128.mp3|terrible man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0129.mp3|has ever one of your victims killed herself for you or are your triumphs so far incomplete for blood alone puts a seal on greatness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0131.mp3|death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0132.mp3|look at history|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0133.mp3|you be damned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0135.mp3|why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0136.mp3|let that be the hope of the weak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0137.mp3|whose theology has invented hell for the strong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0139.mp3|you couldn't kill a fly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0140.mp3|but rolling to the feast on the top of the omnibus the professor lost his high spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0141.mp3|the contemplation of the multitudes thronging the pavements extinguished his assurance under a load of doubt and uneasiness which he could only shake off after a period of seclusion in the room with the large cupboard closed by an enormous padlock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0142.mp3|and so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0144.mp3|and so michaelis dreams of a world like a beautiful and cheery hospital|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0145.mp3|just so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0147.mp3|assented the professor sardonically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0150.mp3|you can't heal weakness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0151.mp3|but after all michaelis may not be so far wrong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0152.mp3|in two hundred years doctors will rule the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0153.mp3|science reigns already|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0155.mp3|and all science must culminate at last in the science of healing not the weak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0156.mp3|but the strong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0157.mp3|mankind wants to live to live|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0158.mp3|mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0159.mp3|asserted the professor with a self confident glitter of his iron rimmed spectacles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0160.mp3|does not know what it wants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0161.mp3|but you do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0163.mp3|just now you've been crying for time time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0165.mp3|the doctors will serve you out your time if you are good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0168.mp3|twenty other people into eternity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0170.mp3|it's time that you need|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0171.mp3|you if you met a man who could give you for certain ten years of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0172.mp3|you would call him your master|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0173.mp3|my device is no god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0174.mp3|no master|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0180.mp3|he continued across the street and hopping on to the curbstone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0182.mp3|the professor said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0184.mp3|and when they had established themselves at a little table he developed further this gracious thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0185.mp3|you are not even a doctor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0186.mp3|but you are funny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0188.mp3|prophecy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0189.mp3|what's the good of thinking of what will be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0190.mp3|he raised his glass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0191.mp3|to the destruction of what is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0192.mp3|he said calmly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0193.mp3|he drank and relapsed into his peculiarly close manner of silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0194.mp3|the thought of a mankind as numerous as the sands of the sea shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0195.mp3|as indestructible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0197.mp3|oppressed him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0198.mp3|the sound of exploding bombs was lost in their immensity of passive grains without an echo|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0199.mp3|for instance this verloc affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0200.mp3|who thought of it now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0202.mp3|as if suddenly compelled by some mysterious force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0203.mp3|pulled a much folded newspaper out of his pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0204.mp3|the professor raised his head at the rustle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0205.mp3|what's that paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0207.mp3|he asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0209.mp3|nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0210.mp3|nothing whatever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0212.mp3|i forgot it in my pocket i suppose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0213.mp3|but he did not throw the old thing away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0214.mp3|before returning it to his pocket he stole a glance at the last lines of a paragraph|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0215.mp3|they ran thus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0216.mp3|an impenetrable mystery seems destined to hang for ever over this act of madness or despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0217.mp3|such were the end words of an item of news headed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0218.mp3|suicide of lady passenger from a cross channel boat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0220.mp3|an impenetrable mystery seems destined to hang for ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0221.mp3|he knew every word by heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0222.mp3|an impenetrable mystery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0223.mp3|and the robust anarchist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0224.mp3|hanging his head on his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0225.mp3|fell into a long reverie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0226.mp3|he was menaced by this thing in the very sources of his existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0227.mp3|he could not issue forth to meet his various conquests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0228.mp3|those that he courted on benches in kensington gardens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0229.mp3|and those he met near area railings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0230.mp3|without the dread of beginning to talk to them of an impenetrable mystery destined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0233.mp3|it was an obsession a torture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0234.mp3|he had lately failed to keep several of these appointments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0235.mp3|whose note used to be an unbounded trustfulness in the language of sentiment and manly tenderness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0236.mp3|the confiding disposition of various classes of women satisfied the needs of his self love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0237.mp3|and put some material means into his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0238.mp3|he needed it to live|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0240.mp3|but if he could no longer make use of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0241.mp3|he ran the risk of starving his ideals and his body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0242.mp3|this act of madness or despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0243.mp3|an impenetrable mystery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0245.mp3|to hang for ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0246.mp3|as far as all mankind was concerned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0247.mp3|but what of that if he alone of all men could never get rid of the cursed knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0250.mp3|he knew what the gangway man of the steamer had seen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0251.mp3|a lady in a black dress and a black veil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0252.mp3|wandering at midnight alongside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0257.mp3|he helped her on board|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0258.mp3|she seemed weak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0259.mp3|and he knew also what the stewardess had seen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0261.mp3|the stewardess induced her to lie down there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0262.mp3|the lady seemed quite unwilling to speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0263.mp3|and as if she were in some awful trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0265.mp3|the stewardess then went on deck to look for her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0267.mp3|her eyes were open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0268.mp3|but she would not answer anything that was said to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0269.mp3|she seemed very ill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0270.mp3|the stewardess fetched the chief steward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0271.mp3|and those two people stood by the side of the hooded seat consulting over their extraordinary and tragic passenger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0273.mp3|of communicating with her people in england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0274.mp3|then they went away to arrange for her removal down below|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0275.mp3|for indeed by what they could see of her face she seemed to them to be dying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0277.mp3|a love of life that could resist the furious anguish which drives to murder and the fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0278.mp3|the blind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0279.mp3|mad fear of the gallows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0281.mp3|but the stewardess and the chief steward knew nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0282.mp3|except that when they came back for her in less than five minutes the lady in black was no longer in the hooded seat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0283.mp3|she was nowhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0284.mp3|she was gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0285.mp3|it was then five o'clock in the morning and it was no accident either|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0287.mp3|it had stuck to the wood in a bit of wet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0288.mp3|and its glitter caught the man's eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0290.mp3|an impenetrable mystery is destined to hang for ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0292.mp3|beloved of various humble women of these isles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0293.mp3|apollo like in the sunniness of its bush of hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0294.mp3|the professor had grown restless meantime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0295.mp3|he rose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0296.mp3|stay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0298.mp3|here what do you know of madness and despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0299.mp3|the professor passed the tip of his tongue on his dry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0301.mp3|and said doctorally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0302.mp3|there are no such things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0303.mp3|all passion is lost now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0304.mp3|the world is mediocre limp without force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0306.mp3|and force is a crime in the eyes of the fools|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0307.mp3|the weak and the silly who rule the roost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0309.mp3|verloc|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0310.mp3|whose affair the police has managed to smother so nicely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0311.mp3|was mediocre|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0312.mp3|and the police murdered him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0313.mp3|he was mediocre|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0314.mp3|everybody is mediocre|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0315.mp3|madness and despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0316.mp3|give me that for a lever and i'll move the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0318.mp3|you are incapable of conceiving even what the fat fed citizen would call a crime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0319.mp3|you have no force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0321.mp3|smiling sardonically under the fierce glitter of his thick glasses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0322.mp3|and let me tell you that this little legacy they say you've come into has not improved your intelligence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0323.mp3|you sit at your beer like a dummy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0325.mp3|will you have it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0327.mp3|have what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0328.mp3|the legacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0329.mp3|all of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0330.mp3|the incorruptible professor only smiled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0331.mp3|his clothes were all but falling off him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0333.mp3|shapeless with repairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0334.mp3|heavy like lead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0336.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0338.mp3|i need them badly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0341.mp3|he was alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0342.mp3|an impenetrable mystery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0343.mp3|it seemed to him that suspended in the air before him he saw his own brain pulsating to the rhythm of an impenetrable mystery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0344.mp3|it was diseased clearly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0345.mp3|this act of madness or despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0347.mp3|then fell silent all at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0348.mp3|as if gone grumpy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0350.mp3|nicknamed the doctor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0352.mp3|at the door he hesitated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0353.mp3|blinking at a not too splendid sunlight and the paper with the report of the suicide of a lady was in his pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0354.mp3|his heart was beating against it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0355.mp3|the suicide of a lady this act of madness or despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0356.mp3|he walked along the street without looking where he put his feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0357.mp3|and he walked in a direction which would not bring him to the place of appointment with another lady an elderly nursery governess putting her trust in an apollo like ambrosial head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0358.mp3|he was walking away from it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0359.mp3|he could face no woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0360.mp3|it was ruin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0361.mp3|he could neither think work sleep nor eat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0362.mp3|but he was beginning to drink with pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0363.mp3|with anticipation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0364.mp3|with hope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0365.mp3|it was ruin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0366.mp3|his revolutionary career|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0367.mp3|sustained by the sentiment and trustfulness of many women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0368.mp3|was menaced by an impenetrable mystery the mystery of a human brain pulsating wrongfully to the rhythm of journalistic phrases|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0370.mp3|it was inclining towards the gutter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0371.mp3|of madness or despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0372.mp3|i am seriously ill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0373.mp3|he muttered to himself with scientific insight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0374.mp3|already his robust form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0375.mp3|with an embassy's secret service money inherited from mister verloc in his pockets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0376.mp3|was marching in the gutter as if in training for the task of an inevitable future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0377.mp3|already he bowed his broad shoulders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0378.mp3|his head of ambrosial locks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0379.mp3|as if ready to receive the leather yoke of the sandwich board|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0380.mp3|as on that night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0381.mp3|more than a week ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0383.mp3|feeling no fatigue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0384.mp3|feeling nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0385.mp3|seeing nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0386.mp3|hearing not a sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0387.mp3|an impenetrable mystery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0388.mp3|he walked disregarded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0389.mp3|this act of madness or despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0390.mp3|and the incorruptible professor walked too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0391.mp3|averting his eyes from the odious multitude of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0392.mp3|he had no future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0393.mp3|he disdained it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0394.mp3|he was a force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0395.mp3|his thoughts caressed the images of ruin and destruction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0396.mp3|he walked frail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0397.mp3|insignificant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0399.mp3|miserable and terrible in the simplicity of his idea calling madness and despair to the regeneration of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0400.mp3|nobody looked at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0401.mp3|he passed on unsuspected and deadly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_15_conrad_0402.mp3|like a pest in the street full of men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0002.mp3|and to my personal friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0003.mp3|an autobiographical impulse should twice in my life have taken possession of me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0004.mp3|in addressing the public|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0006.mp3|when i favoured the reader|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0008.mp3|and for no earthly reason that either the indulgent reader or the intrusive author could imagine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0010.mp3|and now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0011.mp3|because|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0013.mp3|i was happy enough to find a listener or two on the former occasion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0017.mp3|clerk of this parish was never more faithfully followed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0020.mp3|that when he casts his leaves forth upon the wind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0021.mp3|the author addresses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0022.mp3|not the many who will fling aside his volume|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0028.mp3|and indulge themselves in such confidential depths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed only and exclusively to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0029.mp3|as if the printed book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0032.mp3|and complete his circle of existence by bringing him into communion with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0036.mp3|even where we speak impersonally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0038.mp3|as thoughts are frozen and utterance benumbed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0039.mp3|unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his audience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0041.mp3|a kind and apprehensive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0042.mp3|though not the closest friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0043.mp3|is listening to our talk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0045.mp3|a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0046.mp3|we may prate of the circumstances that lie around us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0048.mp3|but still keep the inmost me behind its veil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0049.mp3|to this extent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0050.mp3|and within these limits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0053.mp3|may be autobiographical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0058.mp3|of a kind always recognised in literature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0059.mp3|as explaining how a large portion of the following pages came into my possession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0061.mp3|this in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0062.mp3|a desire to put myself in my true position as editor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0063.mp3|or very little more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0066.mp3|and no other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0067.mp3|is my true reason for assuming a personal relation with the public|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0068.mp3|in accomplishing the main purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0069.mp3|it has appeared allowable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0070.mp3|by a few extra touches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0072.mp3|together with some of the characters that move in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0073.mp3|among whom the author happened to make one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0074.mp3|in my native town of salem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0075.mp3|at the head of what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0076.mp3|half a century ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0077.mp3|in the days of old king derby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0078.mp3|was a bustling wharf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0079.mp3|but which is now burdened with decayed wooden warehouses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0080.mp3|and exhibits few or no symptoms of commercial life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0084.mp3|half way down its melancholy length|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0087.mp3|nearer at hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0088.mp3|a nova scotia schooner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0089.mp3|pitching out her cargo of firewood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0092.mp3|of this dilapidated wharf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0095.mp3|at the base and in the rear of the row of buildings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0096.mp3|the track of many languid years is seen in a border of unthrifty grass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0099.mp3|and thence across the harbour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0100.mp3|stands a spacious edifice of brick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0101.mp3|from the loftiest point of its roof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0102.mp3|during precisely three and a half hours of each forenoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0104.mp3|in breeze or calm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0105.mp3|the banner of the republic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0106.mp3|but with the thirteen stripes turned vertically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0107.mp3|instead of horizontally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0108.mp3|and thus indicating that a civil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0110.mp3|post of uncle sam's government is here established|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0111.mp3|its front is ornamented with a portico of half a dozen wooden pillars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0112.mp3|supporting a balcony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0113.mp3|beneath which a flight of wide granite steps descends towards the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0114.mp3|over the entrance hovers an enormous specimen of the american eagle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0116.mp3|a shield before her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0118.mp3|if i recollect aright|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0120.mp3|with the customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this unhappy fowl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0121.mp3|she appears by the fierceness of her beak and eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0122.mp3|and the general truculency of her attitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0124.mp3|and especially to warn all citizens careful of their safety against intruding on the premises which she overshadows with her wings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0125.mp3|nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0126.mp3|vixenly as she looks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0127.mp3|many people are seeking at this very moment to shelter themselves under the wing of the federal eagle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0131.mp3|but she has no great tenderness even in her best of moods|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0135.mp3|is apt to fling off her nestlings with a scratch of her claw|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0136.mp3|a dab of her beak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0138.mp3|the pavement round about the above described edifice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0139.mp3|which we may as well name at once as the custom house of the port|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0141.mp3|of late days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0142.mp3|been worn by any multitudinous resort of business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0145.mp3|there often chances a forenoon when affairs move onward with a livelier tread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0146.mp3|such occasions might remind the elderly citizen of that period|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0147.mp3|before the last war with england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0148.mp3|when salem was a port by itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0153.mp3|needlessly and imperceptibly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0154.mp3|the mighty flood of commerce at new york or boston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0155.mp3|on some such morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0158.mp3|there is a sound of frequent feet passing briskly up and down the granite steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0159.mp3|here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0160.mp3|before his own wife has greeted him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0162.mp3|just in port|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0163.mp3|with his vessel's papers under his arm in a tarnished tin box|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0166.mp3|comes his owner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0167.mp3|cheerful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0169.mp3|gracious or in the sulks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0170.mp3|accordingly as his scheme of the now accomplished voyage has been realized in merchandise that will readily be turned to gold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0171.mp3|or has buried him under a bulk of incommodities such as nobody will care to rid him of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0172.mp3|here likewise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0175.mp3|who gets the taste of traffic as a wolf cub does of blood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0176.mp3|and already sends adventures in his master's ships|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0178.mp3|another figure in the scene is the outward bound sailor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0179.mp3|in quest of a protection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0180.mp3|or the recently arrived one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0182.mp3|seeking a passport to the hospital|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0183.mp3|nor must we forget the captains of the rusty little schooners that bring firewood from the british provinces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0185.mp3|without the alertness of the yankee aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0187.mp3|cluster all these individuals together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0188.mp3|as they sometimes were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0189.mp3|with other miscellaneous ones to diversify the group|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0196.mp3|a row of venerable figures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0198.mp3|which were tipped on their hind legs back against the wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0199.mp3|oftentimes they were asleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0200.mp3|but occasionally might be heard talking together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0203.mp3|and all other human beings who depend for subsistence on charity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0206.mp3|these old gentlemen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0208.mp3|like matthew at the receipt of custom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0209.mp3|but not very liable to be summoned thence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0211.mp3|for apostolic errands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0213.mp3|furthermore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0214.mp3|on the left hand as you enter the front door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0215.mp3|is a certain room or office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0217.mp3|and of a lofty height|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0218.mp3|with two of its arched windows commanding a view of the aforesaid dilapidated wharf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0220.mp3|and along a portion of derby street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0221.mp3|all three give glimpses of the shops of grocers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0224.mp3|and ship chandlers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0226.mp3|laughing and gossiping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0231.mp3|in a fashion that has elsewhere fallen into long disuse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0232.mp3|and it is easy to conclude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0233.mp3|from the general slovenliness of the place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0235.mp3|with her tools of magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0236.mp3|the broom and mop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0237.mp3|has very infrequent access|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0238.mp3|in the way of furniture there is a stove with a voluminous funnel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0239.mp3|an old pine desk with a three legged stool beside it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0240.mp3|two or three wooden bottom chairs exceedingly decrepit and infirm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0242.mp3|not to forget the library|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0243.mp3|on some shelves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0244.mp3|a score or two of volumes of the acts of congress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0245.mp3|and a bulky digest of the revenue laws|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0246.mp3|a tin pipe ascends through the ceiling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0247.mp3|and forms a medium of vocal communication with other parts of the edifice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0249.mp3|pacing from corner to corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0250.mp3|or lounging on the long legged stool|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0251.mp3|with his elbow on the desk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0252.mp3|and his eyes wandering up and down the columns of the morning newspaper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0255.mp3|the same individual who welcomed you into his cheery little study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0258.mp3|should you go thither to seek him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0262.mp3|this old town of salem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0263.mp3|my native place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0266.mp3|or did possess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0267.mp3|a hold on my affection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0268.mp3|the force of which i have never realized during my seasons of actual residence here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0269.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0270.mp3|so far as its physical aspect is concerned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0271.mp3|with its flat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0272.mp3|unvaried surface|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0273.mp3|covered chiefly with wooden houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0274.mp3|few or none of which pretend to architectural beauty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0276.mp3|which is neither picturesque nor quaint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0278.mp3|its long and lazy street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0279.mp3|lounging wearisomely through the whole extent of the peninsula|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0280.mp3|with gallows hill and new guinea at one end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0284.mp3|and yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0285.mp3|though invariably happiest elsewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0286.mp3|there is within me a feeling for old salem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0287.mp3|which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0288.mp3|in lack of a better phrase|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0289.mp3|i must be content to call affection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0292.mp3|the earliest emigrant of my name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0294.mp3|and here his descendants have been born and died|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0296.mp3|until no small portion of it must necessarily be akin to the mortal frame wherewith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0297.mp3|for a little while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0298.mp3|i walk the streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0302.mp3|few of my countrymen can know what it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0304.mp3|as frequent transplantation is perhaps better for the stock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0305.mp3|need they consider it desirable to know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0306.mp3|but the sentiment has likewise its moral quality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0307.mp3|the figure of that first ancestor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0308.mp3|invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky grandeur|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0309.mp3|was present to my boyish imagination as far back as i can remember|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0310.mp3|it still haunts me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0311.mp3|and induces a sort of home feeling with the past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0316.mp3|and steeple crowned progenitor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0317.mp3|who came so early|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0318.mp3|with his bible and his sword|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0320.mp3|and made so large a figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0321.mp3|as a man of war and peace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0322.mp3|a stronger claim than for myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0324.mp3|he was a soldier legislator judge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0325.mp3|he was a ruler in the church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0326.mp3|he had all the puritanic traits both good and evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0327.mp3|he was likewise a bitter persecutor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0328.mp3|as witness the quakers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0329.mp3|who have remembered him in their histories|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0330.mp3|and relate an incident of his hard severity towards a woman of their sect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0332.mp3|it is to be feared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0333.mp3|than any record of his better deeds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0334.mp3|although these were many|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0338.mp3|and made himself so conspicuous in the martyrdom of the witches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0339.mp3|that their blood may fairly be said to have left a stain upon him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0343.mp3|in the charter street burial ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0344.mp3|must still retain it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0345.mp3|if they have not crumbled utterly to dust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0346.mp3|i know not whether these ancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0347.mp3|and ask pardon of heaven for their cruelties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0348.mp3|or whether they are now groaning under the heavy consequences of them in another state of being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0349.mp3|at all events|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0350.mp3|the present writer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0351.mp3|as their representative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0352.mp3|hereby take shame upon myself for their sakes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0353.mp3|and pray that any curse incurred by them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0354.mp3|as i have heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0357.mp3|would argue to exist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0358.mp3|may be now and henceforth removed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0361.mp3|either of these stern and black browed puritans would have thought it quite a sufficient retribution for his sins that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0362.mp3|after so long a lapse of years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0367.mp3|an idler like myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0368.mp3|no aim that i have ever cherished would they recognise as laudable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0369.mp3|no success of mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0371.mp3|beyond its domestic scope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0372.mp3|had ever been brightened by success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0373.mp3|would they deem otherwise than worthless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0374.mp3|if not positively disgraceful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0375.mp3|what is he murmurs one grey shadow of my forefathers to the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0376.mp3|a writer of story books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0379.mp3|or being serviceable to mankind in his day and generation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0380.mp3|may that be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0381.mp3|why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0384.mp3|and yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0385.mp3|let them scorn me as they will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0387.mp3|planted deep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0388.mp3|in the town's earliest infancy and childhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0390.mp3|the race has ever since subsisted here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0391.mp3|always too in respectability|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0392.mp3|never so far as i have known disgraced by a single unworthy member|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0393.mp3|but seldom or never|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0394.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0395.mp3|after the first two generations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0396.mp3|performing any memorable deed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0397.mp3|or so much as putting forward a claim to public notice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0398.mp3|gradually they have sunk almost out of sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0399.mp3|as old houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0400.mp3|here and there about the streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0404.mp3|in each generation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0405.mp3|retiring from the quarter deck to the homestead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0410.mp3|passed from the forecastle to the cabin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0411.mp3|spent a tempestuous manhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0415.mp3|and mingle his dust with the natal earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0417.mp3|as its place of birth and burial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0418.mp3|creates a kindred between the human being and the locality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0419.mp3|quite independent of any charm in the scenery or moral circumstances that surround him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0420.mp3|it is not love but instinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0421.mp3|the new inhabitant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0422.mp3|who came himself from a foreign land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0425.mp3|he has no conception of the oyster like tenacity with which an old settler|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0426.mp3|over whom his third century is creeping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0427.mp3|clings to the spot where his successive generations have been embedded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0428.mp3|it is no matter that the place is joyless for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0429.mp3|that he is weary of the old wooden houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0435.mp3|and whatever faults besides he may see or imagine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0438.mp3|and just as powerfully as if the natal spot were an earthly paradise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0439.mp3|so has it been in my case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0441.mp3|so that the mould of features and cast of character which had all along been familiar here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0443.mp3|as one representative of the race lay down in the grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0446.mp3|his sentry march along the main street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0448.mp3|nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0450.mp3|which has become an unhealthy one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0453.mp3|any more than a potato|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0460.mp3|shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0464.mp3|unjoyous attachment for my native town that brought me to fill a place in uncle sam's brick edifice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0467.mp3|have gone somewhere else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0468.mp3|my doom was on me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0470.mp3|as it seemed permanently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0473.mp3|or as if salem were for me the inevitable centre of the universe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0475.mp3|one fine morning i ascended the flight of granite steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0476.mp3|with the president's commission in my pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00a_hawthorne_0477.mp3|and was introduced to the corps of gentlemen who were to aid me in my weighty responsibility as chief executive officer of the custom house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0001.mp3|or rather i do not doubt at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0002.mp3|whether any public functionary of the united states|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0003.mp3|either in the civil or military line|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0004.mp3|has ever had such a patriarchal body of veterans under his orders as myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0005.mp3|the whereabouts of the oldest inhabitant was at once settled when i looked at them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0006.mp3|for upwards of twenty years before this epoch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0007.mp3|the independent position of the collector had kept the salem custom house out of the whirlpool of political vicissitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0008.mp3|which makes the tenure of office generally so fragile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0009.mp3|a soldier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0010.mp3|new england's most distinguished soldier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0011.mp3|he stood firmly on the pedestal of his gallant services|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0012.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0013.mp3|himself secure in the wise liberality of the successive administrations through which he had held office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0015.mp3|general miller was radically conservative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0016.mp3|a man over whose kindly nature habit had no slight influence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0017.mp3|attaching himself strongly to familiar faces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0018.mp3|and with difficulty moved to change|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0019.mp3|even when change might have brought unquestionable improvement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0020.mp3|thus on taking charge of my department i found few but aged men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0024.mp3|after being tossed on every sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0025.mp3|and standing up sturdily against life's tempestuous blast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0026.mp3|had finally drifted into this quiet nook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0028.mp3|with little to disturb them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0029.mp3|except the periodical terrors of a presidential election|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0030.mp3|they one and all acquired a new lease of existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0031.mp3|though by no means less liable than their fellow men to age and infirmity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0032.mp3|they had evidently some talisman or other that kept death at bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0033.mp3|two or three of their number|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0034.mp3|as i was assured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0037.mp3|never dreamed of making their appearance at the custom house during a large part of the year|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0038.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0039.mp3|after a torpid winter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0040.mp3|would creep out into the warm sunshine of may or june|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0041.mp3|go lazily about what they termed duty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0043.mp3|at their own leisure and convenience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0045.mp3|i must plead guilty to the charge of abbreviating the official breath of more than one of these venerable servants of the republic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0046.mp3|they were allowed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0047.mp3|on my representation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0048.mp3|to rest from their arduous labours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0049.mp3|and soon afterwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0050.mp3|as if their sole principle of life had been zeal for their country's service|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0051.mp3|as i verily believe it was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0052.mp3|withdrew to a better world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0053.mp3|it is a pious consolation to me that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0054.mp3|through my interference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0055.mp3|a sufficient space was allowed them for repentance of the evil and corrupt practices into which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0056.mp3|as a matter of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0057.mp3|every custom house officer must be supposed to fall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0058.mp3|neither the front nor the back entrance of the custom house opens on the road to paradise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0061.mp3|and though a faithful democrat in principle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0062.mp3|neither received nor held his office with any reference to political services|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0063.mp3|had it been otherwise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0064.mp3|had an active politician been put into this influential post|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0066.mp3|whose infirmities withheld him from the personal administration of his office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0067.mp3|hardly a man of the old corps would have drawn the breath of official life within a month after the exterminating angel had come up the custom house steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0068.mp3|according to the received code in such matters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0069.mp3|it would have been nothing short of duty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0070.mp3|in a politician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0071.mp3|to bring every one of those white heads under the axe of the guillotine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0072.mp3|it was plain enough to discern that the old fellows dreaded some such discourtesy at my hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0073.mp3|it pained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0074.mp3|and at the same time amused me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0075.mp3|to behold the terrors that attended my advent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0076.mp3|to see a furrowed cheek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0077.mp3|weather beaten by half a century of storm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0078.mp3|turn ashy pale at the glance of so harmless an individual as myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0079.mp3|to detect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0080.mp3|as one or another addressed me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0081.mp3|the tremor of a voice which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0082.mp3|in long past days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0083.mp3|had been wont to bellow through a speaking trumpet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0086.mp3|these excellent old persons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0088.mp3|by all established rule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0090.mp3|as regarded some of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0091.mp3|weighed by their own lack of efficiency for business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0092.mp3|they ought to have given place to younger men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0093.mp3|more orthodox in politics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0094.mp3|and altogether fitter than themselves to serve our common uncle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0097.mp3|but could never quite find in my heart to act upon the knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0100.mp3|and considerably to the detriment of my official conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0101.mp3|they continued|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0102.mp3|during my incumbency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0104.mp3|and loiter up and down the custom house steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0105.mp3|they spent a good deal of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0107.mp3|asleep in their accustomed corners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0108.mp3|with their chairs tilted back against the walls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0111.mp3|once or twice in the forenoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0112.mp3|to bore one another with the several thousandth repetition of old sea stories and mouldy jokes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0113.mp3|that had grown to be passwords and countersigns among them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0114.mp3|the discovery was soon made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0116.mp3|that the new surveyor had no great harm in him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0119.mp3|in their own behalf at least if not for our beloved country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0120.mp3|these good old gentlemen went through the various formalities of office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0122.mp3|did they peep into the holds of vessels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0123.mp3|mighty was their fuss about little matters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0125.mp3|sometimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0126.mp3|the obtuseness that allowed greater ones to slip between their fingers whenever such a mischance occurred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0130.mp3|and directly beneath their unsuspicious noses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0131.mp3|nothing could exceed the vigilance and alacrity with which they proceeded to lock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0132.mp3|and double lock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0133.mp3|and secure with tape and sealing wax|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0134.mp3|all the avenues of the delinquent vessel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0135.mp3|instead of a reprimand for their previous negligence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0137.mp3|a grateful recognition of the promptitude of their zeal the moment that there was no longer any remedy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0138.mp3|unless people are more than commonly disagreeable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0139.mp3|it is my foolish habit to contract a kindness for them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0140.mp3|the better part of my companion's character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0141.mp3|if it have a better part|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0144.mp3|as most of these old custom house officers had good traits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0145.mp3|and as my position in reference to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0146.mp3|being paternal and protective|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0147.mp3|was favourable to the growth of friendly sentiments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0148.mp3|i soon grew to like them all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0149.mp3|it was pleasant in the summer forenoons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0150.mp3|when the fervent heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0152.mp3|merely communicated a genial warmth to their half torpid systems|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0153.mp3|it was pleasant to hear them chatting in the back entry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0156.mp3|while the frozen witticisms of past generations were thawed out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0157.mp3|and came bubbling with laughter from their lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0159.mp3|the jollity of aged men has much in common with the mirth of children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0161.mp3|any more than a deep sense of humour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0162.mp3|has little to do with the matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0165.mp3|a gleam that plays upon the surface|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0166.mp3|and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to the green branch and grey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0167.mp3|mouldering trunk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0168.mp3|in one case however it is real sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0172.mp3|the reader must understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0173.mp3|to represent all my excellent old friends as in their dotage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0174.mp3|in the first place my coadjutors were not invariably old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0175.mp3|there were men among them in their strength and prime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0176.mp3|of marked ability and energy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0177.mp3|and altogether superior to the sluggish and dependent mode of life on which their evil stars had cast them|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0180.mp3|the white locks of age were sometimes found to be the thatch of an intellectual tenement in good repair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0182.mp3|as respects the majority of my corps of veterans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0183.mp3|there will be no wrong done if i characterize them generally as a set of wearisome old souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0184.mp3|who had gathered nothing worth preservation from their varied experience of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0186.mp3|which they had enjoyed so many opportunities of harvesting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0187.mp3|and most carefully to have stored their memory with the husks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0188.mp3|they spoke with far more interest and unction of their morning's breakfast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0189.mp3|or yesterday's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0192.mp3|than of the shipwreck of forty or fifty years ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0193.mp3|and all the world's wonders which they had witnessed with their youthful eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0194.mp3|the father of the custom house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0195.mp3|the patriarch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0196.mp3|not only of this little squad of officials|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0197.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0198.mp3|i am bold to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0199.mp3|of the respectable body of tide waiters all over the united states|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0200.mp3|was a certain permanent inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0201.mp3|he might truly be termed a legitimate son of the revenue system|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0204.mp3|since his sire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0205.mp3|a revolutionary colonel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0206.mp3|and formerly collector of the port|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0207.mp3|had created an office for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0209.mp3|at a period of the early ages which few living men can now remember|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0210.mp3|this inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0211.mp3|when i first knew him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0212.mp3|was a man of fourscore years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0215.mp3|with his florid cheek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0216.mp3|his compact figure smartly arrayed in a bright buttoned blue coat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0217.mp3|his brisk and vigorous step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0218.mp3|and his hale and hearty aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0219.mp3|altogether he seemed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0220.mp3|not young indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0221.mp3|but a kind of new contrivance of mother nature in the shape of man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0222.mp3|whom age and infirmity had no business to touch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0223.mp3|his voice and laugh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0224.mp3|which perpetually re echoed through the custom house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0225.mp3|had nothing of the tremulous quaver and cackle of an old man's utterance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0226.mp3|they came strutting out of his lungs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0227.mp3|like the crow of a cock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0228.mp3|or the blast of a clarion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0229.mp3|looking at him merely as an animal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0230.mp3|and there was very little else to look at|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0231.mp3|he was a most satisfactory object|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0232.mp3|from the thorough healthfulness and wholesomeness of his system|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0233.mp3|and his capacity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0234.mp3|at that extreme age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0235.mp3|to enjoy all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0236.mp3|or nearly all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0237.mp3|the delights which he had ever aimed at or conceived of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0238.mp3|the careless security of his life in the custom house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0239.mp3|on a regular income|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0240.mp3|and with but slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0241.mp3|had no doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0242.mp3|the original and more potent causes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0245.mp3|the moderate proportion of intellect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0246.mp3|and the very trifling admixture of moral and spiritual ingredients|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0249.mp3|being in barely enough measure to keep the old gentleman from walking on all fours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0250.mp3|he possessed no power of thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0252.mp3|no troublesome sensibilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0255.mp3|but a few commonplace instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0257.mp3|aided by the cheerful temper which grew inevitably out of his physical well being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0258.mp3|did duty very respectably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0260.mp3|in lieu of a heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0261.mp3|he had been the husband of three wives all long since dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0262.mp3|the father of twenty children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0263.mp3|most of whom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0264.mp3|at every age of childhood or maturity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0265.mp3|had likewise returned to dust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0267.mp3|one would suppose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0269.mp3|not so with our old inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0270.mp3|one brief sigh sufficed to carry off the entire burden of these dismal reminiscences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0272.mp3|far readier than the collector's junior clerk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0273.mp3|who at nineteen years was much the elder and graver man of the two|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0274.mp3|i used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0276.mp3|livelier curiosity than any other form of humanity there presented to my notice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0277.mp3|he was in truth a rare phenomenon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0278.mp3|so perfect in one point of view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0279.mp3|so shallow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0280.mp3|so delusive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0281.mp3|so impalpable such an absolute nonentity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0282.mp3|in every other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0283.mp3|my conclusion was that he had no soul no heart no mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0284.mp3|nothing as i have already said but instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0287.mp3|so cunningly had the few materials of his character been put together that there was no painful perception of deficiency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0289.mp3|on my part|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0290.mp3|an entire contentment with what i found in him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0291.mp3|it might be difficult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0292.mp3|and it was so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0293.mp3|to conceive how he should exist hereafter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0294.mp3|so earthly and sensuous did he seem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0295.mp3|but surely his existence here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0296.mp3|admitting that it was to terminate with his last breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0297.mp3|had been not unkindly given|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0298.mp3|with no higher moral responsibilities than the beasts of the field|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0299.mp3|but with a larger scope of enjoyment than theirs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0300.mp3|and with all their blessed immunity from the dreariness and duskiness of age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0303.mp3|and to hear him talk of roast meat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0304.mp3|as he possessed no higher attribute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0306.mp3|it always pleased and satisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0309.mp3|and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0310.mp3|his reminiscences of good cheer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0311.mp3|however ancient the date of the actual banquet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0312.mp3|seemed to bring the savour of pig or turkey under one's very nostrils|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0315.mp3|i have heard him smack his lips over dinners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0316.mp3|every guest at which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0317.mp3|except himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0318.mp3|had long been food for worms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0319.mp3|it was marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals were continually rising up before him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0321.mp3|but as if grateful for his former appreciation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0323.mp3|at once shadowy and sensual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0326.mp3|a spare rib of pork|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0327.mp3|a particular chicken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0329.mp3|which had perhaps adorned his board in the days of the elder adams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0330.mp3|would be remembered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0331.mp3|while all the subsequent experience of our race|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0332.mp3|and all the events that brightened or darkened his individual career|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0333.mp3|had gone over him with as little permanent effect as the passing breeze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0334.mp3|the chief tragic event of the old man's life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0335.mp3|so far as i could judge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0337.mp3|which lived and died some twenty or forty years ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0338.mp3|a goose of most promising figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0339.mp3|but which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0340.mp3|at table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0341.mp3|proved so inveterately tough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0343.mp3|and it could only be divided with an axe and handsaw|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0344.mp3|but it is time to quit this sketch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0345.mp3|on which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0347.mp3|i should be glad to dwell at considerably more length|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0348.mp3|because of all men whom i have ever known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0349.mp3|this individual was fittest to be a custom house officer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0350.mp3|most persons|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0353.mp3|the old inspector was incapable of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0354.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0355.mp3|were he to continue in office to the end of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0356.mp3|would be just as good as he was then|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0358.mp3|there is one likeness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0359.mp3|without which my gallery of custom house portraits would be strangely incomplete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0361.mp3|it is that of the collector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0362.mp3|our gallant old general|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0364.mp3|after his brilliant military service|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0365.mp3|subsequently to which he had ruled over a wild western territory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0366.mp3|had come hither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0367.mp3|twenty years before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0368.mp3|to spend the decline of his varied and honourable life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0369.mp3|the brave soldier had already numbered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0370.mp3|nearly or quite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0372.mp3|and was pursuing the remainder of his earthly march|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0373.mp3|burdened with infirmities which even the martial music of his own spirit stirring recollections could do little towards lightening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0375.mp3|it was only with the assistance of a servant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0376.mp3|and by leaning his hand heavily on the iron balustrade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0377.mp3|that he could slowly and painfully ascend the custom house steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0379.mp3|with a toilsome progress across the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0381.mp3|there he used to sit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0382.mp3|gazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at the figures that came and went|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0383.mp3|amid the rustle of papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0384.mp3|the administering of oaths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0385.mp3|the discussion of business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0386.mp3|and the casual talk of the office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0387.mp3|all which sounds and circumstances seemed but indistinctly to impress his senses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0388.mp3|and hardly to make their way into his inner sphere of contemplation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0390.mp3|if his notice was sought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0391.mp3|an expression of courtesy and interest gleamed out upon his features|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0392.mp3|proving that there was light within him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0393.mp3|and that it was only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp that obstructed the rays in their passage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0394.mp3|the closer you penetrated to the substance of his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0395.mp3|the sounder it appeared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0396.mp3|when no longer called upon to speak or listen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0397.mp3|either of which operations cost him an evident effort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0398.mp3|his face would briefly subside into its former not uncheerful quietude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0399.mp3|it was not painful to behold this look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0400.mp3|for though dim it had not the imbecility of decaying age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0401.mp3|the framework of his nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0402.mp3|originally strong and massive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0403.mp3|was not yet crumpled into ruin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0406.mp3|under such disadvantages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0407.mp3|was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up anew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0408.mp3|in imagination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0409.mp3|an old fortress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0411.mp3|from a view of its grey and broken ruins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0412.mp3|here and there perchance the walls may remain almost complete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0413.mp3|but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0414.mp3|cumbrous with its very strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0415.mp3|and overgrown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0416.mp3|through long years of peace and neglect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0417.mp3|with grass and alien weeds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0418.mp3|nevertheless looking at the old warrior with affection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0420.mp3|slight as was the communication between us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0421.mp3|my feeling towards him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0422.mp3|like that of all bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0423.mp3|might not improperly be termed so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0424.mp3|i could discern the main points of his portrait|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0425.mp3|it was marked with the noble and heroic qualities which showed it to be not a mere accident|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0426.mp3|but of good right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0427.mp3|that he had won a distinguished name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0428.mp3|his spirit could never|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0429.mp3|i conceive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0430.mp3|have been characterized by an uneasy activity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0432.mp3|at any period of his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0433.mp3|have required an impulse to set him in motion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0437.mp3|it was not in the man to give out or fail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0438.mp3|the heat that had formerly pervaded his nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0439.mp3|and which was not yet extinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0440.mp3|was never of the kind that flashes and flickers in a blaze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0441.mp3|but rather a deep red glow as of iron in a furnace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0442.mp3|weight solidity firmness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0443.mp3|this was the expression of his repose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0444.mp3|even in such decay as had crept untimely over him at the period of which i speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0445.mp3|but i could imagine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0446.mp3|even then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0448.mp3|under some excitement which should go deeply into his consciousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0449.mp3|roused by a trumpet's peal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0450.mp3|loud enough to awaken all of his energies that were not dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0451.mp3|but only slumbering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0452.mp3|he was yet capable of flinging off his infirmities like a sick man's gown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0453.mp3|dropping the staff of age to seize a battle sword|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0454.mp3|and starting up once more a warrior|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0455.mp3|and in so intense a moment his demeanour would have still been calm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0456.mp3|such an exhibition however was but to be pictured in fancy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0457.mp3|not to be anticipated nor desired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0458.mp3|what i saw in him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0460.mp3|already cited as the most appropriate simile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0461.mp3|was the features of stubborn and ponderous endurance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0462.mp3|which might well have amounted to obstinacy in his earlier days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0463.mp3|of integrity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0465.mp3|like most of his other endowments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0466.mp3|lay in a somewhat heavy mass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0467.mp3|and was just as unmalleable or unmanageable as a ton of iron ore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0468.mp3|and of benevolence which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0471.mp3|he had slain men with his own hand for aught i know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0474.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0475.mp3|be that as it might|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0477.mp3|i have not known the man to whose innate kindliness i would more confidently make an appeal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0478.mp3|many characteristics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0482.mp3|must have vanished or been obscured before i met the general|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0483.mp3|all merely graceful attributes are usually the most evanescent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0484.mp3|nor does nature adorn the human ruin with blossoms of new beauty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0485.mp3|that have their roots and proper nutriment only in the chinks and crevices of decay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0488.mp3|even in respect of grace and beauty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0489.mp3|there were points well worth noting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0490.mp3|a ray of humour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0491.mp3|now and then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0493.mp3|and glimmer pleasantly upon our faces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0494.mp3|a trait of native elegance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0495.mp3|seldom seen in the masculine character after childhood or early youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0496.mp3|was shown in the general's fondness for the sight and fragrance of flowers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0497.mp3|an old soldier might be supposed to prize only the bloody laurel on his brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0498.mp3|but here was one who seemed to have a young girl's appreciation of the floral tribe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0499.mp3|there beside the fireplace the brave old general used to sit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0502.mp3|when it could be avoided|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0503.mp3|taking upon himself the difficult task of engaging him in conversation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0504.mp3|was fond of standing at a distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0508.mp3|unattainable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0509.mp3|though we might have stretched forth our hands and touched his own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0510.mp3|it might be that he lived a more real life within his thoughts than amid the unappropriate environment of the collector's office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0511.mp3|the evolutions of the parade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0512.mp3|the tumult of the battle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0513.mp3|the flourish of old heroic music heard thirty years before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0514.mp3|such scenes and sounds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0515.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0516.mp3|were all alive before his intellectual sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0519.mp3|the spruce clerks and uncouth sailors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0520.mp3|entered and departed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0522.mp3|and neither with the men nor their affairs did the general appear to sustain the most distant relation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0523.mp3|he was as much out of place as an old sword|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0524.mp3|now rusty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0525.mp3|but which had flashed once in the battle's front|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0526.mp3|and showed still a bright gleam along its blade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0527.mp3|would have been among the inkstands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0531.mp3|the man of true and simple energy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0532.mp3|it was the recollection of those memorable words of his|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0533.mp3|i'll try sir|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0534.mp3|spoken on the very verge of a desperate and heroic enterprise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0535.mp3|and breathing the soul and spirit of new england hardihood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0536.mp3|comprehending all perils|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0537.mp3|and encountering all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0539.mp3|in our country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0540.mp3|valour were rewarded by heraldic honour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0543.mp3|but which only he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0544.mp3|with such a task of danger and glory before him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0545.mp3|has ever spoken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0546.mp3|would be the best and fittest of all mottoes for the general's shield of arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0547.mp3|it contributes greatly towards a man's moral and intellectual health to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0548.mp3|who care little for his pursuits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0550.mp3|the accidents of my life have often afforded me this advantage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0551.mp3|but never with more fulness and variety than during my continuance in office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0554.mp3|the observation of whose character gave me a new idea of talent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0555.mp3|his gifts were emphatically those of a man of business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0556.mp3|prompt acute clear minded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0560.mp3|it was his proper field of activity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0561.mp3|and the many intricacies of business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0562.mp3|so harassing to the interloper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0563.mp3|presented themselves before him with the regularity of a perfectly comprehended system|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0564.mp3|in my contemplation he stood as the ideal of his class|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0565.mp3|he was indeed the custom house in himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0567.mp3|at all events|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0570.mp3|in an institution like this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0571.mp3|where its officers are appointed to subserve their own profit and convenience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0572.mp3|and seldom with a leading reference to their fitness for the duty to be performed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0575.mp3|by an inevitable necessity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0576.mp3|as a magnet attracts steel filings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0577.mp3|so did our man of business draw to himself the difficulties which everybody met with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0578.mp3|with an easy condescension|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0579.mp3|and kind forbearance towards our stupidity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0580.mp3|which to his order of mind must have seemed little short of crime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0582.mp3|by the merest touch of his finger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0583.mp3|make the incomprehensible as clear as daylight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0584.mp3|the merchants valued him not less than we his esoteric friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0585.mp3|his integrity was perfect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0586.mp3|it was a law of nature with him rather than a choice or a principle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0587.mp3|nor can it be otherwise than the main condition of an intellect so remarkably clear and accurate as his to be honest and regular in the administration of affairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0588.mp3|a stain on his conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0590.mp3|would trouble such a man very much in the same way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0591.mp3|though to a far greater degree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0592.mp3|than an error in the balance of an account|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0593.mp3|or an ink blot on the fair page of a book of record|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0594.mp3|here in a word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0595.mp3|and it is a rare instance in my life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00b_hawthorne_0596.mp3|i had met with a person thoroughly adapted to the situation which he held|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0001.mp3|i took it in good part|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0002.mp3|at the hands of providence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0003.mp3|that i was thrown into a position so little akin to my past habits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0004.mp3|and set myself seriously to gather from it whatever profit was to be had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0005.mp3|after my fellowship of toil and impracticable schemes with the dreamy brethren of brook farm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0006.mp3|after living for three years within the subtle influence of an intellect like emerson's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0007.mp3|after those wild|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0009.mp3|indulging fantastic speculations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0010.mp3|beside our fire of fallen boughs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0013.mp3|after growing fastidious by sympathy with the classic refinement of hillard's culture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0014.mp3|after becoming imbued with poetic sentiment at longfellow's hearthstone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0015.mp3|it was time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0016.mp3|at length|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0017.mp3|that i should exercise other faculties of my nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0018.mp3|and nourish myself with food for which i had hitherto had little appetite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0019.mp3|even the old inspector was desirable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0020.mp3|as a change of diet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0022.mp3|i looked upon it as an evidence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0023.mp3|in some measure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0024.mp3|of a system naturally well balanced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0025.mp3|and lacking no essential part of a thorough organization|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0027.mp3|with such associates to remember|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0028.mp3|i could mingle at once with men of altogether different qualities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0029.mp3|and never murmur at the change|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0031.mp3|its exertions and objects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0032.mp3|were now of little moment in my regard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0033.mp3|i cared not at this period for books they were apart from me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0035.mp3|except it were human nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0036.mp3|the nature that is developed in earth and sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0039.mp3|hidden from me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0040.mp3|and all the imaginative delight wherewith it had been spiritualized passed away out of my mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0042.mp3|a faculty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0043.mp3|if it had not been departed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0044.mp3|was suspended and inanimate within me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0045.mp3|there would have been something sad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0048.mp3|had i not been conscious that it lay at my own option to recall whatever was valuable in the past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0051.mp3|that this was a life which could not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0052.mp3|with impunity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0056.mp3|without transforming me into any shape which it would be worth my while to take|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0057.mp3|but i never considered it as other than a transitory life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0058.mp3|there was always a prophetic instinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0059.mp3|a low whisper in my ear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0060.mp3|that within no long period|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0061.mp3|and whenever a new change of custom should be essential to my good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0062.mp3|change would come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0063.mp3|meanwhile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0065.mp3|a surveyor of the revenue and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0066.mp3|so far as i have been able to understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0068.mp3|a man of thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0070.mp3|and sensibility had he ten times the surveyor's proportion of those qualities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0072.mp3|at any time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0073.mp3|be a man of affairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0074.mp3|if he will only choose to give himself the trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0075.mp3|my fellow officers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0076.mp3|and the merchants and sea captains with whom my official duties brought me into any manner of connection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0077.mp3|viewed me in no other light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0078.mp3|and probably knew me in no other character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0086.mp3|each of whom was a custom house officer in his day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0087.mp3|as well as i it is a good lesson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0088.mp3|though it may often be a hard one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0089.mp3|for a man who has dreamed of literary fame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0090.mp3|and of making for himself a rank among the world's dignitaries by such means|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0091.mp3|to step aside out of the narrow circle in which his claims are recognized and to find how utterly devoid of significance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0092.mp3|beyond that circle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0093.mp3|is all that he achieves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0094.mp3|and all he aims at|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0095.mp3|i know not that i especially needed the lesson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0096.mp3|either in the way of warning or rebuke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0097.mp3|but at any rate i learned it thoroughly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0099.mp3|it gives me pleasure to reflect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0100.mp3|did the truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0101.mp3|as it came home to my perception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0102.mp3|ever cost me a pang|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0104.mp3|in the way of literary talk it is true the naval officer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0105.mp3|an excellent fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0107.mp3|and went out only a little later|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0109.mp3|napoleon or shakespeare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0110.mp3|the collector's junior clerk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0111.mp3|too a young gentleman who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0112.mp3|it was whispered occasionally covered a sheet of uncle sam's letter paper with what at the distance of a few yards looked very much like poetry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0113.mp3|used now and then to speak to me of books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0114.mp3|as matters with which i might possibly be conversant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0115.mp3|this was my all of lettered intercourse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0116.mp3|and it was quite sufficient for my necessities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0118.mp3|i smiled to think that it had now another kind of vogue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0120.mp3|with a stencil and black paint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0121.mp3|on pepper bags|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0123.mp3|and cigar boxes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0124.mp3|and bales of all kinds of dutiable merchandise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0126.mp3|and gone regularly through the office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0128.mp3|a knowledge of my existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0129.mp3|so far as a name conveys it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0130.mp3|was carried where it had never been before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0133.mp3|will never go again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0134.mp3|but the past was not dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0135.mp3|once in a great while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0136.mp3|the thoughts that had seemed so vital and so active|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0137.mp3|yet had been put to rest so quietly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0138.mp3|revived again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0139.mp3|one of the most remarkable occasions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0140.mp3|when the habit of bygone days awoke in me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0141.mp3|was that which brings it within the law of literary propriety to offer the public the sketch which i am now writing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0144.mp3|the edifice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0145.mp3|originally projected on a scale adapted to the old commercial enterprise of the port|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0146.mp3|and with an idea of subsequent prosperity destined never to be realized|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0147.mp3|contains far more space than its occupants know what to do with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0148.mp3|this airy hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0149.mp3|therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0150.mp3|over the collector's apartments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0151.mp3|remains unfinished to this day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0153.mp3|in spite of the aged cobwebs that festoon its dusky beams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0154.mp3|appears still to await the labour of the carpenter and mason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0155.mp3|at one end of the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0156.mp3|in a recess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0157.mp3|were a number of barrels piled one upon another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0158.mp3|containing bundles of official documents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0159.mp3|large quantities of similar rubbish lay lumbering the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0160.mp3|it was sorrowful to think how many days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0162.mp3|and months|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0163.mp3|and years of toil had been wasted on these musty papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0164.mp3|which were now only an encumbrance on earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0165.mp3|and were hidden away in this forgotten corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0166.mp3|never more to be glanced at by human eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0167.mp3|but then what reams of other manuscripts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0168.mp3|filled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0169.mp3|not with the dulness of official formalities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0170.mp3|but with the thought of inventive brains and the rich effusion of deep hearts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0171.mp3|had gone equally to oblivion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0174.mp3|without serving a purpose in their day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0175.mp3|as these heaped up papers had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0176.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0177.mp3|saddest of all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0178.mp3|without purchasing for their writers the comfortable livelihood which the clerks of the custom house had gained by these worthless scratchings of the pen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0179.mp3|yet not altogether worthless perhaps as materials of local history|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0182.mp3|statistics of the former commerce of salem might be discovered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0183.mp3|and memorials of her princely merchants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0184.mp3|old king derby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0186.mp3|old simon forrester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0188.mp3|whose powdered head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0190.mp3|was scarcely in the tomb before his mountain pile of wealth began to dwindle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0191.mp3|the founders of the greater part of the families which now compose the aristocracy of salem might here be traced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0192.mp3|from the petty and obscure beginnings of their traffic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0193.mp3|at periods generally much posterior to the revolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0194.mp3|upward to what their children look upon as long established rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0195.mp3|prior to the revolution there is a dearth of records|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0196.mp3|the earlier documents and archives of the custom house having|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0197.mp3|probably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0198.mp3|been carried off to halifax|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0199.mp3|when all the king's officials accompanied the british army in its flight from boston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0200.mp3|it has often been a matter of regret with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0204.mp3|to the days of the protectorate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0205.mp3|those papers must have contained many references to forgotten or remembered men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0206.mp3|and to antique customs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0208.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0209.mp3|one idle and rainy day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0210.mp3|it was my fortune to make a discovery of some little interest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0211.mp3|poking and burrowing into the heaped up rubbish in the corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0212.mp3|unfolding one and another document|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0215.mp3|nor very readily decipherable on their mossy tombstones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0216.mp3|glancing at such matters with the saddened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0218.mp3|half reluctant interest which we bestow on the corpse of dead activity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0219.mp3|and exerting my fancy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0220.mp3|sluggish with little use|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0221.mp3|to raise up from these dry bones an image of the old town's brighter aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0222.mp3|when india was a new region|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0223.mp3|and only salem knew the way thither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0224.mp3|i chanced to lay my hand on a small package|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0225.mp3|carefully done up in a piece of ancient yellow parchment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0226.mp3|this envelope had the air of an official record of some period long past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0228.mp3|there was something about it that quickened an instinctive curiosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0229.mp3|and made me undo the faded red tape that tied up the package|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0231.mp3|unbending the rigid folds of the parchment cover|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0232.mp3|i found it to be a commission|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0233.mp3|under the hand and seal of governor shirley|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0236.mp3|in the province of massachusetts bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0239.mp3|and likewise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0240.mp3|in a newspaper of recent times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0242.mp3|during the renewal of that edifice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0244.mp3|if i rightly call to mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0245.mp3|was left of my respected predecessor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0246.mp3|save an imperfect skeleton|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0247.mp3|and some fragments of apparel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0248.mp3|and a wig of majestic frizzle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0250.mp3|unlike the head that it once adorned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0251.mp3|was in very satisfactory preservation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0252.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0253.mp3|on examining the papers which the parchment commission served to envelop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0255.mp3|and the internal operations of his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0256.mp3|than the frizzled wig had contained of the venerable skull itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0259.mp3|not official|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0260.mp3|but of a private nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0263.mp3|written in his private capacity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0264.mp3|and apparently with his own hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0266.mp3|and that these papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0267.mp3|which he probably kept in his official desk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0268.mp3|had never come to the knowledge of his heirs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0270.mp3|on the transfer of the archives to halifax|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0271.mp3|this package|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0272.mp3|proving to be of no public concern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0273.mp3|was left behind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0274.mp3|and had remained ever since unopened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0275.mp3|the ancient surveyor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0276.mp3|being little molested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0279.mp3|seems to have devoted some of his many leisure hours to researches as a local antiquarian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0280.mp3|and other inquisitions of a similar nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0281.mp3|these supplied material for petty activity to a mind that would otherwise have been eaten up with rust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0282.mp3|a portion of his facts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0284.mp3|did me good service in the preparation of the article entitled main street included in the present volume|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0285.mp3|the remainder may perhaps be applied to purposes equally valuable hereafter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0286.mp3|or not impossibly may be worked up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0287.mp3|so far as they go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0288.mp3|into a regular history of salem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0289.mp3|should my veneration for the natal soil ever impel me to so pious a task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0291.mp3|they shall be at the command of any gentleman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0292.mp3|inclined and competent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0294.mp3|as a final disposition i contemplate depositing them with the essex historical society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0295.mp3|but the object that most drew my attention to the mysterious package was a certain affair of fine red cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0296.mp3|much worn and faded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0297.mp3|there were traces about it of gold embroidery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0301.mp3|so that none|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0304.mp3|it had been wrought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0305.mp3|as was easy to perceive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0306.mp3|with wonderful skill of needlework|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0307.mp3|and the stitch as i am assured by ladies conversant with such mysteries gives evidence of a now forgotten art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0308.mp3|not to be discovered even by the process of picking out the threads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0309.mp3|this rag of scarlet cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0310.mp3|for time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0313.mp3|on careful examination assumed the shape of a letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0314.mp3|it was the capital letter a by an accurate measurement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0315.mp3|each limb proved to be precisely three inches and a quarter in length|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0316.mp3|it had been intended|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0317.mp3|there could be no doubt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0318.mp3|as an ornamental article of dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0319.mp3|but how it was to be worn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0320.mp3|or what rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0324.mp3|were signified by it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0326.mp3|and yet it strangely interested me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0327.mp3|my eyes fastened themselves upon the old scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0328.mp3|and would not be turned aside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0329.mp3|certainly there was some deep meaning in it most worthy of interpretation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0330.mp3|and which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0332.mp3|streamed forth from the mystic symbol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0333.mp3|subtly communicating itself to my sensibilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0334.mp3|but evading the analysis of my mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0335.mp3|when thus perplexed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0337.mp3|among other hypotheses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0338.mp3|whether the letter might not have been one of those decorations which the white men used to contrive in order to take the eyes of indians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0339.mp3|i happened to place it on my breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0340.mp3|it seemed to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0341.mp3|the reader may smile but must not doubt my word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0344.mp3|that i experienced a sensation not altogether physical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0345.mp3|yet almost so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0346.mp3|as of burning heat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0347.mp3|and as if the letter were not of red cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0348.mp3|but red hot iron|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0349.mp3|i shuddered and involuntarily let it fall upon the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0350.mp3|in the absorbing contemplation of the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0351.mp3|i had hitherto neglected to examine a small roll of dingy paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0352.mp3|around which it had been twisted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0353.mp3|this i now opened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0354.mp3|and had the satisfaction to find recorded by the old surveyor's pen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0355.mp3|a reasonably complete explanation of the whole affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0357.mp3|containing many particulars respecting the life and conversation of one hester prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0359.mp3|she had flourished during the period between the early days of massachusetts and the close of the seventeenth century|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0362.mp3|and from whose oral testimony he had made up his narrative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0364.mp3|in their youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0366.mp3|but not decrepit woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0367.mp3|of a stately and solemn aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0368.mp3|it had been her habit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0369.mp3|from an almost immemorial date|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0370.mp3|to go about the country as a kind of voluntary nurse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0371.mp3|and doing whatever miscellaneous good she might|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0373.mp3|likewise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0374.mp3|to give advice in all matters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0375.mp3|especially those of the heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0376.mp3|by which means|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0378.mp3|she gained from many people the reverence due to an angel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0380.mp3|i should imagine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0381.mp3|was looked upon by others as an intruder and a nuisance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0382.mp3|prying further into the manuscript|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0383.mp3|i found the record of other doings and sufferings of this singular woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0384.mp3|for most of which the reader is referred to the story entitled the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0386.mp3|the original papers together with the scarlet letter itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0387.mp3|a most curious relic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0388.mp3|are still in my possession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0389.mp3|and shall be freely exhibited to whomsoever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0390.mp3|induced by the great interest of the narrative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0391.mp3|may desire a sight of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0393.mp3|in the dressing up of the tale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0394.mp3|and imagining the motives and modes of passion that influenced the characters who figure in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0396.mp3|on the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0397.mp3|i have allowed myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0398.mp3|as to such points|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0401.mp3|as much license as if the facts had been entirely of my own invention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0402.mp3|what i contend for is the authenticity of the outline|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0403.mp3|this incident recalled my mind in some degree to its old track|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0404.mp3|there seemed to be here the groundwork of a tale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0405.mp3|it impressed me as if the ancient surveyor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0406.mp3|in his garb of a hundred years gone by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0407.mp3|and wearing his immortal wig|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0408.mp3|which was buried with him but did not perish in the grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0409.mp3|had met me in the deserted chamber of the custom house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0410.mp3|in his port was the dignity of one who had borne his majesty's commission|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0411.mp3|and who was therefore illuminated by a ray of the splendour that shone so dazzlingly about the throne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0413.mp3|who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0414.mp3|as the servant of the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0415.mp3|feels himself less than the least|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0416.mp3|and below the lowest of his masters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0417.mp3|with his own ghostly hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0418.mp3|the obscurely seen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0421.mp3|with his own ghostly voice he had exhorted me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0422.mp3|on the sacred consideration of my filial duty and reverence towards him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0423.mp3|who might reasonably regard himself as my official ancestor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0424.mp3|to bring his mouldy and moth eaten lucubrations before the public|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0427.mp3|do this and the profit shall be all your own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0428.mp3|you will shortly need it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0429.mp3|for it is not in your days as it was in mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0430.mp3|when a man's office was a life lease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0432.mp3|but i charge you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0433.mp3|in this matter of old mistress prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0436.mp3|on hester prynne's story therefore i bestowed much thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0437.mp3|it was the subject of my meditations for many an hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0438.mp3|while pacing to and fro across my room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0440.mp3|with a hundredfold repetition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0441.mp3|the long extent from the front door of the custom house to the side entrance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0442.mp3|and back again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0444.mp3|whose slumbers were disturbed by the unmercifully lengthened tramp of my passing and returning footsteps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0445.mp3|remembering their own former habits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0446.mp3|they used to say that the surveyor was walking the quarter deck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0447.mp3|they probably fancied that my sole object|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0450.mp3|the sole object for which a sane man could ever put himself into voluntary motion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0451.mp3|was to get an appetite for dinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0453.mp3|to say the truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0454.mp3|an appetite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0455.mp3|sharpened by the east wind that generally blew along the passage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0456.mp3|was the only valuable result of so much indefatigable exercise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0457.mp3|so little adapted is the atmosphere of a custom house to the delicate harvest of fancy and sensibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0459.mp3|had i remained there through ten presidencies yet to come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0460.mp3|i doubt whether the tale of the scarlet letter would ever have been brought before the public eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0461.mp3|my imagination was a tarnished mirror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0462.mp3|it would not reflect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0463.mp3|or only with miserable dimness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0464.mp3|the figures with which i did my best to people it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0465.mp3|the characters of the narrative would not be warmed and rendered malleable by any heat that i could kindle at my intellectual forge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0466.mp3|they would take neither the glow of passion nor the tenderness of sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0467.mp3|but retained all the rigidity of dead corpses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0468.mp3|and stared me in the face with a fixed and ghastly grin of contemptuous defiance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0469.mp3|what have you to do with us that expression seemed to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0470.mp3|the little power you might have once possessed over the tribe of unrealities is gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0471.mp3|you have bartered it for a pittance of the public gold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0473.mp3|and earn your wages in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0474.mp3|the almost torpid creatures of my own fancy twitted me with imbecility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0475.mp3|and not without fair occasion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0476.mp3|it was not merely during the three hours and a half which uncle sam claimed as his share of my daily life that this wretched numbness held possession of me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0477.mp3|it went with me on my sea shore walks and rambles into the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0478.mp3|whenever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0479.mp3|which was seldom and reluctantly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0480.mp3|i bestirred myself to seek that invigorating charm of nature which used to give me such freshness and activity of thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0483.mp3|as regarded the capacity for intellectual effort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0484.mp3|accompanied me home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0485.mp3|and weighed upon me in the chamber which i most absurdly termed my study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0486.mp3|nor did it quit me when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0487.mp3|late at night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0488.mp3|i sat in the deserted parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0489.mp3|lighted only by the glimmering coal fire and the moon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0492.mp3|the next day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0494.mp3|if the imaginative faculty refused to act at such an hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0495.mp3|it might well be deemed a hopeless case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0497.mp3|in a familiar room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0498.mp3|falling so white upon the carpet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0499.mp3|and showing all its figures so distinctly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0500.mp3|making every object so minutely visible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0501.mp3|yet so unlike a morning or noontide visibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0503.mp3|there is the little domestic scenery of the well known apartment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0504.mp3|the chairs with each its separate individuality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0506.mp3|sustaining a work basket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0508.mp3|and an extinguished lamp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0510.mp3|the book case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0511.mp3|the picture on the wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0512.mp3|all these details|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0513.mp3|so completely seen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0516.mp3|and become things of intellect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0517.mp3|nothing is too small or too trifling to undergo this change|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0518.mp3|and acquire dignity thereby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0519.mp3|a child's shoe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0520.mp3|the doll seated in her little wicker carriage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0521.mp3|the hobby horse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0523.mp3|in a word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0524.mp3|has been used or played with during the day is now invested with a quality of strangeness and remoteness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0525.mp3|though still almost as vividly present as by daylight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0527.mp3|therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0528.mp3|the floor of our familiar room has become a neutral territory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0530.mp3|where the actual and the imaginary may meet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0531.mp3|and each imbue itself with the nature of the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0532.mp3|ghosts might enter here without affrighting us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0534.mp3|were we to look about us and discover a form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0536.mp3|but gone hence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0537.mp3|now sitting quietly in a streak of this magic moonshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0538.mp3|with an aspect that would make us doubt whether it had returned from afar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0539.mp3|or had never once stirred from our fireside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0540.mp3|the somewhat dim coal fire has an essential influence in producing the effect which i would describe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0541.mp3|it throws its unobtrusive tinge throughout the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0543.mp3|and a reflected gleam upon the polish of the furniture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0545.mp3|and communicates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0547.mp3|a heart and sensibilities of human tenderness to the forms which fancy summons up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0548.mp3|it converts them from snow images into men and women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0549.mp3|glancing at the looking glass we behold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0550.mp3|deep within its haunted verge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0551.mp3|the smouldering glow of the half extinguished anthracite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0553.mp3|and a repetition of all the gleam and shadow of the picture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0555.mp3|and nearer to the imaginative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0556.mp3|then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0557.mp3|at such an hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0558.mp3|and with this scene before him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0560.mp3|sitting all alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0561.mp3|cannot dream strange things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0562.mp3|and make them look like truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0563.mp3|he need never try to write romances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0566.mp3|during the whole of my custom house experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0569.mp3|were just alike in my regard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0570.mp3|and neither of them was of one whit more avail than the twinkle of a tallow candle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0571.mp3|an entire class of susceptibilities and a gift connected with them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0572.mp3|of no great richness or value but the best i had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0573.mp3|was gone from me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0574.mp3|it is my belief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0576.mp3|that had i attempted a different order of composition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0577.mp3|my faculties would not have been found so pointless and inefficacious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0578.mp3|i might|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0580.mp3|have contented myself with writing out the narratives of a veteran shipmaster|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0581.mp3|one of the inspectors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0582.mp3|whom i should be most ungrateful not to mention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0584.mp3|could i have preserved the picturesque force of his style|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0587.mp3|i honestly believe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0588.mp3|would have been something new in literature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0589.mp3|or i might readily have found a more serious task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0590.mp3|it was a folly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0591.mp3|with the materiality of this daily life pressing so intrusively upon me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0592.mp3|to attempt to fling myself back into another age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0593.mp3|or to insist on creating the semblance of a world out of airy matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0594.mp3|when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0595.mp3|at every moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0596.mp3|the impalpable beauty of my soap bubble was broken by the rude contact of some actual circumstance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0597.mp3|the wiser effort would have been to diffuse thought and imagination through the opaque substance of to day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0598.mp3|and thus to make it a bright transparency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0600.mp3|to seek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0601.mp3|resolutely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0602.mp3|the true and indestructible value that lay hidden in the petty and wearisome incidents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0603.mp3|and ordinary characters with which i was now conversant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0604.mp3|the fault was mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0605.mp3|the page of life that was spread out before me seemed dull and commonplace only because i had not fathomed its deeper import|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0606.mp3|a better book than i shall ever write was there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0607.mp3|leaf after leaf presenting itself to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0608.mp3|just as it was written out by the reality of the flitting hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0609.mp3|and vanishing as fast as written|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0612.mp3|to transcribe it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0615.mp3|i shall remember a few scattered fragments and broken paragraphs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0616.mp3|and write them down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0618.mp3|these perceptions had come too late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0621.mp3|there was no occasion to make much moan about this state of affairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0622.mp3|i had ceased to be a writer of tolerably poor tales and essays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0623.mp3|and had become a tolerably good surveyor of the customs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0624.mp3|that was all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0627.mp3|it is anything but agreeable to be haunted by a suspicion that one's intellect is dwindling away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0628.mp3|or exhaling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0629.mp3|without your consciousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0632.mp3|at every glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0633.mp3|you find a smaller and less volatile residuum|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0634.mp3|of the fact there could be no doubt and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0635.mp3|examining myself and others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0636.mp3|i was led to conclusions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0637.mp3|in reference to the effect of public office on the character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0638.mp3|not very favourable to the mode of life in question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0639.mp3|in some other form perhaps i may hereafter develop these effects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0640.mp3|suffice it here to say that a custom house officer of long continuance can hardly be a very praiseworthy or respectable personage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0641.mp3|for many reasons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0643.mp3|the tenure by which he holds his situation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0644.mp3|and another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0645.mp3|the very nature of his business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0647.mp3|though i trust an honest one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0650.mp3|which i believe to be observable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0652.mp3|in every individual who has occupied the position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0654.mp3|that while he leans on the mighty arm of the republic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0655.mp3|his own proper strength departs from him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0657.mp3|in an extent proportioned to the weakness or force of his original nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0658.mp3|the capability of self support|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0659.mp3|if he possesses an unusual share of native energy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0661.mp3|his forfeited powers may be redeemable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0662.mp3|the ejected officer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0663.mp3|fortunate in the unkindly shove that sends him forth betimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0664.mp3|to struggle amid a struggling world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0665.mp3|may return to himself and become all that he has ever been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0666.mp3|but this seldom happens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0667.mp3|he usually keeps his ground just long enough for his own ruin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0668.mp3|and is then thrust out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0670.mp3|to totter along the difficult footpath of life as he best may|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0671.mp3|conscious of his own infirmity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0672.mp3|that his tempered steel and elasticity are lost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0674.mp3|his pervading and continual hope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0677.mp3|in the face of all discouragement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0678.mp3|and making light of impossibilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0679.mp3|haunts him while he lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0682.mp3|like the convulsive throes of the cholera|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0683.mp3|torments him for a brief space after death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0685.mp3|that finally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0686.mp3|and in no long time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0687.mp3|by some happy coincidence of circumstances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0688.mp3|he shall be restored to office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0690.mp3|more than anything else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0691.mp3|steals the pith and availability out of whatever enterprise he may dream of undertaking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0692.mp3|why should he toil and moil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0693.mp3|and be at so much trouble to pick himself up out of the mud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0694.mp3|when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0695.mp3|in a little while hence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0696.mp3|the strong arm of his uncle will raise and support him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0697.mp3|why should he work for his living here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0699.mp3|when he is so soon to be made happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0700.mp3|at monthly intervals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0701.mp3|with a little pile of glittering coin out of his uncle's pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0702.mp3|it is sadly curious to observe how slight a taste of office suffices to infect a poor fellow with this singular disease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0703.mp3|uncle sam's gold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0706.mp3|in this respect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0707.mp3|a quality of enchantment like that of the devil's wages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0708.mp3|whoever touches it should look well to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0709.mp3|or he may find the bargain to go hard against him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0710.mp3|involving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0711.mp3|if not his soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0712.mp3|yet many of its better attributes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0714.mp3|its courage and constancy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0716.mp3|its self reliance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0718.mp3|here was a fine prospect in the distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0719.mp3|not that the surveyor brought the lesson home to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0720.mp3|or admitted that he could be so utterly undone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0721.mp3|either by continuance in office or ejectment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0722.mp3|yet my reflections were not the most comfortable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0723.mp3|i began to grow melancholy and restless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0724.mp3|continually prying into my mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0725.mp3|to discover which of its poor properties were gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0726.mp3|and what degree of detriment had already accrued to the remainder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0727.mp3|i endeavoured to calculate how much longer i could stay in the custom house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0728.mp3|and yet go forth a man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0729.mp3|to confess the truth it was my greatest apprehension|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0730.mp3|as it would never be a measure of policy to turn out so quiet an individual as myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0733.mp3|therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0735.mp3|and become much such another animal as the old inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0737.mp3|in the tedious lapse of official life that lay before me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0738.mp3|finally be with me as it was with this venerable friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0739.mp3|to make the dinner hour the nucleus of the day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0740.mp3|and to spend the rest of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0741.mp3|as an old dog spends it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0742.mp3|asleep in the sunshine or in the shade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0743.mp3|a dreary look forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0745.mp3|for a man who felt it to be the best definition of happiness to live throughout the whole range of his faculties and sensibilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0746.mp3|but all this while i was giving myself very unnecessary alarm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0747.mp3|providence had meditated better things for me than i could possibly imagine for myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0748.mp3|a remarkable event of the third year of my surveyorship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0749.mp3|to adopt the tone of p p|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0750.mp3|was the election of general taylor to the presidency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0751.mp3|it is essential|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0754.mp3|his position is then one of the most singularly irksome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0757.mp3|disagreeable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0758.mp3|that a wretched mortal can possibly occupy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0759.mp3|with seldom an alternative of good on either hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0761.mp3|but it is a strange experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0762.mp3|to a man of pride and sensibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0763.mp3|to know that his interests are within the control of individuals who neither love nor understand him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0764.mp3|and by whom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0765.mp3|since one or the other must needs happen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0766.mp3|he would rather be injured than obliged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0769.mp3|for one who has kept his calmness throughout the contest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0770.mp3|to observe the bloodthirstiness that is developed in the hour of triumph|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0771.mp3|and to be conscious that he is himself among its objects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0773.mp3|which i now witnessed in men no worse than their neighbours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0774.mp3|to grow cruel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0775.mp3|merely because they possessed the power of inflicting harm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0776.mp3|if the guillotine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0777.mp3|as applied to office holders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0778.mp3|were a literal fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0779.mp3|instead of one of the most apt of metaphors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0780.mp3|it is my sincere belief that the active members of the victorious party were sufficiently excited to have chopped off all our heads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0781.mp3|and have thanked heaven for the opportunity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0782.mp3|it appears to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0783.mp3|who have been a calm and curious observer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0784.mp3|as well in victory as defeat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0785.mp3|that this fierce and bitter spirit of malice and revenge has never distinguished the many triumphs of my own party as it now did that of the whigs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0786.mp3|the democrats take the offices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0788.mp3|because they need them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0789.mp3|and because the practice of many years has made it the law of political warfare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0790.mp3|which unless a different system be proclaimed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0792.mp3|but the long habit of victory has made them generous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0793.mp3|they know how to spare when they see occasion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0794.mp3|and when they strike|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0795.mp3|the axe may be sharp indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0796.mp3|but its edge is seldom poisoned with ill will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0797.mp3|nor is it their custom ignominiously to kick the head which they have just struck off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0798.mp3|in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0799.mp3|unpleasant as was my predicament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0800.mp3|at best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0801.mp3|i saw much reason to congratulate myself that i was on the losing side rather than the triumphant one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0804.mp3|i had been none of the warmest of partisans i began now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0806.mp3|to be pretty acutely sensible with which party my predilections lay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0807.mp3|nor was it without something like regret and shame that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0808.mp3|according to a reasonable calculation of chances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0809.mp3|i saw my own prospect of retaining office to be better than those of my democratic brethren|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0811.mp3|my own head was the first that fell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0812.mp3|the moment when a man's head drops off is seldom or never|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0813.mp3|i am inclined to think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0814.mp3|precisely the most agreeable of his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0816.mp3|like the greater part of our misfortunes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0817.mp3|even so serious a contingency brings its remedy and consolation with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0818.mp3|if the sufferer will but make the best rather than the worst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0819.mp3|of the accident which has befallen him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0820.mp3|in my particular case the consolatory topics were close at hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0822.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0823.mp3|had suggested themselves to my meditations a considerable time before it was requisite to use them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0825.mp3|and vague thoughts of resignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0826.mp3|my fortune somewhat resembled that of a person who should entertain an idea of committing suicide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0827.mp3|and although beyond his hopes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0829.mp3|in the custom house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0831.mp3|i had spent three years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0832.mp3|a term long enough to rest a weary brain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0834.mp3|and make room for new ones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0836.mp3|and too long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0837.mp3|to have lived in an unnatural state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0838.mp3|doing what was really of no advantage nor delight to any human being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0839.mp3|and withholding myself from toil that would|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0844.mp3|as regarded his unceremonious ejectment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0848.mp3|at will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0850.mp3|rather than confine himself to those narrow paths where brethren of the same household must diverge from one another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0851.mp3|had sometimes made it questionable with his brother democrats whether he was a friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0853.mp3|after he had won the crown of martyrdom though with no longer a head to wear it on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0854.mp3|the point might be looked upon as settled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0856.mp3|little heroic as he was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0857.mp3|it seemed more decorous to be overthrown in the downfall of the party with which he had been content to stand than to remain a forlorn survivor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0858.mp3|when so many worthier men were falling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0859.mp3|and at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0860.mp3|after subsisting for four years on the mercy of a hostile administration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0862.mp3|and claim the yet more humiliating mercy of a friendly one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0863.mp3|meanwhile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0864.mp3|the press had taken up my affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0866.mp3|in my decapitated state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0868.mp3|ghastly and grim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0869.mp3|and longing to be buried|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0870.mp3|as a political dead man ought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0871.mp3|so much for my figurative self|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0872.mp3|the real human being all this time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0873.mp3|with his head safely on his shoulders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0874.mp3|had brought himself to the comfortable conclusion that everything was for the best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0875.mp3|and making an investment in ink|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0877.mp3|and steel pens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0878.mp3|had opened his long disused writing desk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0879.mp3|and was again a literary man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0882.mp3|came into play|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0883.mp3|rusty through long idleness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0884.mp3|some little space was requisite before my intellectual machinery could be brought to work upon the tale with an effect in any degree satisfactory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0885.mp3|even yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0886.mp3|though my thoughts were ultimately much absorbed in the task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0888.mp3|to my eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0889.mp3|a stern and sombre aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0890.mp3|too much ungladdened by genial sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0891.mp3|too little relieved by the tender and familiar influences which soften almost every scene of nature and real life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0892.mp3|and undoubtedly should soften every picture of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0893.mp3|this uncaptivating effect is perhaps due to the period of hardly accomplished revolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0895.mp3|in which the story shaped itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0896.mp3|it is no indication|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0898.mp3|of a lack of cheerfulness in the writer's mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0900.mp3|some of the briefer articles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0901.mp3|which contribute to make up the volume|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0902.mp3|have likewise been written since my involuntary withdrawal from the toils and honours of public life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0903.mp3|and the remainder are gleaned from annuals and magazines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0904.mp3|of such antique date|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0906.mp3|and come back to novelty again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0907.mp3|keeping up the metaphor of the political guillotine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0908.mp3|the whole may be considered as the posthumous papers of a decapitated surveyor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0909.mp3|and the sketch which i am now bringing to a close|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0910.mp3|if too autobiographical for a modest person to publish in his lifetime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0912.mp3|peace be with all the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0913.mp3|my blessing on my friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0914.mp3|my forgiveness to my enemies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0915.mp3|for i am in the realm of quiet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0916.mp3|the life of the custom house lies like a dream behind me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0917.mp3|the old inspector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0920.mp3|i regret to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0921.mp3|was overthrown and killed by a horse some time ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0922.mp3|else he would certainly have lived for ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0923.mp3|he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0924.mp3|and all those other venerable personages who sat with him at the receipt of custom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0925.mp3|are but shadows in my view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0926.mp3|white headed and wrinkled images|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0927.mp3|which my fancy used to sport with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0928.mp3|and has now flung aside for ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0929.mp3|the merchants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0931.mp3|these and many other names|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0932.mp3|which had such classic familiarity for my ear six months ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0933.mp3|these men of traffic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0934.mp3|who seemed to occupy so important a position in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0935.mp3|how little time has it required to disconnect me from them all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0937.mp3|but recollection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0938.mp3|it is with an effort that i recall the figures and appellations of these few|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0941.mp3|my old native town will loom upon me through the haze of memory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0942.mp3|a mist brooding over and around it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0943.mp3|as if it were no portion of the real earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0944.mp3|but an overgrown village in cloud land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0945.mp3|with only imaginary inhabitants to people its wooden houses and walk its homely lanes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0946.mp3|and the unpicturesque prolixity of its main street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0947.mp3|henceforth it ceases to be a reality of my life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0949.mp3|my good townspeople will not much regret me for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0951.mp3|in my literary efforts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0952.mp3|to be of some importance in their eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0953.mp3|and to win myself a pleasant memory in this abode and burial place of so many of my forefathers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0954.mp3|there has never been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0955.mp3|for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0956.mp3|the genial atmosphere which a literary man requires in order to ripen the best harvest of his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0957.mp3|i shall do better amongst other faces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0958.mp3|and these familiar ones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0959.mp3|it need hardly be said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0960.mp3|will do just as well without me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0961.mp3|it may be however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_00c_hawthorne_0964.mp3|when the antiquary of days to come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0001.mp3|in sad coloured garments and grey steeple crowned hats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0004.mp3|and others bareheaded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0005.mp3|was assembled in front of a wooden edifice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0006.mp3|the door of which was heavily timbered with oak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0007.mp3|and studded with iron spikes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0008.mp3|the founders of a new colony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0009.mp3|whatever utopia of human virtue and happiness they might originally project|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0011.mp3|and another portion as the site of a prison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0013.mp3|almost as seasonably as they marked out the first burial ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0014.mp3|on isaac johnson's lot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0015.mp3|and round about his grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0017.mp3|certain it is that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0018.mp3|some fifteen or twenty years after the settlement of the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0019.mp3|the wooden jail was already marked with weather stains and other indications of age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0020.mp3|which gave a yet darker aspect to its beetle browed and gloomy front|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0021.mp3|the rust on the ponderous iron work of its oaken door looked more antique than anything else in the new world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0022.mp3|like all that pertains to crime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0024.mp3|before this ugly edifice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0025.mp3|and between it and the wheel track of the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0026.mp3|was a grass plot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0027.mp3|much overgrown with burdock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0030.mp3|and such unsightly vegetation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0033.mp3|but on one side of the portal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0034.mp3|and rooted almost at the threshold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0035.mp3|was a wild rose bush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0037.mp3|in this month of june|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0038.mp3|with its delicate gems|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0039.mp3|which might be imagined to offer their fragrance and fragile beauty to the prisoner as he went in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0041.mp3|in token that the deep heart of nature could pity and be kind to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0042.mp3|this rose bush by a strange chance has been kept alive in history|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0043.mp3|but whether it had merely survived out of the stern old wilderness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0044.mp3|so long after the fall of the gigantic pines and oaks that originally overshadowed it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0046.mp3|as there is fair authority for believing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0048.mp3|we shall not take upon us to determine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0049.mp3|finding it so directly on the threshold of our narrative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0050.mp3|which is now about to issue from that inauspicious portal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_01_hawthorne_0052.mp3|and present it to the reader|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0000.mp3|the grass plot before the jail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0001.mp3|in prison lane|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0002.mp3|on a certain summer morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0003.mp3|not less than two centuries ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0004.mp3|was occupied by a pretty large number of the inhabitants of boston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0005.mp3|all with their eyes intently fastened on the iron clamped oaken door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0006.mp3|amongst any other population|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0007.mp3|or at a later period in the history of new england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0009.mp3|it could have betokened nothing short of the anticipated execution of some noted culprit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0010.mp3|on whom the sentence of a legal tribunal had but confirmed the verdict of public sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0011.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0012.mp3|in that early severity of the puritan character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0013.mp3|an inference of this kind could not so indubitably be drawn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0014.mp3|it might be that a sluggish bond servant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0015.mp3|or an undutiful child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0016.mp3|whom his parents had given over to the civil authority|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0017.mp3|was to be corrected at the whipping post|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0019.mp3|a quaker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0020.mp3|or other heterodox religionist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0021.mp3|was to be scourged out of the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0022.mp3|or an idle or vagrant indian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0023.mp3|whom the white man's firewater had made riotous about the streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0024.mp3|was to be driven with stripes into the shadow of the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0028.mp3|like old mistress hibbins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0029.mp3|the bitter tempered widow of the magistrate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0030.mp3|was to die upon the gallows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0031.mp3|in either case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0032.mp3|there was very much the same solemnity of demeanour on the part of the spectators|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0033.mp3|as befitted a people among whom religion and law were almost identical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0034.mp3|and in whose character both were so thoroughly interfused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0035.mp3|that the mildest and severest acts of public discipline were alike made venerable and awful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0039.mp3|was the sympathy that a transgressor might look for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0040.mp3|from such bystanders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0041.mp3|at the scaffold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0042.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0043.mp3|a penalty which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0044.mp3|in our days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0045.mp3|would infer a degree of mocking infamy and ridicule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0046.mp3|might then be invested with almost as stern a dignity as the punishment of death itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0047.mp3|it was a circumstance to be noted on the summer morning when our story begins its course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0049.mp3|of whom there were several in the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0050.mp3|appeared to take a peculiar interest in whatever penal infliction might be expected to ensue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0051.mp3|the age had not so much refinement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0052.mp3|that any sense of impropriety restrained the wearers of petticoat and farthingale from stepping forth into the public ways|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0054.mp3|if occasion were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0055.mp3|into the throng nearest to the scaffold at an execution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0057.mp3|as well as materially|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0059.mp3|separated from them by a series of six or seven generations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0061.mp3|throughout that chain of ancestry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0062.mp3|every successive mother had transmitted to her child a fainter bloom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0063.mp3|a more delicate and briefer beauty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0064.mp3|and a slighter physical frame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0065.mp3|if not character of less force and solidity than her own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0066.mp3|the women who were now standing about the prison door stood within less than half a century of the period when the man like elizabeth had been the not altogether unsuitable representative of the sex|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0067.mp3|they were her countrywomen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0068.mp3|and the beef and ale of their native land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0069.mp3|with a moral diet not a whit more refined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0070.mp3|entered largely into their composition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0074.mp3|and on round and ruddy cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0075.mp3|that had ripened in the far off island|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0076.mp3|and had hardly yet grown paler or thinner in the atmosphere of new england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0080.mp3|as most of them seemed to be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0081.mp3|that would startle us at the present day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0082.mp3|whether in respect to its purport or its volume of tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0083.mp3|goodwives said a hard featured dame of fifty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0084.mp3|i'll tell ye a piece of my mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0086.mp3|being of mature age and church members in good repute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0089.mp3|if the hussy stood up for judgment before us five|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0091.mp3|would she come off with such a sentence as the worshipful magistrates have awarded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0092.mp3|marry i trow not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0093.mp3|people say said another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0094.mp3|that the reverend master dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0095.mp3|her godly pastor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0096.mp3|takes it very grievously to heart that such a scandal should have come upon his congregation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0099.mp3|at the very least|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0100.mp3|they should have put the brand of a hot iron on hester prynne's forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0101.mp3|madame hester would have winced at that i warrant me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0103.mp3|the naughty baggage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0108.mp3|or such like heathenish adornment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0109.mp3|and so walk the streets as brave as ever ah|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0112.mp3|a young wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0113.mp3|holding a child by the hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0114.mp3|let her cover the mark as she will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0116.mp3|what do we talk of marks and brands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0117.mp3|whether on the bodice of her gown or the flesh of her forehead cried another female|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0118.mp3|the ugliest as well as the most pitiless of these self constituted judges|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0119.mp3|this woman has brought shame upon us all and ought to die|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0120.mp3|is there not law for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0121.mp3|truly there is both in the scripture and the statute book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0122.mp3|then let the magistrates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0123.mp3|who have made it of no effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0124.mp3|thank themselves if their own wives and daughters go astray|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0128.mp3|save what springs from a wholesome fear of the gallows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0129.mp3|that is the hardest word yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0132.mp3|and here comes mistress prynne herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0133.mp3|the door of the jail being flung open from within there appeared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0134.mp3|in the first place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0135.mp3|like a black shadow emerging into sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0137.mp3|with a sword by his side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0138.mp3|and his staff of office in his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0139.mp3|this personage prefigured and represented in his aspect the whole dismal severity of the puritanic code of law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0140.mp3|which it was his business to administer in its final and closest application to the offender|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0141.mp3|stretching forth the official staff in his left hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0142.mp3|he laid his right upon the shoulder of a young woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0143.mp3|whom he thus drew forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0144.mp3|until|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0145.mp3|on the threshold of the prison door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0146.mp3|she repelled him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0147.mp3|by an action marked with natural dignity and force of character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0148.mp3|and stepped into the open air as if by her own free will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0149.mp3|she bore in her arms a child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0150.mp3|a baby of some three months old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0151.mp3|who winked and turned aside its little face from the too vivid light of day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0152.mp3|because its existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0154.mp3|had brought it acquaintance only with the grey twilight of a dungeon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0155.mp3|or other darksome apartment of the prison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0156.mp3|when the young woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0157.mp3|the mother of this child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0158.mp3|stood fully revealed before the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0159.mp3|it seemed to be her first impulse to clasp the infant closely to her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0160.mp3|not so much by an impulse of motherly affection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0161.mp3|as that she might thereby conceal a certain token|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0162.mp3|which was wrought or fastened into her dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0165.mp3|wisely judging that one token of her shame would but poorly serve to hide another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0166.mp3|she took the baby on her arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0167.mp3|and with a burning blush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0168.mp3|and yet a haughty smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0169.mp3|and a glance that would not be abashed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0170.mp3|looked around at her townspeople and neighbours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0171.mp3|on the breast of her gown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0172.mp3|in fine red cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0173.mp3|surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0174.mp3|appeared the letter a it was so artistically done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0175.mp3|and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0176.mp3|that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0177.mp3|and which was of a splendour in accordance with the taste of the age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0178.mp3|but greatly beyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0179.mp3|the young woman was tall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0180.mp3|with a figure of perfect elegance on a large scale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0181.mp3|she had dark and abundant hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0182.mp3|so glossy that it threw off the sunshine with a gleam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0183.mp3|and a face which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0184.mp3|besides being beautiful from regularity of feature and richness of complexion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0186.mp3|she was ladylike|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0188.mp3|after the manner of the feminine gentility of those days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0190.mp3|rather than by the delicate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0193.mp3|and never had hester prynne appeared more ladylike|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0194.mp3|in the antique interpretation of the term|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0195.mp3|than as she issued from the prison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0196.mp3|those who had before known her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0197.mp3|and had expected to behold her dimmed and obscured by a disastrous cloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0198.mp3|were astonished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0199.mp3|and even startled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0200.mp3|to perceive how her beauty shone out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0201.mp3|and made a halo of the misfortune and ignominy in which she was enveloped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0202.mp3|it may be true that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0203.mp3|to a sensitive observer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0207.mp3|she had wrought for the occasion in prison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0208.mp3|and had modelled much after her own fancy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0209.mp3|seemed to express the attitude of her spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0210.mp3|the desperate recklessness of her mood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0211.mp3|by its wild and picturesque peculiarity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0212.mp3|but the point which drew all eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0215.mp3|transfigured the wearer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0216.mp3|so that both men and women who had been familiarly acquainted with hester prynne were now impressed as if they beheld her for the first time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0218.mp3|so fantastically embroidered and illuminated upon her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0219.mp3|it had the effect of a spell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0220.mp3|taking her out of the ordinary relations with humanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0221.mp3|and enclosing her in a sphere by herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0223.mp3|that's certain remarked one of her female spectators|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0224.mp3|but did ever a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0225.mp3|before this brazen hussy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0226.mp3|contrive such a way of showing it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0229.mp3|what is it but to laugh in the faces of our godly magistrates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0230.mp3|and make a pride out of what they|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0231.mp3|worthy gentlemen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0232.mp3|meant for a punishment it were well muttered the most iron visaged of the old dames|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0233.mp3|if we stripped madame hester's rich gown off her dainty shoulders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0234.mp3|and as for the red letter which she hath stitched so curiously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0239.mp3|do not let her hear you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0240.mp3|not a stitch in that embroidered letter but she has felt it in her heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0242.mp3|make way good people make way in the king's name cried he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0244.mp3|and i promise ye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0248.mp3|a blessing on the righteous colony of the massachusetts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0249.mp3|where iniquity is dragged out into the sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0253.mp3|preceded by the beadle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0254.mp3|and attended by an irregular procession of stern browed men and unkindly visaged women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0256.mp3|a crowd of eager and curious schoolboys|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0257.mp3|understanding little of the matter in hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0258.mp3|except that it gave them a half holiday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0259.mp3|ran before her progress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0260.mp3|turning their heads continually to stare into her face and at the winking baby in her arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0261.mp3|and at the ignominious letter on her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0262.mp3|it was no great distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0263.mp3|in those days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0264.mp3|from the prison door to the market place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0265.mp3|measured by the prisoner's experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0267.mp3|it might be reckoned a journey of some length|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0268.mp3|for haughty as her demeanour was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0269.mp3|she perchance underwent an agony from every footstep of those that thronged to see her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0270.mp3|as if her heart had been flung into the street for them all to spurn and trample upon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0273.mp3|there is a provision|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0274.mp3|alike marvellous and merciful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0275.mp3|that the sufferer should never know the intensity of what he endures by its present torture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0276.mp3|but chiefly by the pang that rankles after it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0279.mp3|hester prynne passed through this portion of her ordeal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0280.mp3|and came to a sort of scaffold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0281.mp3|at the western extremity of the market place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0282.mp3|it stood nearly beneath the eaves of boston's earliest church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0283.mp3|and appeared to be a fixture there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0286.mp3|which now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0287.mp3|for two or three generations past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0288.mp3|has been merely historical and traditionary among us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0289.mp3|but was held|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0290.mp3|in the old time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0291.mp3|to be as effectual an agent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0292.mp3|in the promotion of good citizenship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0293.mp3|as ever was the guillotine among the terrorists of france|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0295.mp3|and above it rose the framework of that instrument of discipline|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0296.mp3|so fashioned as to confine the human head in its tight grasp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0297.mp3|and thus hold it up to the public gaze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0298.mp3|the very ideal of ignominy was embodied and made manifest in this contrivance of wood and iron|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0299.mp3|there can be no outrage methinks against our common nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0300.mp3|whatever be the delinquencies of the individual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0301.mp3|no outrage more flagrant than to forbid the culprit to hide his face for shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0302.mp3|as it was the essence of this punishment to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0305.mp3|as not unfrequently in other cases|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0306.mp3|her sentence bore that she should stand a certain time upon the platform|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0308.mp3|the proneness to which was the most devilish characteristic of this ugly engine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0309.mp3|knowing well her part|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0310.mp3|she ascended a flight of wooden steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0311.mp3|and was thus displayed to the surrounding multitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0313.mp3|had there been a papist among the crowd of puritans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0314.mp3|he might have seen in this beautiful woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0316.mp3|and with the infant at her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0321.mp3|but only by contrast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0322.mp3|of that sacred image of sinless motherhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0323.mp3|whose infant was to redeem the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0325.mp3|there was the taint of deepest sin in the most sacred quality of human life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0326.mp3|working such effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0327.mp3|that the world was only the darker for this woman's beauty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0328.mp3|and the more lost for the infant that she had borne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0329.mp3|the scene was not without a mixture of awe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0330.mp3|such as must always invest the spectacle of guilt and shame in a fellow creature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0331.mp3|before society shall have grown corrupt enough to smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0332.mp3|instead of shuddering at it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0333.mp3|the witnesses of hester prynne's disgrace had not yet passed beyond their simplicity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0334.mp3|they were stern enough to look upon her death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0335.mp3|had that been the sentence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0336.mp3|without a murmur at its severity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0337.mp3|but had none of the heartlessness of another social state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0339.mp3|even had there been a disposition to turn the matter into ridicule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0340.mp3|it must have been repressed and overpowered by the solemn presence of men no less dignified than the governor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0341.mp3|and several of his counsellors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0342.mp3|a judge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0344.mp3|and the ministers of the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0345.mp3|all of whom sat or stood in a balcony of the meeting house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0346.mp3|looking down upon the platform|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0347.mp3|when such personages could constitute a part of the spectacle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0348.mp3|without risking the majesty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0349.mp3|or reverence of rank and office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0350.mp3|it was safely to be inferred that the infliction of a legal sentence would have an earnest and effectual meaning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0352.mp3|the unhappy culprit sustained herself as best a woman might|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0353.mp3|under the heavy weight of a thousand unrelenting eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0354.mp3|all fastened upon her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0355.mp3|and concentrated at her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0357.mp3|of an impulsive and passionate nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0360.mp3|but there was a quality so much more terrible in the solemn mood of the popular mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0361.mp3|that she longed rather to behold all those rigid countenances contorted with scornful merriment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0362.mp3|and herself the object|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0363.mp3|had a roar of laughter burst from the multitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0365.mp3|each woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0366.mp3|each little shrill voiced child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0367.mp3|contributing their individual parts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0372.mp3|at moments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0373.mp3|as if she must needs shriek out with the full power of her lungs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0374.mp3|and cast herself from the scaffold down upon the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0375.mp3|or else go mad at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0376.mp3|yet there were intervals when the whole scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0377.mp3|in which she was the most conspicuous object|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0378.mp3|seemed to vanish from her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0381.mp3|glimmered indistinctly before them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0382.mp3|like a mass of imperfectly shaped and spectral images|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0383.mp3|her mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0384.mp3|and especially her memory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0385.mp3|was preternaturally active|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0386.mp3|and kept bringing up other scenes than this roughly hewn street of a little town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0387.mp3|on the edge of the western wilderness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0388.mp3|other faces than were lowering upon her from beneath the brims of those steeple crowned hats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0389.mp3|reminiscences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0390.mp3|the most trifling and immaterial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0391.mp3|passages of infancy and school days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0393.mp3|childish quarrels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0394.mp3|and the little domestic traits of her maiden years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0395.mp3|came swarming back upon her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0396.mp3|intermingled with recollections of whatever was gravest in her subsequent life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0397.mp3|one picture precisely as vivid as another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0398.mp3|as if all were of similar importance or all alike a play|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0400.mp3|it was an instinctive device of her spirit to relieve itself by the exhibition of these phantasmagoric forms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0401.mp3|from the cruel weight and hardness of the reality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0402.mp3|be that as it might|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0404.mp3|since her happy infancy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0405.mp3|standing on that miserable eminence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0406.mp3|she saw again her native village|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0407.mp3|in old england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0408.mp3|and her paternal home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0409.mp3|a decayed house of grey stone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0410.mp3|with a poverty stricken aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0411.mp3|but retaining a half obliterated shield of arms over the portal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0412.mp3|in token of antique gentility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0413.mp3|she saw her father's face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0414.mp3|with its bold brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0415.mp3|and reverend white beard that flowed over the old fashioned elizabethan ruff|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0418.mp3|with the look of heedful and anxious love which it always wore in her remembrance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0419.mp3|and which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0420.mp3|even since her death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0421.mp3|had so often laid the impediment of a gentle remonstrance in her daughter's pathway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0422.mp3|she saw her own face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0423.mp3|glowing with girlish beauty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0424.mp3|and illuminating all the interior of the dusky mirror in which she had been wont to gaze at it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0425.mp3|there she beheld another countenance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0426.mp3|of a man well stricken in years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0429.mp3|scholar like visage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0432.mp3|penetrating power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0433.mp3|when it was their owner's purpose to read the human soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0434.mp3|this figure of the study and the cloister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0436.mp3|was slightly deformed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0437.mp3|with the left shoulder a trifle higher than the right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0438.mp3|next rose before her in memory's picture gallery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0439.mp3|the intricate and narrow thoroughfares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0442.mp3|the huge cathedrals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0444.mp3|ancient in date and quaint in architecture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0445.mp3|of a continental city|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0449.mp3|but feeding itself on time worn materials|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0450.mp3|like a tuft of green moss on a crumbling wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0452.mp3|in lieu of these shifting scenes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0453.mp3|came back the rude market place of the puritan settlement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0454.mp3|with all the townspeople assembled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0457.mp3|who stood on the scaffold of the pillory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0458.mp3|an infant on her arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0459.mp3|and the letter a|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0460.mp3|in scarlet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0461.mp3|fantastically embroidered with gold thread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0462.mp3|upon her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0463.mp3|could it be true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0464.mp3|she clutched the child so fiercely to her breast that it sent forth a cry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0465.mp3|she turned her eyes downward at the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0466.mp3|and even touched it with her finger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0467.mp3|to assure herself that the infant and the shame were real|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_02_hawthorne_0468.mp3|yes these were her realities all else had vanished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0001.mp3|the wearer of the scarlet letter was at length relieved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0002.mp3|by discerning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0003.mp3|on the outskirts of the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0004.mp3|a figure which irresistibly took possession of her thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0005.mp3|an indian in his native garb was standing there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0006.mp3|but the red men were not so infrequent visitors of the english settlements that one of them would have attracted any notice from hester prynne at such a time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0007.mp3|much less would he have excluded all other objects and ideas from her mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0008.mp3|by the indian's side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0009.mp3|and evidently sustaining a companionship with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0010.mp3|stood a white man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0011.mp3|clad in a strange disarray of civilized and savage costume|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0012.mp3|he was small in stature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0013.mp3|with a furrowed visage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0014.mp3|which as yet could hardly be termed aged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0015.mp3|there was a remarkable intelligence in his features|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0016.mp3|as of a person who had so cultivated his mental part that it could not fail to mould the physical to itself and become manifest by unmistakable tokens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0018.mp3|by a seemingly careless arrangement of his heterogeneous garb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0019.mp3|he had endeavoured to conceal or abate the peculiarity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0022.mp3|at the first instant of perceiving that thin visage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0023.mp3|and the slight deformity of the figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0024.mp3|she pressed her infant to her bosom with so convulsive a force that the poor babe uttered another cry of pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0025.mp3|but the mother did not seem to hear it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0026.mp3|at his arrival in the market place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0027.mp3|and some time before she saw him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0029.mp3|it was carelessly at first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0031.mp3|and to whom external matters are of little value and import|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0032.mp3|unless they bear relation to something within his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0033.mp3|very soon however his look became keen and penetrative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0034.mp3|a writhing horror twisted itself across his features|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0035.mp3|like a snake gliding swiftly over them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0036.mp3|and making one little pause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0037.mp3|with all its wreathed intervolutions in open sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0038.mp3|his face darkened with some powerful emotion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0040.mp3|nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0041.mp3|he so instantaneously controlled by an effort of his will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0044.mp3|its expression might have passed for calmness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0045.mp3|after a brief space|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0046.mp3|the convulsion grew almost imperceptible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0047.mp3|and finally subsided into the depths of his nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0048.mp3|when he found the eyes of hester prynne fastened on his own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0049.mp3|and saw that she appeared to recognize him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0050.mp3|he slowly and calmly raised his finger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0051.mp3|made a gesture with it in the air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0052.mp3|and laid it on his lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0054.mp3|he addressed him in a formal and courteous manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0055.mp3|i pray you good sir said he who is this woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0056.mp3|and wherefore is she here set up to public shame you must needs be a stranger in this region|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0057.mp3|friend answered the townsman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0058.mp3|looking curiously at the questioner and his savage companion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0062.mp3|in godly master dimmesdale's church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0063.mp3|you say truly replied the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0064.mp3|i am a stranger and have been a wanderer sorely against my will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0065.mp3|i have met with grievous mishaps by sea and land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0066.mp3|and have been long held in bonds among the heathen folk to the southward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0067.mp3|and am now brought hither by this indian to be redeemed out of my captivity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0069.mp3|have i her name rightly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0070.mp3|of this woman's offences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0071.mp3|and what has brought her to yonder scaffold truly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0073.mp3|and methinks it must gladden your heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0074.mp3|after your troubles and sojourn in the wilderness said the townsman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0075.mp3|to find yourself at length in a land where iniquity is searched out and punished in the sight of rulers and people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0076.mp3|as here in our godly new england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0079.mp3|you must know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0080.mp3|was the wife of a certain learned man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0081.mp3|english by birth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0082.mp3|but who had long ago dwelt in amsterdam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0083.mp3|whence some good time agone he was minded to cross over and cast in his lot with us of the massachusetts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0084.mp3|to this purpose he sent his wife before him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0085.mp3|remaining himself to look after some necessary affairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0090.mp3|that the woman has been a dweller here in boston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0091.mp3|no tidings have come of this learned gentleman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0096.mp3|i conceive you said the stranger with a bitter smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0097.mp3|so learned a man as you speak of should have learned this too in his books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0098.mp3|and who by your favour sir may be the father of yonder babe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0099.mp3|it is some three or four months old i should judge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0102.mp3|that matter remaineth a riddle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0103.mp3|and the daniel who shall expound it is yet a wanting answered the townsman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0105.mp3|and the magistrates have laid their heads together in vain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0106.mp3|peradventure the guilty one stands looking on at this sad spectacle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0108.mp3|and forgetting that god sees him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0109.mp3|the learned man observed the stranger with another smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0110.mp3|should come himself to look into the mystery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0111.mp3|it behoves him well if he be still in life responded the townsman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0115.mp3|bethinking themselves that this woman is youthful and fair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0116.mp3|and doubtless was strongly tempted to her fall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0118.mp3|moreover|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0119.mp3|as is most likely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0120.mp3|her husband may be at the bottom of the sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0121.mp3|they have not been bold to put in force the extremity of our righteous law against her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0122.mp3|the penalty thereof is death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0123.mp3|but in their great mercy and tenderness of heart they have doomed mistress prynne to stand only a space of three hours on the platform of the pillory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0124.mp3|and then and thereafter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0125.mp3|for the remainder of her natural life to wear a mark of shame upon her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0126.mp3|a wise sentence remarked the stranger gravely bowing his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0127.mp3|thus she will be a living sermon against sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0128.mp3|until the ignominious letter be engraved upon her tombstone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0131.mp3|that the partner of her iniquity should not at least|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0132.mp3|stand on the scaffold by her side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0133.mp3|but he will be known he will be known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0134.mp3|he will be known he bowed courteously to the communicative townsman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0135.mp3|and whispering a few words to his indian attendant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0136.mp3|they both made their way through the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0137.mp3|while this passed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0138.mp3|hester prynne had been standing on her pedestal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0139.mp3|still with a fixed gaze towards the stranger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0140.mp3|so fixed a gaze that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0141.mp3|at moments of intense absorption|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0142.mp3|all other objects in the visible world seemed to vanish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0143.mp3|leaving only him and her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0146.mp3|would have been more terrible than even to meet him as she now did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0148.mp3|and lighting up its shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0149.mp3|with the scarlet token of infamy on her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0150.mp3|with the sin born infant in her arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0152.mp3|drawn forth as to a festival|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0153.mp3|staring at the features that should have been seen only in the quiet gleam of the fireside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0154.mp3|in the happy shadow of a home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0156.mp3|dreadful as it was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0157.mp3|she was conscious of a shelter in the presence of these thousand witnesses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0158.mp3|it was better to stand thus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0159.mp3|with so many betwixt him and her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0160.mp3|than to greet him face to face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0162.mp3|she fled for refuge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0164.mp3|to the public exposure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0165.mp3|and dreaded the moment when its protection should be withdrawn from her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0166.mp3|involved in these thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0167.mp3|she scarcely heard a voice behind her until it had repeated her name more than once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0168.mp3|in a loud and solemn tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0169.mp3|audible to the whole multitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0172.mp3|or open gallery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0173.mp3|appended to the meeting house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0174.mp3|it was the place whence proclamations were wont to be made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0175.mp3|amidst an assemblage of the magistracy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0176.mp3|with all the ceremonial that attended such public observances in those days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0178.mp3|to witness the scene which we are describing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0179.mp3|sat governor bellingham himself with four sergeants about his chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0180.mp3|bearing halberds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0182.mp3|he wore a dark feather in his hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0183.mp3|a border of embroidery on his cloak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0184.mp3|and a black velvet tunic beneath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0185.mp3|a gentleman advanced in years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0186.mp3|with a hard experience written in his wrinkles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0187.mp3|he was not ill fitted to be the head and representative of a community which owed its origin and progress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0188.mp3|and its present state of development|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0189.mp3|not to the impulses of youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0190.mp3|but to the stern and tempered energies of manhood and the sombre sagacity of age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0191.mp3|accomplishing so much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0192.mp3|precisely because it imagined and hoped so little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0194.mp3|belonging to a period when the forms of authority were felt to possess the sacredness of divine institutions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0195.mp3|they were doubtless good men just and sage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0197.mp3|out of the whole human family|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0198.mp3|it would not have been easy to select the same number of wise and virtuous persons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0199.mp3|who should be less capable of sitting in judgment on an erring woman's heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0200.mp3|and disentangling its mesh of good and evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0204.mp3|that whatever sympathy she might expect lay in the larger and warmer heart of the multitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0206.mp3|as she lifted her eyes towards the balcony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0208.mp3|and trembled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0209.mp3|the voice which had called her attention was that of the reverend and famous john wilson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0210.mp3|the eldest clergyman of boston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0211.mp3|a great scholar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0212.mp3|like most of his contemporaries in the profession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0214.mp3|this last attribute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0216.mp3|had been less carefully developed than his intellectual gifts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0218.mp3|in truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0219.mp3|rather a matter of shame than self congratulation with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0220.mp3|there he stood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0221.mp3|with a border of grizzled locks beneath his skull cap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0222.mp3|while his grey eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0223.mp3|accustomed to the shaded light of his study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0224.mp3|were winking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0225.mp3|like those of hester's infant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0226.mp3|in the unadulterated sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0227.mp3|he looked like the darkly engraved portraits which we see prefixed to old volumes of sermons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0228.mp3|and had no more right than one of those portraits would have to step forth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0229.mp3|as he now did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0230.mp3|and meddle with a question of human guilt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0234.mp3|i have striven with my young brother here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0235.mp3|under whose preaching of the word you have been privileged to sit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0236.mp3|here mister wilson laid his hand on the shoulder of a pale young man beside him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0238.mp3|i say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0239.mp3|to persuade this godly youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0240.mp3|that he should deal with you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0241.mp3|here in the face of heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0242.mp3|and before these wise and upright rulers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0243.mp3|and in hearing of all the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0244.mp3|as touching the vileness and blackness of your sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0245.mp3|knowing your natural temper better than i|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0246.mp3|he could the better judge what arguments to use|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0247.mp3|whether of tenderness or terror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0248.mp3|such as might prevail over your hardness and obstinacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0249.mp3|insomuch that you should no longer hide the name of him who tempted you to this grievous fall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0250.mp3|but he opposes to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0252.mp3|that it were wronging the very nature of woman to force her to lay open her heart's secrets in such broad daylight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0253.mp3|and in presence of so great a multitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0254.mp3|truly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0255.mp3|as i sought to convince him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0256.mp3|the shame lay in the commission of the sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0257.mp3|and not in the showing of it forth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0258.mp3|what say you to it once again brother dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0261.mp3|that shall deal with this poor sinner's soul there was a murmur among the dignified and reverend occupants of the balcony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0262.mp3|and governor bellingham gave expression to its purport|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0263.mp3|speaking in an authoritative voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0265.mp3|good master dimmesdale said he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0266.mp3|the responsibility of this woman's soul lies greatly with you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0270.mp3|as a proof and consequence thereof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0271.mp3|the directness of this appeal drew the eyes of the whole crowd upon the reverend mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0272.mp3|young clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0273.mp3|who had come from one of the great english universities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0274.mp3|bringing all the learning of the age into our wild forest land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0275.mp3|his eloquence and religious fervour had already given the earnest of high eminence in his profession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0276.mp3|he was a person of very striking aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0279.mp3|and impending brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0282.mp3|melancholy eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0283.mp3|and a mouth which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0284.mp3|unless when he forcibly compressed it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0285.mp3|was apt to be tremulous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0286.mp3|expressing both nervous sensibility and a vast power of self restraint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0287.mp3|notwithstanding his high native gifts and scholar like attainments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0288.mp3|there was an air about this young minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0289.mp3|an apprehensive a startled a half frightened look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0290.mp3|as of a being who felt himself quite astray|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0291.mp3|and at a loss in the pathway of human existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0292.mp3|and could only be at ease in some seclusion of his own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0294.mp3|so far as his duties would permit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0295.mp3|he trod in the shadowy by paths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0296.mp3|and thus kept himself simple and childlike|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0298.mp3|when occasion was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0299.mp3|with a freshness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0301.mp3|and dewy purity of thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0303.mp3|as many people said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0304.mp3|affected them like the speech of an angel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0305.mp3|such was the young man whom the reverend mister wilson and the governor had introduced so openly to the public notice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0306.mp3|bidding him speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0307.mp3|in the hearing of all men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0308.mp3|to that mystery of a woman's soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0309.mp3|so sacred even in its pollution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0310.mp3|the trying nature of his position drove the blood from his cheek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0311.mp3|and made his lips tremulous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0312.mp3|speak to the woman my brother said mister wilson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0314.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0315.mp3|therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0316.mp3|as the worshipful governor says|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0318.mp3|in whose charge hers is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0321.mp3|as it seemed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0322.mp3|and then came forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0323.mp3|hester prynne said he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0324.mp3|leaning over the balcony and looking down steadfastly into her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0325.mp3|thou hearest what this good man says|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0328.mp3|and that thy earthly punishment will thereby be made more effectual to salvation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0329.mp3|i charge thee to speak out the name of thy fellow sinner and fellow sufferer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0330.mp3|be not silent from any mistaken pity and tenderness for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0335.mp3|and stand there beside thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0336.mp3|on thy pedestal of shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0337.mp3|yet better were it so than to hide a guilty heart through life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0339.mp3|yea compel him as it were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0340.mp3|to add hypocrisy to sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0341.mp3|heaven hath granted thee an open ignominy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0342.mp3|that thereby thou mayest work out an open triumph over the evil within thee and the sorrow without|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0343.mp3|take heed how thou deniest to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0344.mp3|who perchance hath not the courage to grasp it for himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0350.mp3|and broken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0351.mp3|the feeling that it so evidently manifested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0352.mp3|rather than the direct purport of the words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0353.mp3|caused it to vibrate within all hearts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0354.mp3|and brought the listeners into one accord of sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0355.mp3|even the poor baby at hester's bosom was affected by the same influence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0356.mp3|for it directed its hitherto vacant gaze towards mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0358.mp3|half plaintive murmur|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0360.mp3|or else that the guilty one himself in whatever high or lowly place he stood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0361.mp3|would be drawn forth by an inward and inevitable necessity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0362.mp3|and compelled to ascend the scaffold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0363.mp3|hester shook her head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0366.mp3|more harshly than before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0367.mp3|that little babe hath been gifted with a voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0368.mp3|to second and confirm the counsel which thou hast heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0369.mp3|speak out the name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0375.mp3|not at mister wilson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0376.mp3|but into the deep and troubled eyes of the younger clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0377.mp3|it is too deeply branded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0379.mp3|and would that i might endure his agony as well as mine speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0380.mp3|woman said another voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0381.mp3|coldly and sternly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0382.mp3|proceeding from the crowd about the scaffold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0384.mp3|and give your child a father i will not speak answered hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0385.mp3|turning pale as death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0386.mp3|but responding to this voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0388.mp3|and my child must seek a heavenly father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0389.mp3|she shall never know an earthly one she will not speak murmured mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0391.mp3|leaning over the balcony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0392.mp3|with his hand upon his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0393.mp3|had awaited the result of his appeal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0394.mp3|he now drew back with a long respiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0395.mp3|wondrous strength and generosity of a woman's heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0396.mp3|she will not speak discerning the impracticable state of the poor culprit's mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0397.mp3|the elder clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0398.mp3|who had carefully prepared himself for the occasion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0399.mp3|addressed to the multitude a discourse on sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0400.mp3|in all its branches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0401.mp3|but with continual reference to the ignominious letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0402.mp3|so forcibly did he dwell upon this symbol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0403.mp3|for the hour or more during which his periods were rolling over the people's heads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0404.mp3|that it assumed new terrors in their imagination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0405.mp3|and seemed to derive its scarlet hue from the flames of the infernal pit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0408.mp3|kept her place upon the pedestal of shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0409.mp3|with glazed eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0410.mp3|and an air of weary indifference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0411.mp3|she had borne that morning all that nature could endure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0412.mp3|and as her temperament was not of the order that escapes from too intense suffering by a swoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0413.mp3|her spirit could only shelter itself beneath a stony crust of insensibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0414.mp3|while the faculties of animal life remained entire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0415.mp3|in this state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0416.mp3|the voice of the preacher thundered remorselessly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0418.mp3|upon her ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0421.mp3|pierced the air with its wailings and screams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0424.mp3|with the same hard demeanour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0425.mp3|she was led back to prison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_03_hawthorne_0426.mp3|and vanished from the public gaze within its iron clamped portal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0001.mp3|hester prynne was found to be in a state of nervous excitement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0002.mp3|that demanded constant watchfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0003.mp3|lest she should perpetrate violence on herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0004.mp3|or do some half frenzied mischief to the poor babe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0005.mp3|as night approached|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0006.mp3|it proving impossible to quell her insubordination by rebuke or threats of punishment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0010.mp3|he described him as a man of skill in all christian modes of physical science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0011.mp3|and likewise familiar with whatever the savage people could teach in respect to medicinal herbs and roots that grew in the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0013.mp3|there was much need of professional assistance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0014.mp3|not merely for hester herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0015.mp3|but still more urgently for the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0017.mp3|drawing its sustenance from the maternal bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0018.mp3|seemed to have drank in with it all the turmoil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0019.mp3|the anguish and despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0020.mp3|which pervaded the mother's system|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0021.mp3|it now writhed in convulsions of pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0022.mp3|and was a forcible type|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0025.mp3|closely following the jailer into the dismal apartment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0027.mp3|of singular aspect whose presence in the crowd had been of such deep interest to the wearer of the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0028.mp3|he was lodged in the prison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0029.mp3|not as suspected of any offence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0030.mp3|but as the most convenient and suitable mode of disposing of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0031.mp3|until the magistrates should have conferred with the indian sagamores respecting his ransom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0032.mp3|his name was announced as roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0033.mp3|the jailer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0034.mp3|after ushering him into the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0035.mp3|remained a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0036.mp3|marvelling at the comparative quiet that followed his entrance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0037.mp3|for hester prynne had immediately become as still as death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0038.mp3|although the child continued to moan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0041.mp3|leave me alone with my patient said the practitioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0042.mp3|trust me good jailer you shall briefly have peace in your house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0045.mp3|mistress prynne shall hereafter be more amenable to just authority than you may have found her heretofore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0047.mp3|if your worship can accomplish that answered master brackett|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0050.mp3|verily the woman hath been like a possessed one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0052.mp3|to drive satan out of her with stripes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0053.mp3|the stranger had entered the room with the characteristic quietude of the profession to which he announced himself as belonging|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0054.mp3|nor did his demeanour change when the withdrawal of the prison keeper left him face to face with the woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0055.mp3|whose absorbed notice of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0056.mp3|in the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0057.mp3|had intimated so close a relation between himself and her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0058.mp3|his first care was given to the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0061.mp3|as she lay writhing on the trundle bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0062.mp3|made it of peremptory necessity to postpone all other business to the task of soothing her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0063.mp3|he examined the infant carefully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0065.mp3|which he took from beneath his dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0066.mp3|it appeared to contain medical preparations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0067.mp3|one of which he mingled with a cup of water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0070.mp3|for above a year past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0071.mp3|among a people well versed in the kindly properties of simples|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0072.mp3|have made a better physician of me than many that claim the medical degree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0073.mp3|here woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0074.mp3|the child is yours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0075.mp3|she is none of mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0076.mp3|neither will she recognise my voice or aspect as a father's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0077.mp3|administer this draught therefore with thine own hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0079.mp3|at the same time gazing with strongly marked apprehension into his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0080.mp3|wouldst thou avenge thyself on the innocent babe whispered she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0081.mp3|foolish woman responded the physician half coldly half soothingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0082.mp3|what should ail me to harm this misbegotten and miserable babe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0083.mp3|the medicine is potent for good and were it my child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0084.mp3|yea mine own as well as thine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0085.mp3|i could do no better for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0086.mp3|as she still hesitated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0089.mp3|in no reasonable state of mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0090.mp3|he took the infant in his arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0091.mp3|and himself administered the draught|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0093.mp3|the moans of the little patient subsided|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0094.mp3|its convulsive tossings gradually ceased|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0095.mp3|and in a few moments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0096.mp3|as is the custom of young children after relief from pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0097.mp3|it sank into a profound and dewy slumber|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0098.mp3|the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0099.mp3|as he had a fair right to be termed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0100.mp3|next bestowed his attention on the mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0101.mp3|with calm and intent scrutiny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0102.mp3|he felt her pulse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0103.mp3|looked into her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0104.mp3|a gaze that made her heart shrink and shudder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0105.mp3|because so familiar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0106.mp3|and yet so strange and cold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0108.mp3|finally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0109.mp3|satisfied with his investigation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0110.mp3|proceeded to mingle another draught|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0112.mp3|but i have learned many new secrets in the wilderness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0113.mp3|and here is one of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0114.mp3|a recipe that an indian taught me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0115.mp3|in requital of some lessons of my own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0116.mp3|that were as old as paracelsus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0118.mp3|it may be less soothing than a sinless conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0119.mp3|that i cannot give thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0120.mp3|but it will calm the swell and heaving of thy passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0121.mp3|like oil thrown on the waves of a tempestuous sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0122.mp3|he presented the cup to hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0123.mp3|who received it with a slow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0125.mp3|not precisely a look of fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0126.mp3|yet full of doubt and questioning as to what his purposes might be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0127.mp3|she looked also at her slumbering child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0128.mp3|i have thought of death said she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0129.mp3|have wished for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0130.mp3|would even have prayed for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0131.mp3|were it fit that such as i should pray for anything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0134.mp3|i bid thee think again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0136.mp3|see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0137.mp3|it is even now at my lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0138.mp3|drink then replied he still with the same cold composure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0139.mp3|dost thou know me so little hester prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0141.mp3|even if i imagine a scheme of vengeance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0142.mp3|what could i do better for my object than to let thee live|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0143.mp3|than to give thee medicines against all harm and peril of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0144.mp3|so that this burning shame may still blaze upon thy bosom as he spoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0146.mp3|which forthwith seemed to scorch into hester's breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0147.mp3|as if it had been red hot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0148.mp3|he noticed her involuntary gesture and smiled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0151.mp3|and bear about thy doom with thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0152.mp3|in the eyes of men and women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0153.mp3|in the eyes of him whom thou didst call thy husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0155.mp3|and that thou mayest live take off this draught|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0157.mp3|hester prynne drained the cup|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0159.mp3|at the motion of the man of skill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0160.mp3|seated herself on the bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0161.mp3|where the child was sleeping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0162.mp3|while he drew the only chair which the room afforded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0163.mp3|and took his own seat beside her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0164.mp3|she could not but tremble at these preparations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0165.mp3|for she felt that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0170.mp3|a refined cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0171.mp3|impelled him to do for the relief of physical suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0172.mp3|he was next to treat with her as the man whom she had most deeply and irreparably injured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0173.mp3|hester said he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0175.mp3|nor how thou hast fallen into the pit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0178.mp3|thou hast ascended to the pedestal of infamy on which i found thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0179.mp3|the reason is not far to seek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0180.mp3|it was my folly and thy weakness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0183.mp3|a man already in decay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0184.mp3|having given my best years to feed the hungry dream of knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0185.mp3|what had i to do with youth and beauty like thine own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0186.mp3|misshapen from my birth hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0187.mp3|how could i delude myself with the idea that intellectual gifts might veil physical deformity in a young girl's fantasy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0188.mp3|men call me wise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0189.mp3|if sages were ever wise in their own behoof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0190.mp3|i might have foreseen all this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0191.mp3|i might have known that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0192.mp3|as i came out of the vast and dismal forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0193.mp3|and entered this settlement of christian men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0194.mp3|the very first object to meet my eyes would be thyself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0200.mp3|from the moment when we came down the old church steps together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0201.mp3|a married pair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0202.mp3|i might have beheld the bale fire of that scarlet letter blazing at the end of our path thou knowest said hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0204.mp3|depressed as she was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0205.mp3|she could not endure this last quiet stab at the token of her shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0206.mp3|thou knowest that i was frank with thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0207.mp3|i felt no love nor feigned any|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0208.mp3|true replied he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0209.mp3|it was my folly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0210.mp3|i have said it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0211.mp3|but up to that epoch of my life i had lived in vain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0212.mp3|the world had been so cheerless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0213.mp3|my heart was a habitation large enough for many guests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0214.mp3|but lonely and chill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0215.mp3|and without a household fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0216.mp3|i longed to kindle one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0217.mp3|it seemed not so wild a dream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0219.mp3|that the simple bliss|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0220.mp3|which is scattered far and wide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0221.mp3|for all mankind to gather up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0222.mp3|might yet be mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0223.mp3|and so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0225.mp3|i drew thee into my heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0226.mp3|into its innermost chamber|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0227.mp3|and sought to warm thee by the warmth which thy presence made there i have greatly wronged thee murmured hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0228.mp3|we have wronged each other answered he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0229.mp3|mine was the first wrong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0230.mp3|when i betrayed thy budding youth into a false and unnatural relation with my decay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0232.mp3|as a man who has not thought and philosophised in vain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0233.mp3|i seek no vengeance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0234.mp3|plot no evil against thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0235.mp3|between thee and me the scale hangs fairly balanced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0238.mp3|looking firmly into his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0239.mp3|that thou shalt never know never|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0240.mp3|sayest thou rejoined he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0241.mp3|with a smile of dark and self relying intelligence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0242.mp3|never know him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0245.mp3|there are few things whether in the outward world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0247.mp3|to a certain depth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0248.mp3|in the invisible sphere of thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0249.mp3|few things hidden from the man who devotes himself earnestly and unreservedly to the solution of a mystery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0250.mp3|thou mayest cover up thy secret from the prying multitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0253.mp3|from the ministers and magistrates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0254.mp3|even as thou didst this day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0255.mp3|when they sought to wrench the name out of thy heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0256.mp3|and give thee a partner on thy pedestal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0258.mp3|as for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0259.mp3|i come to the inquest with other senses than they possess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0260.mp3|i shall seek this man as i have sought truth in books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0261.mp3|as i have sought gold in alchemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0262.mp3|there is a sympathy that will make me conscious of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0263.mp3|i shall see him tremble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0264.mp3|i shall feel myself shudder suddenly and unawares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0265.mp3|sooner or later he must needs be mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0266.mp3|the eyes of the wrinkled scholar glowed so intensely upon her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0268.mp3|dreading lest he should read the secret there at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0269.mp3|thou wilt not reveal his name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0270.mp3|not the less he is mine resumed he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0271.mp3|with a look of confidence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0272.mp3|as if destiny were at one with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0273.mp3|he bears no letter of infamy wrought into his garment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0275.mp3|but i shall read it on his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0276.mp3|yet fear not for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0277.mp3|think not that i shall interfere with heaven's own method of retribution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0279.mp3|to my own loss|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0280.mp3|betray him to the gripe of human law|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0282.mp3|no nor against his fame if as i judge he be a man of fair repute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0283.mp3|let him live|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0284.mp3|let him hide himself in outward honour if he may|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0286.mp3|bewildered and appalled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0287.mp3|but thy words interpret thee as a terror one thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0288.mp3|thou that wast my wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0289.mp3|i would enjoin upon thee continued the scholar|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0293.mp3|breathe not to any human soul that thou didst ever call me husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0294.mp3|here on this wild outskirt of the earth i shall pitch my tent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0296.mp3|elsewhere a wanderer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0297.mp3|and isolated from human interests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0298.mp3|i find here a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0299.mp3|a man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0300.mp3|a child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0301.mp3|amongst whom and myself there exist the closest ligaments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0302.mp3|no matter whether of love or hate no matter whether of right or wrong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0303.mp3|thou and thine hester prynne belong to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0304.mp3|my home is where thou art and where he is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0305.mp3|but betray me not wherefore dost thou desire it inquired hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0307.mp3|she hardly knew why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0311.mp3|because i will not encounter the dishonour that besmirches the husband of a faithless woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0312.mp3|it may be for other reasons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0313.mp3|enough it is my purpose to live and die unknown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0317.mp3|and of whom no tidings shall ever come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0320.mp3|shouldst thou fail me in this beware|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0323.mp3|swear it rejoined he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0324.mp3|and she took the oath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0325.mp3|and now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0326.mp3|mistress prynne said old roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0327.mp3|as he was hereafter to be named|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0328.mp3|i leave thee alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0329.mp3|alone with thy infant and the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0330.mp3|how is it hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0331.mp3|doth thy sentence bind thee to wear the token in thy sleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0332.mp3|art thou not afraid of nightmares and hideous dreams why dost thou smile so at me inquired hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0333.mp3|troubled at the expression of his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0335.mp3|hast thou enticed me into a bond that will prove the ruin of my soul not thy soul he answered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_04_hawthorne_0336.mp3|with another smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0001.mp3|her prison door was thrown open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0002.mp3|and she came forth into the sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0003.mp3|which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0004.mp3|falling on all alike|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0006.mp3|to her sick and morbid heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0007.mp3|as if meant for no other purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter on her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0008.mp3|perhaps there was a more real torture in her first unattended footsteps from the threshold of the prison than even in the procession and spectacle that have been described|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0009.mp3|where she was made the common infamy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0010.mp3|at which all mankind was summoned to point its finger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0012.mp3|she was supported by an unnatural tension of the nerves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0013.mp3|and by all the combative energy of her character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0014.mp3|which enabled her to convert the scene into a kind of lurid triumph|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0017.mp3|a separate and insulated event|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0018.mp3|to occur but once in her lifetime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0019.mp3|and to meet which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0021.mp3|reckless of economy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0022.mp3|she might call up the vital strength that would have sufficed for many quiet years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0023.mp3|the very law that condemned her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0024.mp3|a giant of stern features but with vigour to support|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0026.mp3|in his iron arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0027.mp3|had held her up through the terrible ordeal of her ignominy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0028.mp3|but now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0029.mp3|with this unattended walk from her prison door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0030.mp3|began the daily custom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0031.mp3|and she must either sustain and carry it forward by the ordinary resources of her nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0032.mp3|or sink beneath it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0033.mp3|she could no longer borrow from the future to help her through the present grief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0036.mp3|each its own trial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0037.mp3|and yet the very same that was now so unutterably grievous to be borne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0039.mp3|still with the same burden for her to take up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0040.mp3|and bear along with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0041.mp3|but never to fling down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0042.mp3|for the accumulating days and added years would pile up their misery upon the heap of shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0043.mp3|throughout them all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0044.mp3|giving up her individuality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0045.mp3|she would become the general symbol at which the preacher and moralist might point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0046.mp3|and in which they might vivify and embody their images of woman's frailty and sinful passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0047.mp3|thus the young and pure would be taught to look at her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0048.mp3|with the scarlet letter flaming on her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0050.mp3|at her the mother of a babe that would hereafter be a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0052.mp3|as the figure the body the reality of sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0053.mp3|and over her grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0054.mp3|the infamy that she must carry thither would be her only monument|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0055.mp3|it may seem marvellous that with the world before her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0056.mp3|kept by no restrictive clause of her condemnation within the limits of the puritan settlement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0057.mp3|so remote and so obscure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0059.mp3|or to any other european land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0060.mp3|and there hide her character and identity under a new exterior|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0061.mp3|as completely as if emerging into another state of being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0062.mp3|and having also the passes of the dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0063.mp3|inscrutable forest open to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0064.mp3|where the wildness of her nature might assimilate itself with a people whose customs and life were alien from the law that had condemned her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0065.mp3|it may seem marvellous that this woman should still call that place her home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0067.mp3|and where only|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0068.mp3|she must needs be the type of shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0069.mp3|but there is a fatality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0070.mp3|a feeling so irresistible and inevitable that it has the force of doom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0071.mp3|which almost invariably compels human beings to linger around and haunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0074.mp3|and still the more irresistibly the darker the tinge that saddens it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0077.mp3|were the roots which she had struck into the soil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0078.mp3|it was as if a new birth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0079.mp3|with stronger assimilations than the first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0080.mp3|had converted the forest land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0081.mp3|still so uncongenial to every other pilgrim and wanderer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0083.mp3|but life long home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0084.mp3|all other scenes of earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0085.mp3|even that village of rural england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0086.mp3|where happy infancy and stainless maidenhood seemed yet to be in her mother's keeping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0087.mp3|like garments put off long ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0088.mp3|were foreign to her in comparison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0090.mp3|and galling to her inmost soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0091.mp3|but could never be broken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0092.mp3|it might be too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0093.mp3|doubtless it was so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0094.mp3|although she hid the secret from herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0095.mp3|and grew pale whenever it struggled out of her heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0096.mp3|like a serpent from its hole|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0097.mp3|it might be that another feeling kept her within the scene and pathway that had been so fatal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0102.mp3|would bring them together before the bar of final judgment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0103.mp3|and make that their marriage altar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0104.mp3|for a joint futurity of endless retribution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0106.mp3|the tempter of souls had thrust this idea upon hester's contemplation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0107.mp3|and laughed at the passionate and desperate joy with which she seized|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0108.mp3|and then strove to cast it from her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0109.mp3|she barely looked the idea in the face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0110.mp3|and hastened to bar it in its dungeon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0111.mp3|what she compelled herself to believe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0114.mp3|she reasoned upon as her motive for continuing a resident of new england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0115.mp3|was half a truth and half a self delusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0117.mp3|she said to herself had been the scene of her guilt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0118.mp3|and here should be the scene of her earthly punishment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0119.mp3|and so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0121.mp3|the torture of her daily shame would at length purge her soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0122.mp3|and work out another purity than that which she had lost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0123.mp3|more saint like because the result of martyrdom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0124.mp3|hester prynne therefore did not flee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0125.mp3|on the outskirts of the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0126.mp3|within the verge of the peninsula|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0127.mp3|but not in close vicinity to any other habitation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0128.mp3|there was a small thatched cottage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0129.mp3|it had been built by an earlier settler|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0131.mp3|because the soil about it was too sterile for cultivation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0132.mp3|while its comparative remoteness put it out of the sphere of that social activity which already marked the habits of the emigrants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0133.mp3|it stood on the shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0134.mp3|looking across a basin of the sea at the forest covered hills|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0135.mp3|towards the west|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0136.mp3|a clump of scrubby trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0137.mp3|such as alone grew on the peninsula|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0138.mp3|did not so much conceal the cottage from view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0140.mp3|or at least ought to be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0142.mp3|in this little lonesome dwelling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0143.mp3|with some slender means that she possessed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0145.mp3|who still kept an inquisitorial watch over her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0146.mp3|hester established herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0147.mp3|with her infant child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0148.mp3|a mystic shadow of suspicion immediately attached itself to the spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0150.mp3|too young to comprehend wherefore this woman should be shut out from the sphere of human charities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0151.mp3|would creep nigh enough to behold her plying her needle at the cottage window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0152.mp3|or standing in the doorway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0153.mp3|or labouring in her little garden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0155.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0156.mp3|discerning the scarlet letter on her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0157.mp3|would scamper off with a strange contagious fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0158.mp3|lonely as was hester's situation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0159.mp3|and without a friend on earth who dared to show himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0162.mp3|incurred no risk of want|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0163.mp3|she possessed an art that sufficed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0164.mp3|even in a land that afforded comparatively little scope for its exercise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0165.mp3|to supply food for her thriving infant and herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0166.mp3|it was the art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0168.mp3|as now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0169.mp3|almost the only one within a woman's grasp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0171.mp3|she bore on her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0172.mp3|in the curiously embroidered letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0173.mp3|a specimen of her delicate and imaginative skill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0174.mp3|of which the dames of a court might gladly have availed themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0175.mp3|to add the richer and more spiritual adornment of human ingenuity to their fabrics of silk and gold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0179.mp3|there might be an infrequent call for the finer productions of her handiwork|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0180.mp3|yet the taste of the age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0181.mp3|demanding whatever was elaborate in compositions of this kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0182.mp3|did not fail to extend its influence over our stern progenitors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0183.mp3|who had cast behind them so many fashions which it might seem harder to dispense with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0184.mp3|public ceremonies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0185.mp3|such as ordinations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0186.mp3|the installation of magistrates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0187.mp3|and all that could give majesty to the forms in which a new government manifested itself to the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0189.mp3|as a matter of policy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0190.mp3|marked by a stately and well conducted ceremonial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0192.mp3|but yet a studied magnificence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0194.mp3|painfully wrought bands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0195.mp3|and gorgeously embroidered gloves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0197.mp3|and were readily allowed to individuals dignified by rank or wealth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0198.mp3|even while sumptuary laws forbade these and similar extravagances to the plebeian order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0199.mp3|in the array of funerals too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0200.mp3|whether for the apparel of the dead body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0201.mp3|or to typify|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0202.mp3|by manifold emblematic devices of sable cloth and snowy lawn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0203.mp3|the sorrow of the survivors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0205.mp3|baby linen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0206.mp3|for babies then wore robes of state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0207.mp3|afforded still another possibility of toil and emolument|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0210.mp3|her handiwork became what would now be termed the fashion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0211.mp3|whether from commiseration for a woman of so miserable a destiny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0213.mp3|or by whatever other intangible circumstance was then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0216.mp3|on some persons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0217.mp3|what others might seek in vain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0218.mp3|or because hester really filled a gap which must otherwise have remained vacant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0219.mp3|it is certain that she had ready and fairly requited employment for as many hours as she saw fit to occupy with her needle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0222.mp3|chose to mortify itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0223.mp3|by putting on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0224.mp3|for ceremonials of pomp and state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0225.mp3|the garments that had been wrought by her sinful hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0229.mp3|it was shut up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0230.mp3|to be mildewed and moulder away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0231.mp3|in the coffins of the dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0232.mp3|but it is not recorded that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0233.mp3|in a single instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0234.mp3|her skill was called in to embroider the white veil which was to cover the pure blushes of a bride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0236.mp3|hester sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0237.mp3|of the plainest and most ascetic description|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0238.mp3|for herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0240.mp3|her own dress was of the coarsest materials and the most sombre hue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0241.mp3|with only that one ornament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0242.mp3|the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0243.mp3|which it was her doom to wear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0244.mp3|the child's attire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0245.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0246.mp3|was distinguished by a fanciful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0249.mp3|a fantastic ingenuity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0252.mp3|to heighten the airy charm that early began to develop itself in the little girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0253.mp3|but which appeared to have also a deeper meaning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0254.mp3|we may speak further of it hereafter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0255.mp3|except for that small expenditure in the decoration of her infant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0256.mp3|hester bestowed all her superfluous means in charity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0257.mp3|on wretches less miserable than herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0258.mp3|and who not unfrequently insulted the hand that fed them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0259.mp3|much of the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0260.mp3|which she might readily have applied to the better efforts of her art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0261.mp3|she employed in making coarse garments for the poor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0262.mp3|it is probable that there was an idea of penance in this mode of occupation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0263.mp3|and that she offered up a real sacrifice of enjoyment in devoting so many hours to such rude handiwork|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0264.mp3|she had in her nature a rich voluptuous oriental characteristic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0265.mp3|a taste for the gorgeously beautiful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0267.mp3|save in the exquisite productions of her needle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0268.mp3|found nothing else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0269.mp3|in all the possibilities of her life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0270.mp3|to exercise itself upon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0271.mp3|women derive a pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0272.mp3|incomprehensible to the other sex|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0273.mp3|from the delicate toil of the needle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0275.mp3|and therefore soothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0276.mp3|the passion of her life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0277.mp3|like all other joys she rejected it as sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0279.mp3|it is to be feared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0280.mp3|no genuine and steadfast penitence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0281.mp3|but something doubtful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0282.mp3|something that might be deeply wrong beneath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0283.mp3|in this manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0284.mp3|hester prynne came to have a part to perform in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0285.mp3|with her native energy of character and rare capacity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0286.mp3|it could not entirely cast her off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0287.mp3|although it had set a mark upon her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0289.mp3|in all her intercourse with society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0291.mp3|there was nothing that made her feel as if she belonged to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0292.mp3|every gesture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0293.mp3|every word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0294.mp3|and even the silence of those with whom she came in contact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0296.mp3|and often expressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0297.mp3|that she was banished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0298.mp3|and as much alone as if she inhabited another sphere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0299.mp3|or communicated with the common nature by other organs and senses than the rest of human kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0301.mp3|yet close beside them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0302.mp3|like a ghost that revisits the familiar fireside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0303.mp3|and can no longer make itself seen or felt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0304.mp3|no more smile with the household joy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0305.mp3|nor mourn with the kindred sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0307.mp3|should it succeed in manifesting its forbidden sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0311.mp3|and its bitterest scorn besides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0312.mp3|seemed to be the sole portion that she retained in the universal heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0313.mp3|it was not an age of delicacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0314.mp3|and her position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0315.mp3|although she understood it well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0316.mp3|and was in little danger of forgetting it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0317.mp3|was often brought before her vivid self perception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0318.mp3|like a new anguish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0319.mp3|by the rudest touch upon the tenderest spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0321.mp3|as we have already said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0322.mp3|whom she sought out to be the objects of her bounty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0323.mp3|often reviled the hand that was stretched forth to succour them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0324.mp3|dames of elevated rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0325.mp3|likewise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0326.mp3|whose doors she entered in the way of her occupation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0327.mp3|were accustomed to distil drops of bitterness into her heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0330.mp3|and sometimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0332.mp3|by a coarser expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0333.mp3|that fell upon the sufferer's defenceless breast like a rough blow upon an ulcerated wound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0334.mp3|hester had schooled herself long and well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0336.mp3|save by a flush of crimson that rose irrepressibly over her pale cheek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0337.mp3|and again subsided into the depths of her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0338.mp3|she was patient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0339.mp3|a martyr indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0340.mp3|but she forebore to pray for enemies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0342.mp3|in spite of her forgiving aspirations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0343.mp3|the words of the blessing should stubbornly twist themselves into a curse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0344.mp3|continually|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0345.mp3|and in a thousand other ways|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0346.mp3|did she feel the innumerable throbs of anguish that had been so cunningly contrived for her by the undying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0347.mp3|the ever active sentence of the puritan tribunal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0350.mp3|that brought a crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0351.mp3|with its mingled grin and frown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0353.mp3|sinful woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0354.mp3|if she entered a church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0355.mp3|trusting to share the sabbath smile of the universal father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0356.mp3|it was often her mishap to find herself the text of the discourse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0357.mp3|she grew to have a dread of children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0358.mp3|for they had imbibed from their parents a vague idea of something horrible in this dreary woman gliding silently through the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0359.mp3|with never any companion but one only child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0361.mp3|first allowing her to pass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0362.mp3|they pursued her at a distance with shrill cries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0364.mp3|but was none the less terrible to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0365.mp3|as proceeding from lips that babbled it unconsciously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0366.mp3|it seemed to argue so wide a diffusion of her shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0367.mp3|that all nature knew of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0368.mp3|it could have caused her no deeper pang had the leaves of the trees whispered the dark story among themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0369.mp3|had the summer breeze murmured about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0371.mp3|another peculiar torture was felt in the gaze of a new eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0372.mp3|when strangers looked curiously at the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0373.mp3|and none ever failed to do so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0377.mp3|she could scarcely refrain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0378.mp3|yet always did refrain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0379.mp3|from covering the symbol with her hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0383.mp3|its cool stare of familiarity was intolerable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0384.mp3|from first to last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0385.mp3|in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0387.mp3|the spot never grew callous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0388.mp3|it seemed on the contrary to grow more sensitive with daily torture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0389.mp3|but sometimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0390.mp3|once in many days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0391.mp3|or perchance in many months|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0392.mp3|she felt an eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0393.mp3|a human eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0394.mp3|upon the ignominious brand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0395.mp3|that seemed to give a momentary relief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0396.mp3|as if half of her agony were shared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0397.mp3|the next instant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0398.mp3|back it all rushed again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0399.mp3|with still a deeper throb of pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0400.mp3|for in that brief interval she had sinned anew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0401.mp3|had hester sinned alone her imagination was somewhat affected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0402.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0403.mp3|had she been of a softer moral and intellectual fibre would have been still more so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0404.mp3|by the strange and solitary anguish of her life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0405.mp3|walking to and fro|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0406.mp3|with those lonely footsteps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0407.mp3|in the little world with which she was outwardly connected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0408.mp3|it now and then appeared to hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0409.mp3|if altogether fancy it was nevertheless too potent to be resisted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0410.mp3|she felt or fancied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0412.mp3|that the scarlet letter had endowed her with a new sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0413.mp3|she shuddered to believe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0414.mp3|yet could not help believing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0415.mp3|that it gave her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0416.mp3|she was terror stricken by the revelations that were thus made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0417.mp3|what were they|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0418.mp3|could they be other than the insidious whispers of the bad angel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0419.mp3|who would fain have persuaded the struggling woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0420.mp3|as yet only half his victim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0421.mp3|that the outward guise of purity was but a lie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0422.mp3|and that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0423.mp3|if truth were everywhere to be shown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0425.mp3|or must she receive those intimations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0426.mp3|so obscure yet so distinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0427.mp3|as truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0428.mp3|in all her miserable experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0429.mp3|there was nothing else so awful and so loathsome as this sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0431.mp3|as well as shocked her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0432.mp3|by the irreverent inopportuneness of the occasions that brought it into vivid action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0433.mp3|sometimes the red infamy upon her breast would give a sympathetic throb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0434.mp3|as she passed near a venerable minister or magistrate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0435.mp3|the model of piety and justice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0436.mp3|to whom that age of antique reverence looked up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0437.mp3|as to a mortal man in fellowship with angels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0438.mp3|what evil thing is at hand would hester say to herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0439.mp3|lifting her reluctant eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0440.mp3|there would be nothing human within the scope of view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0441.mp3|save the form of this earthly saint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0443.mp3|as she met the sanctified frown of some matron|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0446.mp3|had kept cold snow within her bosom throughout life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0447.mp3|that unsunned snow in the matron's bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0449.mp3|what had the two in common|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0450.mp3|or once more the electric thrill would give her warning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0451.mp3|behold hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0454.mp3|she would detect the eyes of a young maiden glancing at the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0455.mp3|shyly and aside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0456.mp3|and quickly averted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0458.mp3|chill crimson in her cheeks as if her purity were somewhat sullied by that momentary glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0460.mp3|whose talisman was that fatal symbol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0461.mp3|wouldst thou leave nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0462.mp3|whether in youth or age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0463.mp3|for this poor sinner to revere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0464.mp3|such loss of faith is ever one of the saddest results of sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0465.mp3|be it accepted as a proof that all was not corrupt in this poor victim of her own frailty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0466.mp3|and man's hard law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0468.mp3|the vulgar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0470.mp3|in those dreary old times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0471.mp3|were always contributing a grotesque horror to what interested their imaginations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0472.mp3|had a story about the scarlet letter which we might readily work up into a terrific legend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0475.mp3|but was red hot with infernal fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0476.mp3|and could be seen glowing all alight whenever hester prynne walked abroad in the night time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_05_hawthorne_0477.mp3|and we must needs say it seared hester's bosom so deeply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0001.mp3|that little creature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0002.mp3|whose innocent life had sprung|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0003.mp3|by the inscrutable decree of providence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0004.mp3|a lovely and immortal flower|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0005.mp3|out of the rank luxuriance of a guilty passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0006.mp3|how strange it seemed to the sad woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0007.mp3|as she watched the growth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0008.mp3|and the beauty that became every day more brilliant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0009.mp3|and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0010.mp3|her pearl for so had hester called her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0011.mp3|not as a name expressive of her aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0014.mp3|unimpassioned lustre that would be indicated by the comparison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0015.mp3|but she named the infant pearl as being of great price|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0016.mp3|purchased with all she had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0019.mp3|man had marked this woman's sin by a scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0020.mp3|which had such potent and disastrous efficacy that no human sympathy could reach her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0022.mp3|god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0023.mp3|as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0024.mp3|had given her a lovely child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0027.mp3|and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0028.mp3|yet these thoughts affected hester prynne less with hope than apprehension|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0029.mp3|she knew that her deed had been evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0030.mp3|she could have no faith therefore that its result would be good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0031.mp3|day after day she looked fearfully into the child's expanding nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0032.mp3|ever dreading to detect some dark and wild peculiarity that should correspond with the guiltiness to which she owed her being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0033.mp3|certainly there was no physical defect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0034.mp3|by its perfect shape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0036.mp3|and its natural dexterity in the use of all its untried limbs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0037.mp3|the infant was worthy to have been brought forth in eden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0038.mp3|worthy to have been left there to be the plaything of the angels after the world's first parents were driven out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0039.mp3|the child had a native grace which does not invariably co exist with faultless beauty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0041.mp3|however simple|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0042.mp3|always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0045.mp3|with a morbid purpose that may be better understood hereafter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0046.mp3|had bought the richest tissues that could be procured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0047.mp3|and allowed her imaginative faculty its full play in the arrangement and decoration of the dresses which the child wore before the public eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0048.mp3|so magnificent was the small figure when thus arrayed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0049.mp3|and such was the splendour of pearl's own proper beauty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0050.mp3|shining through the gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a paler loveliness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0052.mp3|and yet a russet gown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0053.mp3|torn and soiled with the child's rude play|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0054.mp3|made a picture of her just as perfect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0055.mp3|pearl's aspect was imbued with a spell of infinite variety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0056.mp3|in this one child there were many children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0057.mp3|comprehending the full scope between the wild flower prettiness of a peasant baby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0060.mp3|of an infant princess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0062.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0063.mp3|there was a trait of passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0064.mp3|a certain depth of hue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0065.mp3|which she never lost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0066.mp3|and if in any of her changes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0067.mp3|she had grown fainter or paler|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0068.mp3|she would have ceased to be herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0069.mp3|it would have been no longer pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0070.mp3|this outward mutability indicated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0071.mp3|and did not more than fairly express|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0072.mp3|the various properties of her inner life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0074.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0075.mp3|or else hester's fears deceived her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0076.mp3|it lacked reference and adaptation to the world into which she was born|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0077.mp3|the child could not be made amenable to rules|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0078.mp3|in giving her existence a great law had been broken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0079.mp3|and the result was a being whose elements were perhaps beautiful and brilliant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0080.mp3|but all in disorder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0081.mp3|or with an order peculiar to themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0082.mp3|amidst which the point of variety and arrangement was difficult or impossible to be discovered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0084.mp3|and even then most vaguely and imperfectly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0086.mp3|and her bodily frame from its material of earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0087.mp3|the mother's impassioned state had been the medium through which were transmitted to the unborn infant the rays of its moral life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0089.mp3|however white and clear originally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0090.mp3|they had taken the deep stains of crimson and gold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0091.mp3|the fiery lustre|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0092.mp3|the black shadow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0093.mp3|and the untempered light of the intervening substance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0095.mp3|the warfare of hester's spirit at that epoch was perpetuated in pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0096.mp3|she could recognize her wild|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0098.mp3|defiant mood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0099.mp3|the flightiness of her temper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0100.mp3|and even some of the very cloud shapes of gloom and despondency that had brooded in her heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0101.mp3|they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0103.mp3|later in the day of earthly existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0105.mp3|the discipline of the family in those days was of a far more rigid kind than now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0106.mp3|the frown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0107.mp3|the harsh rebuke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0108.mp3|the frequent application of the rod|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0109.mp3|enjoined by scriptural authority|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0111.mp3|not merely in the way of punishment for actual offences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0112.mp3|but as a wholesome regimen for the growth and promotion of all childish virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0114.mp3|nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0115.mp3|the loving mother of this one child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0119.mp3|of her own errors and misfortunes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0120.mp3|she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0121.mp3|but the task was beyond her skill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0122.mp3|after testing both smiles and frowns|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0123.mp3|and proving that neither mode of treatment possessed any calculable influence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0124.mp3|hester was ultimately compelled to stand aside and permit the child to be swayed by her own impulses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0125.mp3|physical compulsion or restraint was effectual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0127.mp3|while it lasted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0128.mp3|as to any other kind of discipline|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0129.mp3|whether addressed to her mind or heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0130.mp3|little pearl might or might not be within its reach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0133.mp3|while pearl was yet an infant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0134.mp3|grew acquainted with a certain peculiar look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0135.mp3|that warned her when it would be labour thrown away to insist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0136.mp3|persuade or plead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0137.mp3|it was a look so intelligent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0138.mp3|yet inexplicable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0139.mp3|perverse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0140.mp3|sometimes so malicious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0141.mp3|but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0142.mp3|that hester could not help questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0143.mp3|she seemed rather an airy sprite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0145.mp3|after playing its fantastic sports for a little while upon the cottage floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0146.mp3|would flit away with a mocking smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0147.mp3|whenever that look appeared in her wild|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0149.mp3|deeply black eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0150.mp3|it invested her with a strange remoteness and intangibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0151.mp3|it was as if she were hovering in the air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0152.mp3|and might vanish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0153.mp3|like a glimmering light that comes we know not whence and goes we know not whither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0154.mp3|beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0155.mp3|to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0156.mp3|to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0157.mp3|not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0158.mp3|and not utterly delusive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0160.mp3|when she was caught|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0161.mp3|though full of merriment and music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0162.mp3|made her mother more doubtful than before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0163.mp3|heart smitten at this bewildering and baffling spell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0164.mp3|that so often came between herself and her sole treasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0165.mp3|whom she had bought so dear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0166.mp3|and who was all her world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0167.mp3|hester sometimes burst into passionate tears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0168.mp3|then perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0171.mp3|and clench her little fist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0174.mp3|not seldom she would laugh anew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0175.mp3|and louder than before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0176.mp3|like a thing incapable and unintelligent of human sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0178.mp3|but this more rarely happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0180.mp3|and seem intent on proving that she had a heart by breaking it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0181.mp3|yet hester was hardly safe in confiding herself to that gusty tenderness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0182.mp3|it passed as suddenly as it came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0183.mp3|brooding over all these matters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0184.mp3|the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0186.mp3|by some irregularity in the process of conjuration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0187.mp3|has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0188.mp3|her only real comfort was when the child lay in the placidity of sleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0189.mp3|then she was sure of her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0190.mp3|and tasted hours of quiet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0192.mp3|delicious happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0193.mp3|until|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0194.mp3|perhaps with that perverse expression glimmering from beneath her opening lids|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0195.mp3|little pearl awoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0197.mp3|with what strange rapidity indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0199.mp3|and then what a happiness would it have been could hester prynne have heard her clear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0202.mp3|amid all the entangled outcry of a group of sportive children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0203.mp3|but this could never be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0204.mp3|pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0205.mp3|an imp of evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0206.mp3|emblem and product of sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0207.mp3|she had no right among christened infants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0208.mp3|nothing was more remarkable than the instinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0209.mp3|as it seemed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0210.mp3|with which the child comprehended her loneliness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0211.mp3|the destiny that had drawn an inviolable circle round about her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0214.mp3|of her position in respect to other children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0215.mp3|never since her release from prison had hester met the public gaze without her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0216.mp3|in all her walks about the town pearl too was there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0217.mp3|first as the babe in arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0218.mp3|and afterwards as the little girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0219.mp3|small companion of her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0220.mp3|holding a forefinger with her whole grasp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0221.mp3|and tripping along at the rate of three or four footsteps to one of hester's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0222.mp3|she saw the children of the settlement on the grassy margin of the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0223.mp3|or at the domestic thresholds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0226.mp3|or taking scalps in a sham fight with the indians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0227.mp3|or scaring one another with freaks of imitative witchcraft|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0228.mp3|pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0229.mp3|if spoken to she would not speak again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0230.mp3|if the children gathered about her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0231.mp3|as they sometimes did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0232.mp3|pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0233.mp3|snatching up stones to fling at them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0235.mp3|incoherent exclamations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0236.mp3|that made her mother tremble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0238.mp3|the truth was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0241.mp3|had got a vague idea of something outlandish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0243.mp3|or at variance with ordinary fashions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0244.mp3|in the mother and child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0245.mp3|and therefore scorned them in their hearts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0246.mp3|and not unfrequently reviled them with their tongues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0247.mp3|pearl felt the sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0248.mp3|and requited it with the bitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a childish bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0249.mp3|these outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0251.mp3|because there was at least an intelligible earnestness in the mood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0252.mp3|instead of the fitful caprice that so often thwarted her in the child's manifestations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0255.mp3|to discern here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0256.mp3|again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0257.mp3|a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0258.mp3|all this enmity and passion had pearl inherited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0260.mp3|out of hester's heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0261.mp3|mother and daughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion from human society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0262.mp3|and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted hester prynne before pearl's birth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0263.mp3|but had since begun to be soothed away by the softening influences of maternity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0264.mp3|at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0265.mp3|within and around her mother's cottage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0266.mp3|pearl wanted not a wide and various circle of acquaintance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0267.mp3|the spell of life went forth from her ever creative spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0268.mp3|and communicated itself to a thousand objects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0269.mp3|as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0270.mp3|the unlikeliest materials|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0271.mp3|a stick a bunch of rags a flower|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0272.mp3|were the puppets of pearl's witchcraft|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0274.mp3|without undergoing any outward change|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0275.mp3|became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her inner world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0276.mp3|her one baby voice served a multitude of imaginary personages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0279.mp3|the pine trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0283.mp3|and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0284.mp3|needed little transformation to figure as puritan elders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0285.mp3|the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0287.mp3|it was wonderful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0290.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0291.mp3|but darting up and dancing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0292.mp3|always in a state of preternatural activity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0293.mp3|soon sinking down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0294.mp3|as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0295.mp3|and succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0296.mp3|it was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the northern lights|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0299.mp3|and the sportiveness of a growing mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0301.mp3|except as pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0302.mp3|in the dearth of human playmates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0303.mp3|was thrown more upon the visionary throng which she created|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0305.mp3|she never created a friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0308.mp3|against whom she rushed to battle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0309.mp3|it was inexpressibly sad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0310.mp3|then what depth of sorrow to a mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0311.mp3|who felt in her own heart the cause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0313.mp3|in one so young|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0314.mp3|this constant recognition of an adverse world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0315.mp3|and so fierce a training of the energies that were to make good her cause in the contest that must ensue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0316.mp3|gazing at pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0317.mp3|hester prynne often dropped her work upon her knees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0318.mp3|and cried out with an agony which she would fain have hidden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0319.mp3|but which made utterance for itself betwixt speech and a groan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0320.mp3|o father in heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0321.mp3|if thou art still my father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0322.mp3|what is this being which i have brought into the world and pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0323.mp3|overhearing the ejaculation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0325.mp3|of those throbs of anguish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0326.mp3|would turn her vivid and beautiful little face upon her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0327.mp3|smile with sprite like intelligence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0328.mp3|and resume her play|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0329.mp3|one peculiarity of the child's deportment remains yet to be told|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0330.mp3|the very first thing which she had noticed in her life was what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0331.mp3|not the mother's smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0334.mp3|by that faint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0335.mp3|embryo smile of the little mouth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0336.mp3|remembered so doubtfully afterwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0337.mp3|and with such fond discussion whether it were indeed a smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0338.mp3|by no means|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0340.mp3|shall we say it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0341.mp3|the scarlet letter on hester's bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0343.mp3|as her mother stooped over the cradle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0344.mp3|the infant's eyes had been caught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0345.mp3|and putting up her little hand she grasped at it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0346.mp3|smiling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0347.mp3|not doubtfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0348.mp3|but with a decided gleam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0349.mp3|that gave her face the look of a much older child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0351.mp3|gasping for breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0354.mp3|so infinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligent touch of pearl's baby hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0359.mp3|from that epoch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0360.mp3|except when the child was asleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0361.mp3|hester had never felt a moment's safety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0362.mp3|not a moment's calm enjoyment of her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0365.mp3|would sometimes elapse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0366.mp3|during which pearl's gaze might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0370.mp3|like the stroke of sudden death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0371.mp3|and always with that peculiar smile and odd expression of the eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0372.mp3|once this freakish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0373.mp3|elvish cast came into the child's eyes while hester was looking at her own image in them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0374.mp3|as mothers are fond of doing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0375.mp3|and suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0376.mp3|for women in solitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0379.mp3|she fancied that she beheld|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0380.mp3|not her own miniature portrait|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0381.mp3|but another face in the small black mirror of pearl's eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0384.mp3|full of smiling malice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0385.mp3|yet bearing the semblance of features that she had known full well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0386.mp3|though seldom with a smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0387.mp3|and never with malice in them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0388.mp3|it was as if an evil spirit possessed the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0389.mp3|and had just then peeped forth in mockery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0391.mp3|though less vividly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0392.mp3|by the same illusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0393.mp3|in the afternoon of a certain summer's day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0394.mp3|after pearl grew big enough to run about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0395.mp3|she amused herself with gathering handfuls of wild flowers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0396.mp3|and flinging them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0398.mp3|at her mother's bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0401.mp3|but whether from pride or resignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0402.mp3|or a feeling that her penance might best be wrought out by this unutterable pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0403.mp3|she resisted the impulse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0404.mp3|and sat erect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0406.mp3|looking sadly into little pearl's wild eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0407.mp3|still came the battery of flowers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0408.mp3|almost invariably hitting the mark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0409.mp3|and covering the mother's breast with hurts for which she could find no balm in this world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0410.mp3|nor knew how to seek it in another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0413.mp3|the child stood still and gazed at hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0414.mp3|with that little laughing image of a fiend peeping out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0415.mp3|or whether it peeped or no her mother so imagined it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0416.mp3|from the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0417.mp3|child what art thou cried the mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0418.mp3|oh i am your little pearl answered the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0419.mp3|but while she said it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0422.mp3|whose next freak might be to fly up the chimney|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0423.mp3|art thou my child in very truth asked hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0424.mp3|nor did she put the question altogether idly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0426.mp3|for the moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0427.mp3|with a portion of genuine earnestness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0429.mp3|such was pearl's wonderful intelligence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0430.mp3|that her mother half doubted whether she were not acquainted with the secret spell of her existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0431.mp3|and might not now reveal herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0433.mp3|thou art not my child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0435.mp3|for it was often the case that a sportive impulse came over her in the midst of her deepest suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0440.mp3|mother said the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0445.mp3|but she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acuteness of the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0446.mp3|whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0447.mp3|or because an evil spirit prompted her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0448.mp3|she put up her small forefinger and touched the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0449.mp3|he did not send me cried she positively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0451.mp3|thou must not talk so answered the mother suppressing a groan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0453.mp3|he sent even me thy mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0454.mp3|then much more thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0457.mp3|thou strange and elfish child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0458.mp3|whence didst thou come tell me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0460.mp3|no longer seriously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0462.mp3|it is thou that must tell me but hester could not resolve the query|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0463.mp3|being herself in a dismal labyrinth of doubt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0465.mp3|betwixt a smile and a shudder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0466.mp3|the talk of the neighbouring townspeople|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0468.mp3|seeking vainly elsewhere for the child's paternity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0469.mp3|and observing some of her odd attributes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0470.mp3|had given out that poor little pearl was a demon offspring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0472.mp3|ever since old catholic times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0473.mp3|had occasionally been seen on earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0474.mp3|through the agency of their mother's sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0475.mp3|and to promote some foul and wicked purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0477.mp3|according to the scandal of his monkish enemies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0478.mp3|was a brat of that hellish breed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_06_hawthorne_0479.mp3|nor was pearl the only child to whom this inauspicious origin was assigned among the new england puritans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0001.mp3|with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0002.mp3|and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0004.mp3|though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0005.mp3|he still held an honourable and influential place among the colonial magistracy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0006.mp3|another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0007.mp3|impelled hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0008.mp3|at this time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0009.mp3|to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0010.mp3|it had reached her ears that there was a design on the part of some of the leading inhabitants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0011.mp3|cherishing the more rigid order of principles in religion and government|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0012.mp3|to deprive her of her child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0013.mp3|on the supposition that pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0014.mp3|as already hinted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0015.mp3|was of demon origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0019.mp3|were really capable of moral and religious growth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0020.mp3|and possessed the elements of ultimate salvation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0021.mp3|then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0024.mp3|among those who promoted the design|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0025.mp3|governor bellingham was said to be one of the most busy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0026.mp3|it may appear singular|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0029.mp3|not a little ludicrous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0030.mp3|that an affair of this kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0031.mp3|which in later days would have been referred to no higher jurisdiction than that of the select men of the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0032.mp3|should then have been a question publicly discussed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0033.mp3|and on which statesmen of eminence took sides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0036.mp3|matters of even slighter public interest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0039.mp3|the period was hardly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0041.mp3|earlier than that of our story|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0042.mp3|when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0043.mp3|but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0044.mp3|full of concern therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0046.mp3|and a lonely woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0047.mp3|backed by the sympathies of nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0048.mp3|on the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0051.mp3|she was now of an age to run lightly along by her mother's side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0053.mp3|constantly in motion from morn till sunset|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0054.mp3|could have accomplished a much longer journey than that before her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0056.mp3|nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0057.mp3|more from caprice than necessity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0058.mp3|she demanded to be taken up in arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0060.mp3|and frisked onward before hester on the grassy pathway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0061.mp3|with many a harmless trip and tumble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0063.mp3|a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0064.mp3|a bright complexion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0065.mp3|eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0066.mp3|and hair already of a deep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0068.mp3|and which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0069.mp3|in after years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0070.mp3|would be nearly akin to black|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0071.mp3|there was fire in her and throughout her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0072.mp3|she seemed the unpremeditated offshoot of a passionate moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0073.mp3|her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0074.mp3|in contriving the child's garb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0075.mp3|had allowed the gorgeous tendencies of her imagination their full play|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0076.mp3|arraying her in a crimson velvet tunic of a peculiar cut|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0078.mp3|so much strength of colouring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0079.mp3|which must have given a wan and pallid aspect to cheeks of a fainter bloom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0080.mp3|was admirably adapted to pearl's beauty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0081.mp3|and made her the very brightest little jet of flame that ever danced upon the earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0082.mp3|but it was a remarkable attribute of this garb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0085.mp3|that it irresistibly and inevitably reminded the beholder of the token which hester prynne was doomed to wear upon her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0086.mp3|it was the scarlet letter in another form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0087.mp3|the scarlet letter endowed with life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0088.mp3|the mother herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0090.mp3|had carefully wrought out the similitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0091.mp3|lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0093.mp3|and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0094.mp3|as the two wayfarers came within the precincts of the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0095.mp3|the children of the puritans looked up from their play|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0096.mp3|or what passed for play with those sombre little urchins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0098.mp3|behold verily there is the woman of the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0101.mp3|there is the likeness of the scarlet letter running along by her side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0105.mp3|who was a dauntless child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0106.mp3|after frowning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0107.mp3|stamping her foot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0108.mp3|and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0109.mp3|suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0110.mp3|and put them all to flight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0111.mp3|she resembled in her fierce pursuit of them an infant pestilence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0112.mp3|the scarlet fever or some such half fledged angel of judgment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0113.mp3|whose mission was to punish the sins of the rising generation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0114.mp3|she screamed and shouted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0116.mp3|with a terrific volume of sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0119.mp3|caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0120.mp3|the victory accomplished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0121.mp3|pearl returned quietly to her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0125.mp3|without further adventure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0126.mp3|they reached the dwelling of governor bellingham|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0127.mp3|this was a large wooden house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0130.mp3|and melancholy at heart with the many sorrowful or joyful occurrences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0131.mp3|remembered or forgotten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0132.mp3|that have happened and passed away within their dusky chambers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0135.mp3|there was the freshness of the passing year on its exterior|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0136.mp3|and the cheerfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0137.mp3|gleaming forth from the sunny windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0138.mp3|of a human habitation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0139.mp3|into which death had never entered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0144.mp3|in which fragments of broken glass were plentifully intermixed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0147.mp3|it glittered and sparkled as if diamonds had been flung against it by the double handful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0149.mp3|it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0152.mp3|and had now grown hard and durable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0153.mp3|for the admiration of after times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0155.mp3|looking at this bright wonder of a house began to caper and dance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0157.mp3|and given her to play with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0159.mp3|thou must gather thine own sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0160.mp3|i have none to give thee they approached the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0162.mp3|and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0163.mp3|in both of which were lattice windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0165.mp3|lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0169.mp3|during that term he was to be the property of his master|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0170.mp3|and as much a commodity of bargain and sale as an ox|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0173.mp3|and long before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0174.mp3|in the old hereditary halls of england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0175.mp3|is the worshipful governor bellingham within inquired hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0178.mp3|staring with wide open eyes at the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0181.mp3|he had never before seen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0182.mp3|yea his honourable worship is within|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0184.mp3|ye may not see his worship now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0186.mp3|and the bond servant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0187.mp3|perhaps judging from the decision of her air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0188.mp3|and the glittering symbol in her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0189.mp3|that she was a great lady in the land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0190.mp3|offered no opposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0191.mp3|so the mother and little pearl were admitted into the hall of entrance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0192.mp3|with many variations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0193.mp3|suggested by the nature of his building materials|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0194.mp3|diversity of climate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0195.mp3|and a different mode of social life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0196.mp3|governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0199.mp3|was a wide and reasonably lofty hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0200.mp3|extending through the whole depth of the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0201.mp3|and forming a medium of general communication|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0202.mp3|more or less directly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0203.mp3|with all the other apartments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0204.mp3|at one extremity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0205.mp3|this spacious room was lighted by the windows of the two towers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0206.mp3|which formed a small recess on either side of the portal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0207.mp3|at the other end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0208.mp3|though partly muffled by a curtain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0209.mp3|it was more powerfully illuminated by one of those embowed hall windows which we read of in old books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0210.mp3|and which was provided with a deep and cushioned seat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0214.mp3|probably of the chronicles of england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0215.mp3|or other such substantial literature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0217.mp3|in our own days|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0219.mp3|to be turned over by the casual guest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0220.mp3|the furniture of the hall consisted of some ponderous chairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0221.mp3|the backs of which were elaborately carved with wreaths of oaken flowers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0222.mp3|and likewise a table in the same taste|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0224.mp3|or perhaps earlier|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0227.mp3|on the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0228.mp3|in token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0229.mp3|stood a large pewter tankard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0230.mp3|at the bottom of which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0231.mp3|had hester or pearl peeped into it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0232.mp3|they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draught of ale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0233.mp3|on the wall hung a row of portraits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0234.mp3|representing the forefathers of the bellingham lineage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0235.mp3|some with armour on their breasts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0238.mp3|as if they were the ghosts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0239.mp3|rather than the pictures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0240.mp3|of departed worthies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0242.mp3|at about the centre of the oaken panels that lined the hall was suspended a suit of mail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0245.mp3|an ancestral relic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0246.mp3|but of the most modern date|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0247.mp3|for it had been manufactured by a skilful armourer in london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0248.mp3|the same year in which governor bellingham came over to new england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0249.mp3|there was a steel head piece|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0252.mp3|with a pair of gauntlets and a sword hanging beneath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0254.mp3|and especially the helmet and breastplate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0255.mp3|so highly burnished as to glow with white radiance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0257.mp3|this bright panoply was not meant for mere idle show|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0258.mp3|but had been worn by the governor on many a solemn muster and training field|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0264.mp3|and accustomed to speak of bacon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0265.mp3|coke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0268.mp3|as his professional associates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0269.mp3|the exigencies of this new country had transformed governor bellingham into a soldier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0270.mp3|as well as a statesman and ruler|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0273.mp3|spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0274.mp3|mother cried she i see you here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0276.mp3|look hester looked by way of humouring the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0277.mp3|and she saw that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0278.mp3|owing to the peculiar effect of this convex mirror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0279.mp3|the scarlet letter was represented in exaggerated and gigantic proportions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0280.mp3|so as to be greatly the most prominent feature of her appearance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0281.mp3|in truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0283.mp3|smiling at her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0284.mp3|with the elfish intelligence that was so familiar an expression on her small physiognomy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0286.mp3|with so much breadth and intensity of effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0288.mp3|but of an imp who was seeking to mould itself into pearl's shape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0291.mp3|drawing her away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0292.mp3|come and look into this fair garden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0293.mp3|it may be we shall see flowers there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0294.mp3|more beautiful ones than we find in the woods|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0295.mp3|pearl accordingly ran to the bow window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0297.mp3|and looked along the vista of a garden walk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0298.mp3|carpeted with closely shaven grass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0299.mp3|and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0300.mp3|but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0301.mp3|the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0303.mp3|and amid the close struggle for subsistence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0304.mp3|the native english taste for ornamental gardening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0306.mp3|and a pumpkin vine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0307.mp3|rooted at some distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0308.mp3|had run across the intervening space|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0310.mp3|as if to warn the governor that this great lump of vegetable gold was as rich an ornament as new england earth would offer him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0313.mp3|and a number of apple trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0314.mp3|probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mister blackstone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0315.mp3|the first settler of the peninsula|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0316.mp3|that half mythological personage who rides through our early annals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0319.mp3|seeing the rose bushes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0320.mp3|began to cry for a red rose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0321.mp3|and would not be pacified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0322.mp3|hush child hush said her mother earnestly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0323.mp3|do not cry dear little pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0324.mp3|i hear voices in the garden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0325.mp3|the governor is coming and gentlemen along with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0328.mp3|a number of persons were seen approaching towards the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0330.mp3|in utter scorn of her mother's attempt to quiet her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0332.mp3|and then became silent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_07_hawthorne_0333.mp3|not from any notion of obedience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0001.mp3|such as elderly gentlemen loved to endue themselves with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0002.mp3|in their domestic privacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0003.mp3|walked foremost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0004.mp3|and appeared to be showing off his estate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0005.mp3|and expatiating on his projected improvements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0006.mp3|the wide circumference of an elaborate ruff|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0007.mp3|beneath his grey beard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0008.mp3|in the antiquated fashion of king james's reign|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0009.mp3|caused his head to look not a little like that of john the baptist in a charger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0010.mp3|the impression made by his aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0012.mp3|and frost bitten with more than autumnal age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0013.mp3|was hardly in keeping with the appliances of worldly enjoyment wherewith he had evidently done his utmost to surround himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0015.mp3|though accustomed to speak and think of human existence as a state merely of trial and warfare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0018.mp3|or even luxury|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0019.mp3|as lay fairly within their grasp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0020.mp3|this creed was never taught|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0022.mp3|by the venerable pastor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0023.mp3|john wilson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0025.mp3|white as a snow drift|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0028.mp3|and that purple grapes might possibly be compelled to flourish against the sunny garden wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0029.mp3|the old clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0030.mp3|nurtured at the rich bosom of the english church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0031.mp3|had a long established and legitimate taste for all good and comfortable things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0032.mp3|and however stern he might show himself in the pulpit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0036.mp3|behind the governor and mister wilson came two other guests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0038.mp3|the reverend arthur dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0040.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0041.mp3|in close companionship with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0042.mp3|old roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0043.mp3|a person of great skill in physic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0044.mp3|who for two or three years past had been settled in the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0045.mp3|it was understood that this learned man was the physician as well as friend of the young minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0046.mp3|whose health had severely suffered of late by his too unreserved self sacrifice to the labours and duties of the pastoral relation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0047.mp3|the governor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0048.mp3|in advance of his visitors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0049.mp3|ascended one or two steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0051.mp3|throwing open the leaves of the great hall window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0052.mp3|found himself close to little pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0054.mp3|and partially concealed her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0055.mp3|what have we here said governor bellingham|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0056.mp3|looking with surprise at the scarlet little figure before him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0057.mp3|i profess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0058.mp3|i have never seen the like since my days of vanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0059.mp3|in old king james's time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0060.mp3|when i was wont to esteem it a high favour to be admitted to a court mask|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0062.mp3|and we called them children of the lord of misrule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0064.mp3|indeed cried good old mister wilson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0065.mp3|what little bird of scarlet plumage may this be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0066.mp3|methinks i have seen just such figures when the sun has been shining through a richly painted window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0067.mp3|and tracing out the golden and crimson images across the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0068.mp3|but that was in the old land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0075.mp3|or art thou one of those naughty elfs or fairies whom we thought to have left behind us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0076.mp3|with other relics of papistry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0077.mp3|in merry old england i am mother's child answered the scarlet vision|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0079.mp3|ruby rather or coral|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0082.mp3|judging from thy hue responded the old minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0083.mp3|putting forth his hand in a vain attempt to pat little pearl on the cheek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0084.mp3|but where is this mother of thine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0086.mp3|i see he added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0088.mp3|turning to governor bellingham|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0091.mp3|and behold here the unhappy woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0093.mp3|her mother sayest thou so cried the governor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0095.mp3|we might have judged that such a child's mother must needs be a scarlet woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0097.mp3|but she comes at a good time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0098.mp3|and we will look into this matter forthwith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0099.mp3|governor bellingham stepped through the window into the hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0100.mp3|followed by his three guests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0101.mp3|hester prynne said he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0102.mp3|fixing his naturally stern regard on the wearer of the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0103.mp3|there hath been much question concerning thee of late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0106.mp3|that are of authority and influence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0107.mp3|do well discharge our consciences by trusting an immortal soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0108.mp3|such as there is in yonder child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0109.mp3|to the guidance of one who hath stumbled and fallen amid the pitfalls of this world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0112.mp3|thinkest thou|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0114.mp3|and clad soberly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0115.mp3|and disciplined strictly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0116.mp3|and instructed in the truths of heaven and earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0118.mp3|laying her finger on the red token|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0119.mp3|woman it is thy badge of shame replied the stern magistrate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0120.mp3|it is because of the stain which that letter indicates that we would transfer thy child to other hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0123.mp3|though growing more pale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0124.mp3|this badge hath taught me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0125.mp3|it daily teaches me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0126.mp3|it is teaching me at this moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0127.mp3|lessons whereof my child may be the wiser and better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0128.mp3|albeit they can profit nothing to myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0129.mp3|we will judge warily said bellingham|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0130.mp3|and look well what we are about to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0131.mp3|good master wilson i pray you examine this pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0132.mp3|since that is her name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0133.mp3|and see whether she hath had such christian nurture as befits a child of her age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0135.mp3|but the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0136.mp3|unaccustomed to the touch or familiarity of any but her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0137.mp3|escaped through the open window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0138.mp3|and stood on the upper step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0139.mp3|looking like a wild tropical bird of rich plumage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0140.mp3|ready to take flight into the upper air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0141.mp3|mister wilson not a little astonished at this outbreak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0142.mp3|for he was a grandfatherly sort of personage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0144.mp3|essayed however to proceed with the examination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0145.mp3|pearl said he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0146.mp3|with great solemnity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0149.mp3|in due season|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0150.mp3|thou mayest wear in thy bosom the pearl of great price|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0151.mp3|canst thou tell me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0154.mp3|for hester prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0155.mp3|the daughter of a pious home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0156.mp3|very soon after her talk with the child about her heavenly father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0157.mp3|had begun to inform her of those truths which the human spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0158.mp3|at whatever stage of immaturity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0159.mp3|imbibes with such eager interest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0160.mp3|pearl therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0162.mp3|could have borne a fair examination in the new england primer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0163.mp3|or the first column of the westminster catechisms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0164.mp3|although unacquainted with the outward form of either of those celebrated works|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0166.mp3|which all children have more or less of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0167.mp3|and of which little pearl had a tenfold portion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0169.mp3|at the most inopportune moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0170.mp3|took thorough possession of her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0171.mp3|and closed her lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0172.mp3|or impelled her to speak words amiss|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0173.mp3|after putting her finger in her mouth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0174.mp3|with many ungracious refusals to answer good mister wilson's question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0175.mp3|the child finally announced that she had not been made at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0176.mp3|but had been plucked by her mother off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prison door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0179.mp3|together with her recollection of the prison rose bush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0180.mp3|which she had passed in coming hither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0182.mp3|with a smile on his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0183.mp3|whispered something in the young clergyman's ear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0185.mp3|and even then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0186.mp3|with her fate hanging in the balance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0187.mp3|was startled to perceive what a change had come over his features|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0188.mp3|how much uglier they were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0189.mp3|how his dark complexion seemed to have grown duskier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0190.mp3|and his figure more misshapen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0191.mp3|since the days when she had familiarly known him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0192.mp3|she met his eyes for an instant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0193.mp3|but was immediately constrained to give all her attention to the scene now going forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0194.mp3|this is awful cried the governor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0195.mp3|slowly recovering from the astonishment into which pearl's response had thrown him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0196.mp3|here is a child of three years old and she cannot tell who made her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0198.mp3|she is equally in the dark as to her soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0200.mp3|and future destiny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0201.mp3|methinks gentlemen we need inquire no further|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0202.mp3|hester caught hold of pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0203.mp3|and drew her forcibly into her arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0204.mp3|confronting the old puritan magistrate with almost a fierce expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0205.mp3|alone in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0206.mp3|cast off by it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0207.mp3|and with this sole treasure to keep her heart alive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0208.mp3|she felt that she possessed indefeasible rights against the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0209.mp3|and was ready to defend them to the death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0210.mp3|god gave me the child cried she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0212.mp3|she is my happiness she is my torture none the less|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0216.mp3|she is the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0217.mp3|only capable of being loved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0218.mp3|and so endowed with a millionfold the power of retribution for my sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0220.mp3|i will die first my poor woman said the not unkind old minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0221.mp3|the child shall be well cared for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0224.mp3|raising her voice almost to a shriek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0225.mp3|i will not give her up and here by a sudden impulse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0226.mp3|she turned to the young clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0227.mp3|mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0228.mp3|at whom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0229.mp3|up to this moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0230.mp3|she had seemed hardly so much as once to direct her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0231.mp3|speak thou for me cried she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0234.mp3|and knowest me better than these men can|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0235.mp3|i will not lose the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0236.mp3|speak for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0237.mp3|thou knowest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0238.mp3|for thou hast sympathies which these men lack|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0239.mp3|thou knowest what is in my heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0243.mp3|i will not lose the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0244.mp3|look to it at this wild and singular appeal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0246.mp3|the young minister at once came forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0248.mp3|and holding his hand over his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0251.mp3|and whether it were his failing health|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0252.mp3|or whatever the cause might be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0253.mp3|his large dark eyes had a world of pain in their troubled and melancholy depth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0254.mp3|there is truth in what she says began the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0255.mp3|with a voice sweet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0257.mp3|but powerful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0259.mp3|truth in what hester says and in the feeling which inspires her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0260.mp3|god gave her the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0263.mp3|an instinctive knowledge of its nature and requirements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0264.mp3|both seemingly so peculiar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0265.mp3|which no other mortal being can possess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0268.mp3|is there not a quality of awful sacredness in the relation between this mother and this child ay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0269.mp3|how is that good master dimmesdale interrupted the governor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0271.mp3|i pray you it must be even so resumed the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0273.mp3|if we deem it otherwise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0274.mp3|do we not thereby say that the heavenly father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0275.mp3|the creator of all flesh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0277.mp3|and made of no account the distinction between unhallowed lust and holy love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0279.mp3|to work in many ways upon her heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0280.mp3|who pleads so earnestly and with such bitterness of spirit the right to keep her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0281.mp3|it was meant for a blessing for the one blessing of her life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0285.mp3|for a retribution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0287.mp3|a torture to be felt at many an unthought of moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0288.mp3|a pang|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0290.mp3|an ever recurring agony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0291.mp3|in the midst of a troubled joy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0292.mp3|hath she not expressed this thought in the garb of the poor child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0293.mp3|so forcibly reminding us of that red symbol which sears her bosom well said again cried good mister wilson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0296.mp3|not so continued mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0298.mp3|believe me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0299.mp3|the solemn miracle which god hath wrought in the existence of that child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0300.mp3|and may she feel too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0301.mp3|what methinks is the very truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0302.mp3|that this boon was meant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0303.mp3|above all things else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0304.mp3|to keep the mother's soul alive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0305.mp3|and to preserve her from blacker depths of sin into which satan might else have sought to plunge her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0306.mp3|therefore it is good for this poor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0307.mp3|sinful woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0308.mp3|that she hath an infant immortality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0310.mp3|confided to her care|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0311.mp3|to be trained up by her to righteousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0313.mp3|at every moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0315.mp3|but yet to teach her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0318.mp3|if she bring the child to heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0320.mp3|herein is the sinful mother happier than the sinful father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0322.mp3|then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0323.mp3|and no less for the poor child's sake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0324.mp3|let us leave them as providence hath seen fit to place them you speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0327.mp3|smiling at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0329.mp3|mister wilson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0330.mp3|what say you worshipful master bellingham|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0333.mp3|that we will even leave the matter as it now stands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0334.mp3|so long at least as there shall be no further scandal in the woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0335.mp3|care must be had nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0341.mp3|the young minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0342.mp3|on ceasing to speak had withdrawn a few steps from the group|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0343.mp3|and stood with his face partially concealed in the heavy folds of the window curtain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0344.mp3|while the shadow of his figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0345.mp3|which the sunlight cast upon the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0346.mp3|was tremulous with the vehemence of his appeal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0348.mp3|that wild and flighty little elf stole softly towards him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0349.mp3|and taking his hand in the grasp of both her own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0350.mp3|laid her cheek against it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0351.mp3|a caress so tender|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0354.mp3|who was looking on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0355.mp3|asked herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0356.mp3|is that my pearl yet she knew that there was love in the child's heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0358.mp3|and hardly twice in her lifetime had been softened by such gentleness as now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0359.mp3|the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0361.mp3|save the long sought regards of woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0362.mp3|nothing is sweeter than these marks of childish preference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0363.mp3|accorded spontaneously by a spiritual instinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0364.mp3|and therefore seeming to imply in us something truly worthy to be loved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0365.mp3|the minister looked round|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0366.mp3|laid his hand on the child's head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0367.mp3|hesitated an instant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0368.mp3|and then kissed her brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0371.mp3|and went capering down the hall so airily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0372.mp3|that old mister wilson raised a question whether even her tiptoes touched the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0376.mp3|it is easy to see the mother's part in her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0377.mp3|would it be beyond a philosopher's research|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0386.mp3|to follow the clue of profane philosophy said mister wilson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0387.mp3|better to fast and pray upon it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0390.mp3|to leave the mystery as we find it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0391.mp3|unless providence reveal it of its own accord|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0394.mp3|deserted babe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0395.mp3|the affair being so satisfactorily concluded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0398.mp3|departed from the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0399.mp3|as they descended the steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0400.mp3|it is averred that the lattice of a chamber window was thrown open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0401.mp3|and forth into the sunny day was thrust the face of mistress hibbins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0402.mp3|governor bellingham's bitter tempered sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0403.mp3|and the same who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0404.mp3|a few years later|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0405.mp3|was executed as a witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0409.mp3|wilt thou go with us to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0410.mp3|there will be a merry company in the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0411.mp3|and i well nigh promised the black man that comely hester prynne should make one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0412.mp3|make my excuse to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0414.mp3|with a triumphant smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0415.mp3|i must tarry at home and keep watch over my little pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0416.mp3|had they taken her from me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0417.mp3|i would willingly have gone with thee into the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0418.mp3|and signed my name in the black man's book too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0421.mp3|as she drew back her head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0422.mp3|but here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0424.mp3|and not a parable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0425.mp3|was already an illustration of the young minister's argument against sundering the relation of a fallen mother to the offspring of her frailty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_08_hawthorne_0426.mp3|even thus early had the child saved her from satan's snare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0000.mp3|under the appellation of roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0001.mp3|the reader will remember|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0002.mp3|was hidden another name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0003.mp3|which its former wearer had resolved should never more be spoken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0004.mp3|it has been related|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0006.mp3|in the crowd that witnessed hester prynne's ignominious exposure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0007.mp3|stood a man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0011.mp3|just emerging from the perilous wilderness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0012.mp3|beheld the woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0013.mp3|in whom he hoped to find embodied the warmth and cheerfulness of home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0014.mp3|set up as a type of sin before the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0015.mp3|her matronly fame was trodden under all men's feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0016.mp3|infamy was babbling around her in the public market place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0017.mp3|for her kindred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0018.mp3|should the tidings ever reach them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0019.mp3|and for the companions of her unspotted life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0020.mp3|there remained nothing but the contagion of her dishonour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0021.mp3|which would not fail to be distributed in strict accordance and proportion with the intimacy and sacredness of their previous relationship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0022.mp3|then why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0023.mp3|since the choice was with himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0024.mp3|should the individual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0026.mp3|come forward to vindicate his claim to an inheritance so little desirable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0028.mp3|unknown to all but hester prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0029.mp3|and possessing the lock and key of her silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0031.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0033.mp3|to vanish out of life as completely as if he indeed lay at the bottom of the ocean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0036.mp3|new interests would immediately spring up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0037.mp3|and likewise a new purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0040.mp3|if not guilty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0041.mp3|but of force enough to engage the full strength of his faculties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0042.mp3|in pursuance of this resolve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0043.mp3|he took up his residence in the puritan town as roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0044.mp3|without other introduction than the learning and intelligence of which he possessed more than a common measure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0046.mp3|at a previous period of his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0047.mp3|had made him extensively acquainted with the medical science of the day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0048.mp3|it was as a physician that he presented himself and as such was cordially received|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0051.mp3|were of rare occurrence in the colony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0053.mp3|it would appear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0055.mp3|in their researches into the human frame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0057.mp3|and that they lost the spiritual view of existence amid the intricacies of that wondrous mechanism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0058.mp3|which seemed to involve art enough to comprise all of life within itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0059.mp3|at all events|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0060.mp3|the health of the good town of boston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0061.mp3|so far as medicine had aught to do with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0062.mp3|had hitherto lain in the guardianship of an aged deacon and apothecary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0064.mp3|the only surgeon was one who combined the occasional exercise of that noble art with the daily and habitual flourish of a razor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0065.mp3|to such a professional body roger chillingworth was a brilliant acquisition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0066.mp3|he soon manifested his familiarity with the ponderous and imposing machinery of antique physic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0067.mp3|in which every remedy contained a multitude of far fetched and heterogeneous ingredients|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0068.mp3|as elaborately compounded as if the proposed result had been the elixir of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0071.mp3|he had gained much knowledge of the properties of native herbs and roots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0075.mp3|which so many learned doctors had spent centuries in elaborating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0076.mp3|this learned stranger was exemplary as regarded at least the outward forms of a religious life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0077.mp3|and early after his arrival|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0078.mp3|had chosen for his spiritual guide the reverend mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0079.mp3|the young divine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0080.mp3|whose scholar like renown still lived in oxford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0083.mp3|should he live and labour for the ordinary term of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0085.mp3|for the now feeble new england church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0086.mp3|as the early fathers had achieved for the infancy of the christian faith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0087.mp3|about this period|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0089.mp3|the health of mister dimmesdale had evidently begun to fail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0090.mp3|by those best acquainted with his habits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0091.mp3|the paleness of the young minister's cheek was accounted for by his too earnest devotion to study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0092.mp3|his scrupulous fulfilment of parochial duty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0093.mp3|and more than all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0095.mp3|in order to keep the grossness of this earthly state from clogging and obscuring his spiritual lamp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0097.mp3|that if mister dimmesdale were really going to die|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0098.mp3|it was cause enough that the world was not worthy to be any longer trodden by his feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0101.mp3|with characteristic humility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0102.mp3|avowed his belief that if providence should see fit to remove him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0103.mp3|it would be because of his own unworthiness to perform its humblest mission here on earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0104.mp3|with all this difference of opinion as to the cause of his decline|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0105.mp3|there could be no question of the fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0106.mp3|his form grew emaciated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0108.mp3|though still rich and sweet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0109.mp3|had a certain melancholy prophecy of decay in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0110.mp3|he was often observed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0111.mp3|on any slight alarm or other sudden accident|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0112.mp3|to put his hand over his heart with first a flush and then a paleness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0113.mp3|indicative of pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0114.mp3|such was the young clergyman's condition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0115.mp3|and so imminent the prospect that his dawning light would be extinguished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0116.mp3|all untimely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0117.mp3|when roger chillingworth made his advent to the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0118.mp3|his first entry on the scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0119.mp3|few people could tell whence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0120.mp3|dropping down as it were out of the sky or starting from the nether earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0121.mp3|had an aspect of mystery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0123.mp3|he was now known to be a man of skill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0124.mp3|it was observed that he gathered herbs and the blossoms of wild flowers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0127.mp3|whose scientific attainments were esteemed hardly less than supernatural|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0128.mp3|as having been his correspondents or associates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0129.mp3|why with such rank in the learned world had he come hither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0132.mp3|whose sphere was in great cities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0134.mp3|in answer to this query a rumour gained ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0135.mp3|and however absurd was entertained by some very sensible people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0136.mp3|that heaven had wrought an absolute miracle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0137.mp3|by transporting an eminent doctor of physic from a german university bodily through the air and setting him down at the door of mister dimmesdale's study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0138.mp3|individuals of wiser faith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0140.mp3|who knew that heaven promotes its purposes without aiming at the stage effect of what is called miraculous interposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0142.mp3|this idea was countenanced by the strong interest which the physician ever manifested in the young clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0143.mp3|he attached himself to him as a parishioner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0144.mp3|and sought to win a friendly regard and confidence from his naturally reserved sensibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0145.mp3|he expressed great alarm at his pastor's state of health|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0146.mp3|but was anxious to attempt the cure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0148.mp3|if early undertaken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0150.mp3|the elders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0152.mp3|the motherly dames|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0153.mp3|and the young and fair maidens of mister dimmesdale's flock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0154.mp3|were alike importunate that he should make trial of the physician's frankly offered skill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0155.mp3|mister dimmesdale gently repelled their entreaties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0156.mp3|i need no medicine said he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0157.mp3|but how could the young minister say so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0158.mp3|when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0159.mp3|with every successive sabbath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0160.mp3|his cheek was paler and thinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0161.mp3|and his voice more tremulous than before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0162.mp3|when it had now become a constant habit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0163.mp3|rather than a casual gesture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0164.mp3|to press his hand over his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0166.mp3|did he wish to die|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0167.mp3|these questions were solemnly propounded to mister dimmesdale by the elder ministers of boston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0168.mp3|and the deacons of his church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0170.mp3|to use their own phrase|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0171.mp3|dealt with him on the sin of rejecting the aid which providence so manifestly held out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0172.mp3|he listened in silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0173.mp3|and finally promised to confer with the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0174.mp3|were it god's will said the reverend mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0175.mp3|when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0176.mp3|in fulfilment of this pledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0177.mp3|he requested old roger chillingworth's professional advice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0178.mp3|i could be well content that my labours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0179.mp3|and my sorrows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0180.mp3|and my sins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0181.mp3|and my pains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0182.mp3|should shortly end with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0183.mp3|and what is earthly of them be buried in my grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0185.mp3|rather than that you should put your skill to the proof in my behalf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0186.mp3|ah replied roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0187.mp3|with that quietness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0189.mp3|whether imposed or natural|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0190.mp3|marked all his deportment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0191.mp3|it is thus that a young clergyman is apt to speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0192.mp3|youthful men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0193.mp3|not having taken a deep root|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0194.mp3|give up their hold of life so easily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0195.mp3|and saintly men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0196.mp3|who walk with god on earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0197.mp3|would fain be away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0198.mp3|to walk with him on the golden pavements of the new jerusalem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0199.mp3|nay rejoined the young minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0200.mp3|putting his hand to his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0201.mp3|with a flush of pain flitting over his brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0203.mp3|i could be better content to toil here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0205.mp3|in this manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0206.mp3|the mysterious old roger chillingworth became the medical adviser of the reverend mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0207.mp3|as not only the disease interested the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0208.mp3|but he was strongly moved to look into the character and qualities of the patient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0209.mp3|these two men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0210.mp3|so different in age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0211.mp3|came gradually to spend much time together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0212.mp3|for the sake of the minister's health|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0213.mp3|and to enable the leech to gather plants with healing balm in them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0215.mp3|or in the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0217.mp3|and the solemn wind anthem among the tree tops|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0218.mp3|often|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0219.mp3|likewise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0220.mp3|one was the guest of the other in his place of study and retirement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0221.mp3|there was a fascination for the minister in the company of the man of science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0224.mp3|that he would have vainly looked for among the members of his own profession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0225.mp3|in truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0226.mp3|he was startled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0227.mp3|if not shocked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0228.mp3|to find this attribute in the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0229.mp3|mister dimmesdale was a true priest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0230.mp3|a true religionist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0231.mp3|with the reverential sentiment largely developed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0232.mp3|and an order of mind that impelled itself powerfully along the track of a creed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0233.mp3|and wore its passage continually deeper with the lapse of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0234.mp3|in no state of society would he have been what is called a man of liberal views|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0235.mp3|it would always be essential to his peace to feel the pressure of a faith about him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0237.mp3|while it confined him within its iron framework|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0241.mp3|did he feel the occasional relief of looking at the universe through the medium of another kind of intellect than those with which he habitually held converse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0242.mp3|it was as if a window were thrown open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0243.mp3|admitting a freer atmosphere into the close and stifled study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0244.mp3|where his life was wasting itself away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0246.mp3|or obstructed day beams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0247.mp3|and the musty fragrance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0248.mp3|be it sensual or moral|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0249.mp3|that exhales from books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0250.mp3|but the air was too fresh and chill to be long breathed with comfort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0251.mp3|so the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0252.mp3|and the physician with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0253.mp3|withdrew again within the limits of what their church defined as orthodox|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0255.mp3|both as he saw him in his ordinary life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0256.mp3|keeping an accustomed pathway in the range of thoughts familiar to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0257.mp3|and as he appeared when thrown amidst other moral scenery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0258.mp3|the novelty of which might call out something new to the surface of his character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0259.mp3|he deemed it essential|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0261.mp3|to know the man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0262.mp3|before attempting to do him good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0263.mp3|wherever there is a heart and an intellect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0264.mp3|the diseases of the physical frame are tinged with the peculiarities of these|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0265.mp3|in arthur dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0266.mp3|thought and imagination were so active|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0267.mp3|and sensibility so intense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0268.mp3|that the bodily infirmity would be likely to have its groundwork there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0269.mp3|so roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0270.mp3|the man of skill the kind and friendly physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0271.mp3|strove to go deep into his patient's bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0272.mp3|delving among his principles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0274.mp3|and probing everything with a cautious touch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0275.mp3|like a treasure seeker in a dark cavern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0276.mp3|few secrets can escape an investigator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0278.mp3|and skill to follow it up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0279.mp3|a man burdened with a secret should especially avoid the intimacy of his physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0280.mp3|if the latter possess native sagacity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0281.mp3|and a nameless something more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0282.mp3|let us call it intuition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0285.mp3|if he have the power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0288.mp3|that this last shall unawares have spoken what he imagines himself only to have thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0289.mp3|if such revelations be received without tumult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0290.mp3|and acknowledged not so often by an uttered sympathy as by silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0292.mp3|and here and there a word to indicate that all is understood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0295.mp3|at some inevitable moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0296.mp3|will the soul of the sufferer be dissolved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0297.mp3|and flow forth in a dark but transparent stream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0298.mp3|bringing all its mysteries into the daylight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0301.mp3|of the attributes above enumerated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0302.mp3|nevertheless time went on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0303.mp3|a kind of intimacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0304.mp3|as we have said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0305.mp3|grew up between these two cultivated minds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0306.mp3|which had as wide a field as the whole sphere of human thought and study to meet upon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0307.mp3|they discussed every topic of ethics and religion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0309.mp3|and private character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0310.mp3|they talked much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0311.mp3|on both sides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0312.mp3|of matters that seemed personal to themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0313.mp3|and yet no secret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0314.mp3|such as the physician fancied must exist there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0315.mp3|ever stole out of the minister's consciousness into his companion's ear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0318.mp3|that even the nature of mister dimmesdale's bodily disease had never fairly been revealed to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0319.mp3|it was a strange reserve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0321.mp3|at a hint from roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0322.mp3|the friends of mister dimmesdale effected an arrangement by which the two were lodged in the same house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0324.mp3|there was much joy throughout the town when this greatly desirable object was attained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0325.mp3|it was held to be the best possible measure for the young clergyman's welfare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0326.mp3|unless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0329.mp3|he had selected some one of the many blooming damsels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0330.mp3|spiritually devoted to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0331.mp3|to become his devoted wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0334.mp3|there was no present prospect that arthur dimmesdale would be prevailed upon to take|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0335.mp3|he rejected all suggestions of the kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0336.mp3|as if priestly celibacy were one of his articles of church discipline|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0337.mp3|doomed by his own choice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0339.mp3|as mister dimmesdale so evidently was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0340.mp3|to eat his unsavoury morsel always at another's board|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0344.mp3|benevolent old physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0345.mp3|with his concord of paternal and reverential love for the young pastor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0346.mp3|was the very man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0347.mp3|of all mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0348.mp3|to be constantly within reach of his voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0349.mp3|the new abode of the two friends was with a pious widow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0350.mp3|of good social rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0351.mp3|who dwelt in a house covering pretty nearly the site on which the venerable structure of king's chapel has since been built|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0352.mp3|it had the graveyard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0353.mp3|originally isaac johnson's home field|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0354.mp3|on one side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0355.mp3|and so was well adapted to call up serious reflections|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0356.mp3|suited to their respective employments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0357.mp3|in both minister and man of physic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0358.mp3|the motherly care of the good widow assigned to mister dimmesdale a front apartment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0360.mp3|and heavy window curtains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0362.mp3|the walls were hung round with tapestry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0363.mp3|said to be from the gobelin looms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0364.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0365.mp3|at all events|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0366.mp3|representing the scriptural story of david and bathsheba|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0367.mp3|and nathan the prophet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0368.mp3|in colours still unfaded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0370.mp3|here the pale clergyman piled up his library|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0371.mp3|rich with parchment bound folios of the fathers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0373.mp3|and monkish erudition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0374.mp3|of which the protestant divines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0375.mp3|even while they vilified and decried that class of writers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0376.mp3|were yet constrained often to avail themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0377.mp3|on the other side of the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0378.mp3|old roger chillingworth arranged his study and laboratory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0379.mp3|not such as a modern man of science would reckon even tolerably complete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0381.mp3|which the practised alchemist knew well how to turn to purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0382.mp3|with such commodiousness of situation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0383.mp3|these two learned persons sat themselves down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0384.mp3|each in his own domain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0385.mp3|yet familiarly passing from one apartment to the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0386.mp3|and bestowing a mutual and not incurious inspection into one another's business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0387.mp3|and the reverend arthur dimmesdale's best discerning friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0388.mp3|as we have intimated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0389.mp3|very reasonably imagined that the hand of providence had done all this for the purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0390.mp3|besought in so many public and domestic and secret prayers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0391.mp3|of restoring the young minister to health|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0392.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0393.mp3|it must now be said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0394.mp3|another portion of the community had latterly begun to take its own view of the relation betwixt mister dimmesdale and the mysterious old physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0395.mp3|when an uninstructed multitude attempts to see with its eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0396.mp3|it is exceedingly apt to be deceived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0399.mp3|it forms its judgment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0400.mp3|as it usually does|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0401.mp3|on the intuitions of its great and warm heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0403.mp3|the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0404.mp3|in the case of which we speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0405.mp3|could justify its prejudice against roger chillingworth by no fact or argument worthy of serious refutation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0406.mp3|there was an aged handicraftsman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0408.mp3|who had been a citizen of london at the period of sir thomas overbury's murder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0409.mp3|now some thirty years agone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0410.mp3|he testified to having seen the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0411.mp3|under some other name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0412.mp3|which the narrator of the story had now forgotten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0414.mp3|the famous old conjurer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0415.mp3|who was implicated in the affair of overbury|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0416.mp3|two or three individuals hinted that the man of skill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0417.mp3|during his indian captivity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0418.mp3|had enlarged his medical attainments by joining in the incantations of the savage priests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0419.mp3|who were universally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0420.mp3|often performing seemingly miraculous cures by their skill in the black art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0421.mp3|a large number|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0422.mp3|and many of these were persons of such sober sense and practical observation that their opinions would have been valuable in other matters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0423.mp3|affirmed that roger chillingworth's aspect had undergone a remarkable change while he had dwelt in town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0424.mp3|and especially since his abode with mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0425.mp3|at first his expression had been calm meditative scholar like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0426.mp3|now there was something ugly and evil in his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0427.mp3|which they had not previously noticed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0429.mp3|according to the vulgar idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0430.mp3|the fire in his laboratory had been brought from the lower regions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0431.mp3|and was fed with infernal fuel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0432.mp3|and so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0433.mp3|as might be expected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0434.mp3|his visage was getting sooty with the smoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0435.mp3|to sum up the matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0439.mp3|in all ages of the christian world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0440.mp3|was haunted either by satan himself or satan's emissary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0441.mp3|in the guise of old roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0442.mp3|this diabolical agent had the divine permission|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0443.mp3|for a season|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0445.mp3|and plot against his soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0447.mp3|it was confessed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0448.mp3|could doubt on which side the victory would turn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0449.mp3|the people looked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0450.mp3|with an unshaken hope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0451.mp3|to see the minister come forth out of the conflict transfigured with the glory which he would unquestionably win|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0452.mp3|meanwhile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0454.mp3|it was sad to think of the perchance mortal agony through which he must struggle towards his triumph|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0457.mp3|the battle was a sore one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_09_hawthorne_0458.mp3|and the victory anything but secure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0001.mp3|throughout life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0002.mp3|had been calm in temperament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0004.mp3|though not of warm affections|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0005.mp3|but ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0006.mp3|and in all his relations with the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0007.mp3|a pure and upright man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0009.mp3|as he imagined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0010.mp3|with the severe and equal integrity of a judge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0011.mp3|desirous only of truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0012.mp3|even as if the question involved no more than the air drawn lines and figures of a geometrical problem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0013.mp3|instead of human passions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0014.mp3|and wrongs inflicted on himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0016.mp3|as he proceeded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0017.mp3|a terrible fascination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0020.mp3|necessity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0022.mp3|and never set him free again until he had done all its bidding|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0023.mp3|he now dug into the poor clergyman's heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0024.mp3|like a miner searching for gold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0027.mp3|like a sexton delving into a grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0028.mp3|possibly in quest of a jewel that had been buried on the dead man's bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0029.mp3|but likely to find nothing save mortality and corruption|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0030.mp3|alas for his own soul if these were what he sought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0031.mp3|sometimes a light glimmered out of the physician's eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0032.mp3|burning blue and ominous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0033.mp3|like the reflection of a furnace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0036.mp3|like one of those gleams of ghastly fire that darted from bunyan's awful doorway in the hillside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0037.mp3|and quivered on the pilgrim's face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0039.mp3|this man said he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0040.mp3|at one such moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0042.mp3|pure as they deem him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0043.mp3|all spiritual as he seems|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0044.mp3|hath inherited a strong animal nature from his father or his mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0046.mp3|and turning over many precious materials|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0047.mp3|in the shape of high aspirations for the welfare of his race|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0048.mp3|warm love of souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0049.mp3|pure sentiments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0050.mp3|natural piety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0051.mp3|strengthened by thought and study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0052.mp3|and illuminated by revelation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0053.mp3|all of which invaluable gold was perhaps no better than rubbish to the seeker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0054.mp3|he would turn back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0055.mp3|discouraged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0056.mp3|and begin his quest towards another point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0057.mp3|he groped along as stealthily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0058.mp3|with as cautious a tread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0059.mp3|and as wary an outlook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0060.mp3|as a thief entering a chamber where a man lies only half asleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0061.mp3|or it may be broad awake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0062.mp3|with purpose to steal the very treasure which this man guards as the apple of his eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0063.mp3|in spite of his premeditated carefulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0064.mp3|the floor would now and then creak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0065.mp3|his garments would rustle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0066.mp3|the shadow of his presence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0067.mp3|in a forbidden proximity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0068.mp3|would be thrown across his victim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0070.mp3|mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0071.mp3|whose sensibility of nerve often produced the effect of spiritual intuition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0072.mp3|would become vaguely aware that something inimical to his peace had thrust itself into relation with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0073.mp3|but old roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0075.mp3|had perceptions that were almost intuitive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0076.mp3|and when the minister threw his startled eyes towards him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0077.mp3|there the physician sat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0079.mp3|yet mister dimmesdale would perhaps have seen this individual's character more perfectly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0080.mp3|if a certain morbidness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0081.mp3|to which sick hearts are liable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0082.mp3|had not rendered him suspicious of all mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0083.mp3|trusting no man as his friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0084.mp3|he could not recognize his enemy when the latter actually appeared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0085.mp3|he therefore still kept up a familiar intercourse with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0086.mp3|daily receiving the old physician in his study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0087.mp3|or visiting the laboratory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0089.mp3|for recreation's sake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0090.mp3|watching the processes by which weeds were converted into drugs of potency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0092.mp3|leaning his forehead on his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0093.mp3|and his elbow on the sill of the open window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0094.mp3|that looked towards the grave yard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0096.mp3|while the old man was examining a bundle of unsightly plants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0100.mp3|looked straight forth at any object|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0101.mp3|whether human or inanimate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0103.mp3|my kind doctor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0104.mp3|did you gather those herbs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0105.mp3|with such a dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0106.mp3|flabby leaf even in the graveyard here at hand answered the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0107.mp3|continuing his employment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0108.mp3|they are new to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0109.mp3|i found them growing on a grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0110.mp3|which bore no tombstone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0112.mp3|save these ugly weeds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0113.mp3|that have taken upon themselves to keep him in remembrance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0114.mp3|they grew out of his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0117.mp3|some hideous secret that was buried with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0118.mp3|and which he had done better to confess during his lifetime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0119.mp3|perchance said mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0120.mp3|he earnestly desired it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0121.mp3|but could not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0122.mp3|and wherefore rejoined the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0123.mp3|wherefore not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0124.mp3|since all the powers of nature call so earnestly for the confession of sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0125.mp3|that these black weeds have sprung up out of a buried heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0133.mp3|short of the divine mercy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0134.mp3|to disclose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0135.mp3|whether by uttered words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0136.mp3|or by type or emblem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0139.mp3|making itself guilty of such secrets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0140.mp3|must perforce hold them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0141.mp3|until the day when all hidden things shall be revealed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0142.mp3|nor have i so read or interpreted holy writ|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0143.mp3|as to understand that the disclosure of human thoughts and deeds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0144.mp3|then to be made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0146.mp3|that surely were a shallow view of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0148.mp3|these revelations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0150.mp3|are meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfaction of all intelligent beings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0151.mp3|who will stand waiting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0152.mp3|on that day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0153.mp3|to see the dark problem of this life made plain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0154.mp3|a knowledge of men's hearts will be needful to the completest solution of that problem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0157.mp3|that the hearts holding such miserable secrets as you speak of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0158.mp3|will yield them up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0159.mp3|at that last day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0160.mp3|not with reluctance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0161.mp3|but with a joy unutterable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0163.mp3|glancing quietly aside at the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0164.mp3|why should not the guilty ones sooner avail themselves of this unutterable solace they mostly do said the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0166.mp3|as if afflicted with an importunate throb of pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0167.mp3|many|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0168.mp3|many a poor soul hath given its confidence to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0170.mp3|but while strong in life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0171.mp3|and fair in reputation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0172.mp3|and ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0173.mp3|after such an outpouring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0175.mp3|what a relief have i witnessed in those sinful brethren|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0176.mp3|even as in one who at last draws free air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0178.mp3|how can it be otherwise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0179.mp3|why should a wretched man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0180.mp3|guilty we will say of murder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0181.mp3|prefer to keep the dead corpse buried in his own heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0182.mp3|rather than fling it forth at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0183.mp3|and let the universe take care of it yet some men bury their secrets thus observed the calm physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0184.mp3|true there are such men answered mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0185.mp3|but not to suggest more obvious reasons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0186.mp3|it may be that they are kept silent by the very constitution of their nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0187.mp3|or can we not suppose it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0188.mp3|guilty as they may be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0190.mp3|nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0192.mp3|they shrink from displaying themselves black and filthy in the view of men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0193.mp3|because thenceforward no good can be achieved by them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0194.mp3|no evil of the past be redeemed by better service|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0197.mp3|they go about among their fellow creatures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0198.mp3|looking pure as new fallen snow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0199.mp3|while their hearts are all speckled and spotted with iniquity of which they cannot rid themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0200.mp3|these men deceive themselves said roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0201.mp3|with somewhat more emphasis than usual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0202.mp3|and making a slight gesture with his forefinger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0203.mp3|they fear to take up the shame that rightfully belongs to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0204.mp3|their love for man their zeal for god's service|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0206.mp3|and which must needs propagate a hellish breed within them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0207.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0208.mp3|if they seek to glorify god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0209.mp3|let them not lift heavenward their unclean hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0211.mp3|let them do it by making manifest the power and reality of conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0212.mp3|in constraining them to penitential self abasement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0215.mp3|that a false show can be better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0217.mp3|than god's own truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0224.mp3|of escaping from any topic that agitated his too sensitive and nervous temperament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0227.mp3|i would ask of my well skilled physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0229.mp3|in good sooth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0230.mp3|he deems me to have profited by his kindly care of this weak frame of mine before roger chillingworth could answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0231.mp3|they heard the clear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0232.mp3|wild laughter of a young child's voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0233.mp3|proceeding from the adjacent burial ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0234.mp3|looking instinctively from the open window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0235.mp3|for it was summer time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0237.mp3|pearl looked as beautiful as the day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0238.mp3|but was in one of those moods of perverse merriment which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0239.mp3|whenever they occurred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0240.mp3|seemed to remove her entirely out of the sphere of sympathy or human contact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0241.mp3|she now skipped irreverently from one grave to another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0242.mp3|until coming to the broad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0245.mp3|perhaps of isaac johnson himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0246.mp3|she began to dance upon it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0247.mp3|in reply to her mother's command and entreaty that she would behave more decorously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0249.mp3|taking a handful of these|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0250.mp3|she arranged them along the lines of the scarlet letter that decorated the maternal bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0252.mp3|as their nature was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0253.mp3|tenaciously adhered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0254.mp3|hester did not pluck them off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0255.mp3|roger chillingworth had by this time approached the window and smiled grimly down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0256.mp3|there is no law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0257.mp3|nor reverence for authority|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0258.mp3|no regard for human ordinances or opinions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0259.mp3|right or wrong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0260.mp3|mixed up with that child's composition remarked he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0261.mp3|as much to himself as to his companion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0263.mp3|the other day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0265.mp3|what in heaven's name is she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0267.mp3|hath she affections|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0270.mp3|in a quiet way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0271.mp3|as if he had been discussing the point within himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0272.mp3|whether capable of good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0274.mp3|the child probably overheard their voices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0276.mp3|looking up to the window with a bright|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0277.mp3|but naughty smile of mirth and intelligence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0279.mp3|mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0281.mp3|with nervous dread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0282.mp3|from the light missile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0283.mp3|detecting his emotion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0287.mp3|had involuntarily looked up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0288.mp3|and all these four persons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0289.mp3|old and young|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0290.mp3|regarded one another in silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0291.mp3|till the child laughed aloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0293.mp3|come away mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0296.mp3|come away mother or he will catch you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0300.mp3|and frisking fantastically among the hillocks of the dead people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0301.mp3|like a creature that had nothing in common with a bygone and buried generation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0303.mp3|it was as if she had been made afresh out of new elements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0305.mp3|and be a law unto herself without her eccentricities being reckoned to her for a crime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0309.mp3|be her demerits what they may|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0310.mp3|hath none of that mystery of hidden sinfulness which you deem so grievous to be borne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0313.mp3|for that scarlet letter on her breast i do verily believe it answered the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0314.mp3|nevertheless i cannot answer for her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0315.mp3|there was a look of pain in her face which i would gladly have been spared the sight of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0316.mp3|but still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0318.mp3|it must needs be better for the sufferer to be free to show his pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0319.mp3|as this poor woman hester is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0320.mp3|than to cover it up in his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0321.mp3|there was another pause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0322.mp3|and the physician began anew to examine and arrange the plants which he had gathered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0326.mp3|my judgment as touching your health|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0327.mp3|i did answered the clergyman and would gladly learn it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0328.mp3|speak frankly i pray you be it for life or death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0330.mp3|and plainly said the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0331.mp3|still busy with his plants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0332.mp3|but keeping a wary eye on mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0333.mp3|the disorder is a strange one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0339.mp3|and watching the tokens of your aspect now for months gone by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0340.mp3|i should deem you a man sore sick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0341.mp3|it may be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0342.mp3|yet not so sick but that an instructed and watchful physician might well hope to cure you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0343.mp3|but i know not what to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0344.mp3|the disease is what i seem to know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0348.mp3|glancing aside out of the window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0350.mp3|to speak more plainly continued the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0353.mp3|should it seem to require pardon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0354.mp3|for this needful plainness of my speech|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0355.mp3|let me ask as your friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0356.mp3|as one having charge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0358.mp3|of your life and physical well being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0362.mp3|that i know all said roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0364.mp3|and fixing an eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0367.mp3|be it so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0368.mp3|but again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0369.mp3|he to whom only the outward and physical evil is laid open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0371.mp3|oftentimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0372.mp3|but half the evil which he is called upon to cure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0373.mp3|a bodily disease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0375.mp3|may|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0376.mp3|after all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0377.mp3|be but a symptom of some ailment in the spiritual part|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0378.mp3|your pardon once again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0380.mp3|if my speech give the shadow of offence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0383.mp3|of all men whom i have known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0384.mp3|are he whose body is the closest conjoined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0385.mp3|and imbued|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0386.mp3|and identified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0387.mp3|so to speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0388.mp3|with the spirit whereof it is the instrument|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0389.mp3|then i need ask no further said the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0390.mp3|somewhat hastily rising from his chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0393.mp3|in medicine for the soul thus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0394.mp3|a sickness continued roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0396.mp3|in an unaltered tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0397.mp3|without heeding the interruption|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0398.mp3|but standing up and confronting the emaciated and white cheeked minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0403.mp3|a sore place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0404.mp3|if we may so call it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0407.mp3|how may this be unless you first lay open to him the wound or trouble in your soul no|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0409.mp3|not to an earthly physician cried mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0412.mp3|full and bright|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0415.mp3|not to thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0418.mp3|then do i commit myself to the one physician of the soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0420.mp3|let him do with me as in his justice and wisdom he shall see good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0421.mp3|but who art thou that meddlest in this matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0423.mp3|it is as well to have made this step said roger chillingworth to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0426.mp3|there is nothing lost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0427.mp3|we shall be friends again anon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0431.mp3|and hurrieth him out of himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0432.mp3|as with one passion so with another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0434.mp3|this pious master dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0435.mp3|in the hot passion of his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0437.mp3|on the same footing and in the same degree as heretofore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0438.mp3|the young clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0439.mp3|after a few hours of privacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0440.mp3|was sensible that the disorder of his nerves had hurried him into an unseemly outbreak of temper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0441.mp3|which there had been nothing in the physician's words to excuse or palliate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0443.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0444.mp3|at the violence with which he had thrust back the kind old man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0445.mp3|when merely proffering the advice which it was his duty to bestow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0446.mp3|and which the minister himself had expressly sought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0447.mp3|with these remorseful feelings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0448.mp3|he lost no time in making the amplest apologies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0449.mp3|and besought his friend still to continue the care which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0450.mp3|if not successful in restoring him to health|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0452.mp3|in all probability|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0453.mp3|been the means of prolonging his feeble existence to that hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0454.mp3|roger chillingworth readily assented|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0455.mp3|and went on with his medical supervision of the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0458.mp3|but always quitting the patient's apartment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0460.mp3|with a mysterious and puzzled smile upon his lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0461.mp3|this expression was invisible in mister dimmesdale's presence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0462.mp3|but grew strongly evident as the physician crossed the threshold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0463.mp3|a rare case he muttered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0464.mp3|i must needs look deeper into it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0465.mp3|a strange sympathy betwixt soul and body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0466.mp3|were it only for the art's sake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0467.mp3|i must search this matter to the bottom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0468.mp3|it came to pass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0469.mp3|not long after the scene above recorded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0470.mp3|that the reverend mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0472.mp3|and entirely unawares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0473.mp3|fell into a deep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0474.mp3|deep slumber|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0475.mp3|sitting in his chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0477.mp3|it must have been a work of vast ability in the somniferous school of literature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0478.mp3|the profound depth of the minister's repose was the more remarkable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0479.mp3|inasmuch as he was one of those persons whose sleep ordinarily is as light as fitful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0480.mp3|and as easily scared away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0481.mp3|as a small bird hopping on a twig|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0485.mp3|without any extraordinary precaution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0486.mp3|came into the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0487.mp3|the physician advanced directly in front of his patient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0488.mp3|laid his hand upon his bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0489.mp3|and thrust aside the vestment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0490.mp3|that hitherto had always covered it even from the professional eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0491.mp3|then indeed mister dimmesdale shuddered and slightly stirred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0492.mp3|after a brief pause the physician turned away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0493.mp3|but with what a wild look of wonder joy and horror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0494.mp3|with what a ghastly rapture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0496.mp3|too mighty to be expressed only by the eye and features|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0497.mp3|and therefore bursting forth through the whole ugliness of his figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0499.mp3|and stamped his foot upon the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0500.mp3|had a man seen old roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0501.mp3|at that moment of his ecstasy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0502.mp3|he would have had no need to ask how satan comports himself when a precious human soul is lost to heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_10_hawthorne_0504.mp3|but what distinguished the physician's ecstasy from satan's was the trait of wonder in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0001.mp3|the intercourse between the clergyman and the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0002.mp3|though externally the same|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0003.mp3|was really of another character than it had previously been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0004.mp3|the intellect of roger chillingworth had now a sufficiently plain path before it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0006.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0007.mp3|precisely that which he had laid out for himself to tread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0015.mp3|hitherto latent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0016.mp3|but active now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0017.mp3|in this unfortunate old man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0019.mp3|to make himself the one trusted friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0020.mp3|to whom should be confided all the fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0021.mp3|the remorse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0022.mp3|the agony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0023.mp3|the ineffectual repentance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0024.mp3|the backward rush of sinful thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0025.mp3|expelled in vain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0026.mp3|all that guilty sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0027.mp3|hidden from the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0028.mp3|whose great heart would have pitied and forgiven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0029.mp3|to be revealed to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0030.mp3|the pitiless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0031.mp3|to him the unforgiving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0032.mp3|all that dark treasure to be lavished on the very man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0033.mp3|to whom nothing else could so adequately pay the debt of vengeance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0037.mp3|was inclined to be hardly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0039.mp3|less satisfied with the aspect of affairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0040.mp3|which providence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0041.mp3|using the avenger and his victim for its own purposes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0046.mp3|had substituted for his black devices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0047.mp3|a revelation he could almost say had been granted to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0048.mp3|it mattered little for his object|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0050.mp3|by its aid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0051.mp3|in all the subsequent relations betwixt him and mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0052.mp3|not merely the external presence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0053.mp3|but the very inmost soul of the latter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0054.mp3|seemed to be brought out before his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0055.mp3|so that he could see and comprehend its every movement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0057.mp3|thenceforth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0058.mp3|not a spectator only|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0059.mp3|but a chief actor in the poor minister's interior world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0060.mp3|he could play upon him as he chose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0061.mp3|would he arouse him with a throb of agony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0063.mp3|it needed only to know the spring that controlled the engine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0064.mp3|and the physician knew it well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0065.mp3|would he startle him with sudden fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0067.mp3|up rose a thousand phantoms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0068.mp3|in many shapes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0072.mp3|and pointing with their fingers at his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0073.mp3|all this was accomplished with a subtlety so perfect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0074.mp3|that the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0075.mp3|though he had constantly a dim perception of some evil influence watching over him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0076.mp3|could never gain a knowledge of its actual nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0077.mp3|true he looked doubtfully fearfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0078.mp3|even at times with horror and the bitterness of hatred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0079.mp3|at the deformed figure of the old physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0080.mp3|his gestures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0082.mp3|his grizzled beard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0083.mp3|his slightest and most indifferent acts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0084.mp3|the very fashion of his garments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0085.mp3|were odious in the clergyman's sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0086.mp3|a token implicitly to be relied on of a deeper antipathy in the breast of the latter than he was willing to acknowledge to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0089.mp3|so mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0090.mp3|conscious that the poison of one morbid spot was infecting his heart's entire substance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0091.mp3|attributed all his presentiments to no other cause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0092.mp3|he took himself to task for his bad sympathies in reference to roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0093.mp3|disregarded the lesson that he should have drawn from them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0094.mp3|and did his best to root them out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0095.mp3|unable to accomplish this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0097.mp3|as a matter of principle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0098.mp3|continued his habits of social familiarity with the old man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0099.mp3|and thus gave him constant opportunities for perfecting the purpose to which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0100.mp3|poor forlorn creature that he was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0101.mp3|and more wretched than his victim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0102.mp3|the avenger had devoted himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0103.mp3|while thus suffering under bodily disease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0104.mp3|and gnawed and tortured by some black trouble of the soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0105.mp3|and given over to the machinations of his deadliest enemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0106.mp3|the reverend mister dimmesdale had achieved a brilliant popularity in his sacred office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0107.mp3|he won it indeed in great part by his sorrows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0108.mp3|his intellectual gifts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0109.mp3|his moral perceptions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0110.mp3|his power of experiencing and communicating emotion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0111.mp3|were kept in a state of preternatural activity by the prick and anguish of his daily life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0112.mp3|his fame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0115.mp3|eminent as several of them were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0118.mp3|connected with the divine profession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0120.mp3|and who might well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0122.mp3|be more profoundly versed in such solid and valuable attainments than their youthful brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0125.mp3|of a sturdier texture of mind than his|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0126.mp3|and endowed with a far greater share of shrewd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0130.mp3|duly mingled with a fair proportion of doctrinal ingredient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0133.mp3|and unamiable variety of the clerical species|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0134.mp3|there were others again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0135.mp3|true saintly fathers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0136.mp3|whose faculties had been elaborated by weary toil among their books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0137.mp3|and by patient thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0139.mp3|moreover|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0140.mp3|by spiritual communications with the better world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0141.mp3|into which their purity of life had almost introduced these holy personages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0142.mp3|with their garments of mortality still clinging to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0145.mp3|in tongues of flame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0147.mp3|it would seem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0148.mp3|not the power of speech in foreign and unknown languages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0149.mp3|but that of addressing the whole human brotherhood in the heart's native language|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0150.mp3|these fathers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0151.mp3|otherwise so apostolic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0152.mp3|lacked heaven's last and rarest attestation of their office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0153.mp3|the tongue of flame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0154.mp3|they would have vainly sought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0155.mp3|had they ever dreamed of seeking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0156.mp3|to express the highest truths through the humblest medium of familiar words and images|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0157.mp3|their voices came down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0158.mp3|afar and indistinctly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0159.mp3|from the upper heights where they habitually dwelt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0160.mp3|not improbably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0161.mp3|it was to this latter class of men that mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0162.mp3|by many of his traits of character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0163.mp3|naturally belonged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0164.mp3|to the high mountain peaks of faith and sanctity he would have climbed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0165.mp3|had not the tendency been thwarted by the burden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0166.mp3|whatever it might be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0167.mp3|of crime or anguish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0168.mp3|beneath which it was his doom to totter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0169.mp3|it kept him down on a level with the lowest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0171.mp3|the man of ethereal attributes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0172.mp3|whose voice the angels might else have listened to and answered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0173.mp3|but this very burden it was that gave him sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0174.mp3|so that his heart vibrated in unison with theirs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0176.mp3|in gushes of sad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0177.mp3|persuasive eloquence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0178.mp3|oftenest persuasive but sometimes terrible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0179.mp3|the people knew not the power that moved them thus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0180.mp3|they deemed the young clergyman a miracle of holiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0183.mp3|and love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0184.mp3|in their eyes the very ground on which he trod was sanctified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0185.mp3|the virgins of his church grew pale around him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0186.mp3|victims of a passion so imbued with religious sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0187.mp3|that they imagined it to be all religion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0188.mp3|and brought it openly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0189.mp3|in their white bosoms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0190.mp3|as their most acceptable sacrifice before the altar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0191.mp3|the aged members of his flock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0192.mp3|beholding mister dimmesdale's frame so feeble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0193.mp3|while they were themselves so rugged in their infirmity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0194.mp3|believed that he would go heavenward before them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0195.mp3|and enjoined it upon their children that their old bones should be buried close to their young pastor's holy grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0196.mp3|and all this time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0198.mp3|when poor mister dimmesdale was thinking of his grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0199.mp3|he questioned with himself whether the grass would ever grow on it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0200.mp3|because an accursed thing must there be buried|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0201.mp3|it is inconceivable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0202.mp3|the agony with which this public veneration tortured him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0203.mp3|it was his genuine impulse to adore the truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0204.mp3|and to reckon all things shadow like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0205.mp3|and utterly devoid of weight or value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0206.mp3|that had not its divine essence as the life within their life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0207.mp3|then what was he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0208.mp3|a substance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0210.mp3|he longed to speak out from his own pulpit at the full height of his voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0211.mp3|and tell the people what he was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0212.mp3|i whom you behold in these black garments of the priesthood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0213.mp3|who ascend the sacred desk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0214.mp3|and turn my pale face heavenward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0216.mp3|i in whose daily life you discern the sanctity of enoch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0217.mp3|whose footsteps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0218.mp3|as you suppose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0219.mp3|leave a gleam along my earthly track|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0220.mp3|whereby the pilgrims that shall come after me may be guided to the regions of the blest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0221.mp3|i who have laid the hand of baptism upon your children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0222.mp3|who have breathed the parting prayer over your dying friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0223.mp3|to whom the amen sounded faintly from a world which they had quitted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0224.mp3|your pastor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0225.mp3|whom you so reverence and trust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0226.mp3|am utterly a pollution and a lie more than once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0227.mp3|mister dimmesdale had gone into the pulpit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0228.mp3|with a purpose never to come down its steps until he should have spoken words like the above|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0229.mp3|more than once he had cleared his throat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0230.mp3|and drawn in the long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0232.mp3|and tremulous breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0234.mp3|when sent forth again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0235.mp3|would come burdened with the black secret of his soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0236.mp3|more than once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0237.mp3|nay more than a hundred times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0238.mp3|he had actually spoken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0243.mp3|the worst of sinners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0244.mp3|an abomination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0245.mp3|a thing of unimaginable iniquity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0247.mp3|could there be plainer speech than this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0248.mp3|would not the people start up in their seats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0249.mp3|by a simultaneous impulse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0250.mp3|and tear him down out of the pulpit which he defiled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0251.mp3|not so indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0252.mp3|they heard it all and did but reverence him the more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0253.mp3|they little guessed what deadly purport lurked in those self condemning words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0254.mp3|the godly youth said they among themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0255.mp3|the saint on earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0258.mp3|what horrid spectacle would he behold in thine or mine the minister well knew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0259.mp3|subtle but remorseful hypocrite that he was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0260.mp3|the light in which his vague confession would be viewed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0262.mp3|but had gained only one other sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0263.mp3|and a self acknowledged shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0264.mp3|without the momentary relief of being self deceived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0265.mp3|he had spoken the very truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0267.mp3|and yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0268.mp3|by the constitution of his nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0269.mp3|he loved the truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0270.mp3|and loathed the lie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0271.mp3|as few men ever did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0272.mp3|therefore above all things else he loathed his miserable self|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0273.mp3|his inward trouble drove him to practices more in accordance with the old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0274.mp3|corrupted faith of rome than with the better light of the church in which he had been born and bred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0275.mp3|in mister dimmesdale's secret closet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0276.mp3|under lock and key|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0277.mp3|there was a bloody scourge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0279.mp3|this protestant and puritan divine had plied it on his own shoulders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0280.mp3|laughing bitterly at himself the while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0281.mp3|and smiting so much the more pitilessly because of that bitter laugh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0284.mp3|as it has been that of many other pious puritans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0285.mp3|to fast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0288.mp3|in order to purify the body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0289.mp3|and render it the fitter medium of celestial illumination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0290.mp3|but rigorously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0291.mp3|and until his knees trembled beneath him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0292.mp3|as an act of penance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0293.mp3|he kept vigils|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0295.mp3|night after night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0296.mp3|sometimes in utter darkness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0297.mp3|sometimes with a glimmering lamp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0298.mp3|and sometimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0299.mp3|viewing his own face in a looking glass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0300.mp3|by the most powerful light which he could throw upon it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0301.mp3|he thus typified the constant introspection wherewith he tortured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0302.mp3|but could not purify himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0303.mp3|in these lengthened vigils|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0304.mp3|his brain often reeled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0305.mp3|and visions seemed to flit before him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0307.mp3|and by a faint light of their own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0308.mp3|in the remote dimness of the chamber|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0309.mp3|or more vividly and close beside him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0310.mp3|within the looking glass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0311.mp3|now it was a herd of diabolic shapes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0312.mp3|that grinned and mocked at the pale minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0313.mp3|and beckoned him away with them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0314.mp3|now a group of shining angels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0315.mp3|who flew upward heavily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0318.mp3|now came the dead friends of his youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0319.mp3|and his white bearded father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0320.mp3|with a saint like frown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0321.mp3|and his mother turning her face away as she passed by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0322.mp3|ghost of a mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0325.mp3|and now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0326.mp3|through the chamber which these spectral thoughts had made so ghastly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0328.mp3|in her scarlet garb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0329.mp3|and pointing her forefinger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0330.mp3|first at the scarlet letter on her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0332.mp3|none of these visions ever quite deluded him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0333.mp3|at any moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0334.mp3|by an effort of his will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0335.mp3|he could discern substances through their misty lack of substance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0337.mp3|like yonder table of carved oak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0342.mp3|for all that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0345.mp3|the truest and most substantial things which the poor minister now dealt with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0346.mp3|it is the unspeakable misery of a life so false as his|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0347.mp3|that it steals the pith and substance out of whatever realities there are around us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0348.mp3|and which were meant by heaven to be the spirit's joy and nutriment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0349.mp3|to the untrue man the whole universe is false|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0350.mp3|it is impalpable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0351.mp3|it shrinks to nothing within his grasp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0352.mp3|and he himself in so far as he shows himself in a false light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0353.mp3|becomes a shadow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0356.mp3|ceases to exist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0357.mp3|the only truth that continued to give mister dimmesdale a real existence on this earth was the anguish in his inmost soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0358.mp3|and the undissembled expression of it in his aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0359.mp3|had he once found power to smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0361.mp3|there would have been no such man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0362.mp3|on one of those ugly nights|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0363.mp3|which we have faintly hinted at|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0364.mp3|but forborne to picture forth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0365.mp3|the minister started from his chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0366.mp3|a new thought had struck him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0367.mp3|there might be a moment's peace in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0368.mp3|attiring himself with as much care as if it had been for public worship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0370.mp3|he stole softly down the staircase|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_11_hawthorne_0372.mp3|and issued forth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0000.mp3|walking in the shadow of a dream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0003.mp3|mister dimmesdale reached the spot where|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0004.mp3|now so long since|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0005.mp3|hester prynne had lived through her first hours of public ignominy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0006.mp3|the same platform or scaffold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0007.mp3|black and weather stained with the storm or sunshine of seven long years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0010.mp3|with the tread of many culprits who had since ascended it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0011.mp3|remained standing beneath the balcony of the meeting house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0012.mp3|the minister went up the steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0015.mp3|if the same multitude which had stood as eye witnesses while hester prynne sustained her punishment could now have been summoned forth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0016.mp3|they would have discerned no face above the platform nor hardly the outline of a human shape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0017.mp3|in the dark grey of the midnight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0018.mp3|but the town was all asleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0019.mp3|there was no peril of discovery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0020.mp3|the minister might stand there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0021.mp3|if it so pleased him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0022.mp3|until morning should redden in the east|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0023.mp3|without other risk than that the dank and chill night air would creep into his frame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0024.mp3|and stiffen his joints with rheumatism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0026.mp3|thereby defrauding the expectant audience of to morrow's prayer and sermon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0027.mp3|no eye could see him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0028.mp3|save that ever wakeful one which had seen him in his closet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0029.mp3|wielding the bloody scourge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0030.mp3|why then had he come hither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0031.mp3|was it but the mockery of penitence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0032.mp3|a mockery indeed but in which his soul trifled with itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0033.mp3|a mockery at which angels blushed and wept|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0035.mp3|he had been driven hither by the impulse of that remorse which dogged him everywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0036.mp3|and whose own sister and closely linked companion was that cowardice which invariably drew him back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0037.mp3|with her tremulous gripe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0038.mp3|just when the other impulse had hurried him to the verge of a disclosure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0039.mp3|poor miserable man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0040.mp3|what right had infirmity like his to burden itself with crime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0042.mp3|who have their choice either to endure it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0045.mp3|to exert their fierce and savage strength for a good purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0046.mp3|and fling it off at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0047.mp3|this feeble and most sensitive of spirits could do neither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0048.mp3|yet continually did one thing or another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0049.mp3|which intertwined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0050.mp3|in the same inextricable knot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0051.mp3|the agony of heaven defying guilt and vain repentance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0052.mp3|and thus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0053.mp3|while standing on the scaffold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0054.mp3|in this vain show of expiation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0055.mp3|mister dimmesdale was overcome with a great horror of mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0056.mp3|as if the universe were gazing at a scarlet token on his naked breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0057.mp3|right over his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0058.mp3|on that spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0060.mp3|there was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0062.mp3|the gnawing and poisonous tooth of bodily pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0063.mp3|without any effort of his will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0064.mp3|or power to restrain himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0065.mp3|he shrieked aloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0066.mp3|an outcry that went pealing through the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0067.mp3|and was beaten back from one house to another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0068.mp3|and reverberated from the hills in the background|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0069.mp3|as if a company of devils|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0070.mp3|detecting so much misery and terror in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0071.mp3|had made a plaything of the sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0072.mp3|and were bandying it to and fro|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0073.mp3|it is done muttered the minister covering his face with his hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0074.mp3|the whole town will awake and hurry forth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0075.mp3|and find me here but it was not so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0076.mp3|the shriek had perhaps sounded with a far greater power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0077.mp3|to his own startled ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0078.mp3|than it actually possessed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0079.mp3|the town did not awake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0082.mp3|the drowsy slumberers mistook the cry either for something frightful in a dream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0083.mp3|or for the noise of witches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0085.mp3|at that period|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0086.mp3|were often heard to pass over the settlements or lonely cottages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0087.mp3|as they rode with satan through the air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0090.mp3|hearing no symptoms of disturbance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0091.mp3|uncovered his eyes and looked about him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0092.mp3|at one of the chamber windows of governor bellingham's mansion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0093.mp3|which stood at some distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0094.mp3|on the line of another street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0095.mp3|he beheld the appearance of the old magistrate himself with a lamp in his hand a white night cap on his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0096.mp3|and a long white gown enveloping his figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0097.mp3|he looked like a ghost evoked unseasonably from the grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0098.mp3|the cry had evidently startled him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0101.mp3|the governor's sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0102.mp3|also with a lamp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0103.mp3|which even thus far off revealed the expression of her sour and discontented face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0105.mp3|and looked anxiously upward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0106.mp3|beyond the shadow of a doubt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0107.mp3|this venerable witch lady had heard mister dimmesdale's outcry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0108.mp3|and interpreted it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0109.mp3|with its multitudinous echoes and reverberations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0110.mp3|as the clamour of the fiends and night hags|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0112.mp3|detecting the gleam of governor bellingham's lamp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0114.mp3|and vanished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0115.mp3|possibly she went up among the clouds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0116.mp3|the minister saw nothing further of her motions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0117.mp3|the magistrate after a wary observation of the darkness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0118.mp3|into which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0121.mp3|retired from the window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0122.mp3|the minister grew comparatively calm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0123.mp3|his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0126.mp3|which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0127.mp3|at first a long way off was approaching up the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0130.mp3|and there a garden fence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0133.mp3|with its full trough of water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0134.mp3|and here again an arched door of oak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0135.mp3|with an iron knocker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0136.mp3|and a rough log for the door step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0137.mp3|the reverend mister dimmesdale noted all these minute particulars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0138.mp3|even while firmly convinced that the doom of his existence was stealing onward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0139.mp3|in the footsteps which he now heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0140.mp3|and that the gleam of the lantern would fall upon him in a few moments more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0141.mp3|and reveal his long hidden secret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0142.mp3|as the light drew nearer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0143.mp3|he beheld|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0144.mp3|within its illuminated circle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0145.mp3|his brother clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0147.mp3|to speak more accurately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0148.mp3|his professional father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0149.mp3|as well as highly valued friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0150.mp3|the reverend mister wilson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0152.mp3|as mister dimmesdale now conjectured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0153.mp3|had been praying at the bedside of some dying man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0154.mp3|and so he had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0155.mp3|the good old minister came freshly from the death chamber of governor winthrop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0156.mp3|who had passed from earth to heaven within that very hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0157.mp3|and now surrounded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0159.mp3|with a radiant halo|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0160.mp3|that glorified him amid this gloomy night of sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0161.mp3|as if the departed governor had left him an inheritance of his glory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0162.mp3|or as if he had caught upon himself the distant shine of the celestial city|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0163.mp3|while looking thitherward to see the triumphant pilgrim pass within its gates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0165.mp3|in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0166.mp3|good father wilson was moving homeward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0167.mp3|aiding his footsteps with a lighted lantern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0168.mp3|the glimmer of this luminary suggested the above conceits to mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0169.mp3|who smiled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0170.mp3|nay almost laughed at them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0172.mp3|as the reverend mister wilson passed beside the scaffold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0173.mp3|closely muffling his geneva cloak about him with one arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0174.mp3|and holding the lantern before his breast with the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0175.mp3|the minister could hardly restrain himself from speaking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0176.mp3|a good evening to you venerable father wilson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0179.mp3|and pass a pleasant hour with me good heavens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0180.mp3|had mister dimmesdale actually spoken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0181.mp3|for one instant he believed that these words had passed his lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0182.mp3|but they were uttered only within his imagination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0183.mp3|the venerable father wilson continued to step slowly onward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0184.mp3|looking carefully at the muddy pathway before his feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0185.mp3|and never once turning his head towards the guilty platform|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0186.mp3|when the light of the glimmering lantern had faded quite away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0187.mp3|the minister discovered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0188.mp3|by the faintness which came over him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0189.mp3|that the last few moments had been a crisis of terrible anxiety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0190.mp3|although his mind had made an involuntary effort to relieve itself by a kind of lurid playfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0191.mp3|shortly afterwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0193.mp3|he felt his limbs growing stiff with the unaccustomed chilliness of the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0194.mp3|and doubted whether he should be able to descend the steps of the scaffold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0195.mp3|morning would break and find him there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0196.mp3|the neighbourhood would begin to rouse itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0197.mp3|the earliest riser|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0198.mp3|coming forth in the dim twilight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0199.mp3|would perceive a vaguely defined figure aloft on the place of shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0200.mp3|and half crazed betwixt alarm and curiosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0201.mp3|would go knocking from door to door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0202.mp3|summoning all the people to behold the ghost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0203.mp3|as he needs must think it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0204.mp3|of some defunct transgressor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0205.mp3|a dusky tumult would flap its wings from one house to another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0207.mp3|the morning light still waxing stronger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0208.mp3|old patriarchs would rise up in great haste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0209.mp3|each in his flannel gown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0210.mp3|and matronly dames|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0211.mp3|without pausing to put off their night gear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0212.mp3|the whole tribe of decorous personages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0214.mp3|would start into public view with the disorder of a nightmare in their aspects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0215.mp3|old governor bellingham would come grimly forth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0217.mp3|and mistress hibbins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0218.mp3|with some twigs of the forest clinging to her skirts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0219.mp3|and looking sourer than ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0220.mp3|as having hardly got a wink of sleep after her night ride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0221.mp3|and good father wilson too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0222.mp3|after spending half the night at a death bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0223.mp3|and liking ill to be disturbed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0225.mp3|out of his dreams about the glorified saints|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0228.mp3|would come the elders and deacons of mister dimmesdale's church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0229.mp3|and the young virgins who so idolized their minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0230.mp3|and had made a shrine for him in their white bosoms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0231.mp3|which now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0233.mp3|in their hurry and confusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0237.mp3|would come stumbling over their thresholds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0238.mp3|and turning up their amazed and horror stricken visages around the scaffold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0239.mp3|whom would they discern there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0240.mp3|with the red eastern light upon his brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0242.mp3|but the reverend arthur dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0243.mp3|half frozen to death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0244.mp3|overwhelmed with shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0245.mp3|and standing where hester prynne had stood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0246.mp3|carried away by the grotesque horror of this picture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0247.mp3|the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0248.mp3|unawares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0249.mp3|and to his own infinite alarm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0250.mp3|burst into a great peal of laughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0251.mp3|it was immediately responded to by a light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0253.mp3|childish laugh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0254.mp3|in which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0255.mp3|with a thrill of the heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0256.mp3|but he knew not whether of exquisite pain or pleasure as acute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0259.mp3|little pearl cried he after a moment's pause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0260.mp3|then suppressing his voice hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0262.mp3|are you there yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0263.mp3|it is hester prynne she replied in a tone of surprise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0265.mp3|along which she had been passing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0266.mp3|it is i and my little pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0269.mp3|and have taken his measure for a robe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0270.mp3|and am now going homeward to my dwelling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0273.mp3|thou and little pearl said the reverend mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0274.mp3|ye have both been here before but i was not with you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0275.mp3|come up hither once again and we will stand all three together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0276.mp3|she silently ascended the steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0277.mp3|and stood on the platform|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0278.mp3|holding little pearl by the hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0279.mp3|the minister felt for the child's other hand and took it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0280.mp3|the moment that he did so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0281.mp3|there came what seemed a tumultuous rush of new life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0282.mp3|other life than his own pouring like a torrent into his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0283.mp3|and hurrying through all his veins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0284.mp3|as if the mother and the child were communicating their vital warmth to his half torpid system|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0285.mp3|the three formed an electric chain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0286.mp3|minister whispered little pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0287.mp3|what wouldst thou say child asked mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0288.mp3|wilt thou stand here with mother and me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0289.mp3|to morrow noontide inquired pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0291.mp3|not so my little pearl answered the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0293.mp3|with the new energy of the moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0294.mp3|all the dread of public exposure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0295.mp3|that had so long been the anguish of his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0296.mp3|had returned upon him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0297.mp3|and he was already trembling at the conjunction in which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0298.mp3|with a strange joy nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0299.mp3|he now found himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0300.mp3|not so my child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0303.mp3|stand with thy mother and thee one other day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0304.mp3|but not to morrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0305.mp3|pearl laughed and attempted to pull away her hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0306.mp3|but the minister held it fast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0307.mp3|a moment longer my child said he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0309.mp3|to take my hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0313.mp3|but another time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0314.mp3|and what other time persisted the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0316.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0317.mp3|strangely enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0318.mp3|the sense that he was a professional teacher of the truth impelled him to answer the child so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0321.mp3|before the judgment seat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0324.mp3|and i must stand together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0325.mp3|but the daylight of this world shall not see our meeting pearl laughed again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0326.mp3|but before mister dimmesdale had done speaking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0327.mp3|a light gleamed far and wide over all the muffled sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0328.mp3|it was doubtless caused by one of those meteors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0329.mp3|which the night watcher may so often observe burning out to waste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0330.mp3|in the vacant regions of the atmosphere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0331.mp3|so powerful was its radiance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0332.mp3|that it thoroughly illuminated the dense medium of cloud betwixt the sky and earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0334.mp3|it showed the familiar scene of the street with the distinctness of mid day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0335.mp3|but also with the awfulness that is always imparted to familiar objects by an unaccustomed light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0337.mp3|the doorsteps and thresholds with the early grass springing up about them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0338.mp3|the garden plots black with freshly turned earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0339.mp3|the wheel track|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0340.mp3|little worn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0341.mp3|and even in the market place margined with green on either side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0342.mp3|all were visible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0343.mp3|but with a singularity of aspect that seemed to give another moral interpretation to the things of this world than they had ever borne before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0344.mp3|and there stood the minister with his hand over his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0345.mp3|and hester prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0346.mp3|with the embroidered letter glimmering on her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0348.mp3|herself a symbol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0349.mp3|and the connecting link between those two|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0350.mp3|they stood in the noon of that strange and solemn splendour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0351.mp3|as if it were the light that is to reveal all secrets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0352.mp3|and the daybreak that shall unite all who belong to one another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0353.mp3|there was witchcraft in little pearl's eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0355.mp3|as she glanced upward at the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0356.mp3|wore that naughty smile which made its expression frequently so elvish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0358.mp3|and pointed across the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0359.mp3|but he clasped both his hands over his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0360.mp3|and cast his eyes towards the zenith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0361.mp3|nothing was more common|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0362.mp3|in those days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0363.mp3|than to interpret all meteoric appearances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0364.mp3|and other natural phenomena that occurred with less regularity than the rise and set of sun and moon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0365.mp3|as so many revelations from a supernatural source|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0367.mp3|a blazing spear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0368.mp3|a sword of flame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0370.mp3|or a sheaf of arrows seen in the midnight sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0371.mp3|prefigured indian warfare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0372.mp3|pestilence was known to have been foreboded by a shower of crimson light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0373.mp3|we doubt whether any marked event|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0374.mp3|for good or evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0375.mp3|ever befell new england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0376.mp3|from its settlement down to revolutionary times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0378.mp3|not seldom it had been seen by multitudes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0381.mp3|its credibility rested on the faith of some lonely eye witness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0388.mp3|a majestic idea that the destiny of nations should be revealed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0389.mp3|in these awful hieroglyphics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0390.mp3|on the cope of heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0392.mp3|the belief was a favourite one with our forefathers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0393.mp3|as betokening that their infant commonwealth was under a celestial guardianship of peculiar intimacy and strictness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0395.mp3|when an individual discovers a revelation addressed to himself alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0396.mp3|on the same vast sheet of record|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0397.mp3|in such a case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0398.mp3|it could only be the symptom of a highly disordered mental state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0400.mp3|rendered morbidly self contemplative by long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0402.mp3|and secret pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0403.mp3|had extended his egotism over the whole expanse of nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0404.mp3|until the firmament itself should appear no more than a fitting page for his soul's history and fate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0407.mp3|solely to the disease in his own eye and heart that the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0408.mp3|looking upward to the zenith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0410.mp3|the letter a|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0411.mp3|marked out in lines of dull red light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0414.mp3|but with no such shape as his guilty imagination gave it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0417.mp3|with so little definiteness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0418.mp3|that another's guilt might have seen another symbol in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0420.mp3|all the time that he gazed upward to the zenith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0421.mp3|he was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0422.mp3|nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0424.mp3|who stood at no great distance from the scaffold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0425.mp3|the minister appeared to see him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0426.mp3|with the same glance that discerned the miraculous letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0428.mp3|the meteoric light imparted a new expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0429.mp3|or it might well be that the physician was not careful then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0430.mp3|as at all other times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0431.mp3|to hide the malevolence with which he looked upon his victim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0433.mp3|if the meteor kindled up the sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0434.mp3|and disclosed the earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0435.mp3|with an awfulness that admonished hester prynne and the clergyman of the day of judgment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0436.mp3|then might roger chillingworth have passed with them for the arch fiend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0437.mp3|standing there with a smile and scowl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0438.mp3|to claim his own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0439.mp3|so vivid was the expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0441.mp3|that it seemed still to remain painted on the darkness after the meteor had vanished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0442.mp3|with an effect as if the street and all things else were at once annihilated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0445.mp3|overcome with terror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0447.mp3|dost thou know the man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0448.mp3|i hate him hester she remembered her oath and was silent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0449.mp3|i tell thee my soul shivers at him muttered the minister again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0450.mp3|who is he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0451.mp3|who is he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0452.mp3|canst thou do nothing for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0453.mp3|i have a nameless horror of the man minister said little pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0456.mp3|child said the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0457.mp3|bending his ear close to her lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0458.mp3|quickly and as low as thou canst whisper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0461.mp3|like human language|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0466.mp3|and did but increase the bewilderment of his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0467.mp3|the elvish child then laughed aloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0468.mp3|dost thou mock me now said the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0469.mp3|thou wast not bold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0474.mp3|who had now advanced to the foot of the platform|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0475.mp3|pious master dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0476.mp3|can this be you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0478.mp3|we men of study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0479.mp3|whose heads are in our books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0481.mp3|we dream in our waking moments and walk in our sleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0489.mp3|i knew nothing of the matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0490.mp3|i had spent the better part of the night at the bedside of the worshipful governor winthrop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0491.mp3|doing what my poor skill might to give him ease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0493.mp3|going home to a better world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0495.mp3|was on my way homeward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0500.mp3|else you will be poorly able to do sabbath duty to morrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0502.mp3|see now how they trouble the brain these books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0503.mp3|these books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0506.mp3|and take a little pastime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0508.mp3|i will go home with you said mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0509.mp3|with a chill despondency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0512.mp3|from an ugly dream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0514.mp3|and was led away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0515.mp3|the next day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0517.mp3|being the sabbath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0518.mp3|he preached a discourse which was held to be the richest and most powerful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0519.mp3|and the most replete with heavenly influences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0520.mp3|that had ever proceeded from his lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0523.mp3|more souls than one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0524.mp3|were brought to the truth by the efficacy of that sermon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0525.mp3|and vowed within themselves to cherish a holy gratitude towards mister dimmesdale throughout the long hereafter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0526.mp3|but as he came down the pulpit steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0527.mp3|the grey bearded sexton met him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0528.mp3|holding up a black glove|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0530.mp3|it was found said the sexton|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0531.mp3|this morning on the scaffold where evil doers are set up to public shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0535.mp3|but indeed he was blind and foolish as he ever and always is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0537.mp3|my good friend said the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0539.mp3|but startled at heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0540.mp3|for so confused was his remembrance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0541.mp3|that he had almost brought himself to look at the events of the past night as visionary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0542.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0545.mp3|since satan saw fit to steal it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0546.mp3|your reverence must needs handle him without gloves henceforward remarked the old sexton|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0547.mp3|grimly smiling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0548.mp3|but did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0549.mp3|a great red letter in the sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0550.mp3|the letter a which we interpret to stand for angel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0552.mp3|as our good governor winthrop was made an angel this past night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0553.mp3|it was doubtless held fit that there should be some notice thereof no answered the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_12_hawthorne_0554.mp3|i had not heard of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0001.mp3|hester prynne was shocked at the condition to which she found the clergyman reduced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0002.mp3|his nerve seemed absolutely destroyed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0003.mp3|his moral force was abased into more than childish weakness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0004.mp3|it grovelled helpless on the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0005.mp3|even while his intellectual faculties retained their pristine strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0006.mp3|or had perhaps acquired a morbid energy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0007.mp3|which disease only could have given them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0008.mp3|with her knowledge of a train of circumstances hidden from all others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0010.mp3|besides the legitimate action of his own conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0011.mp3|a terrible machinery had been brought to bear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0012.mp3|and was still operating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0013.mp3|on mister dimmesdale's well being and repose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0014.mp3|knowing what this poor fallen man had once been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0016.mp3|the outcast woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0017.mp3|for support against his instinctively discovered enemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0018.mp3|she decided moreover that he had a right to her utmost aid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0019.mp3|little accustomed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0020.mp3|in her long seclusion from society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0023.mp3|or seemed to see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0024.mp3|that there lay a responsibility upon her in reference to the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0026.mp3|nor to the whole world besides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0028.mp3|links of flowers or silk or gold or whatever the material|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0029.mp3|had all been broken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0030.mp3|here was the iron link of mutual crime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0031.mp3|which neither he nor she could break|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0032.mp3|like all other ties it brought along with it its obligations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0033.mp3|hester prynne did not now occupy precisely the same position in which we beheld her during the earlier periods of her ignominy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0034.mp3|years had come and gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0035.mp3|pearl was now seven years old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0037.mp3|with the scarlet letter on her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0038.mp3|glittering in its fantastic embroidery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0039.mp3|had long been a familiar object to the townspeople|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0040.mp3|as is apt to be the case when a person stands out in any prominence before the community|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0042.mp3|at the same time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0045.mp3|it is to the credit of human nature that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0046.mp3|except where its selfishness is brought into play|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0047.mp3|it loves more readily than it hates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0049.mp3|by a gradual and quiet process|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0050.mp3|will even be transformed to love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0051.mp3|unless the change be impeded by a continually new irritation of the original feeling of hostility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0053.mp3|she never battled with the public|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0054.mp3|but submitted uncomplainingly to its worst usage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0055.mp3|she made no claim upon it in requital for what she suffered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0056.mp3|she did not weigh upon its sympathies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0058.mp3|also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0059.mp3|the blameless purity of her life during all these years in which she had been set apart to infamy was reckoned largely in her favour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0060.mp3|with nothing now to lose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0061.mp3|in the sight of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0062.mp3|and with no hope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0066.mp3|it was perceived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0068.mp3|that while hester never put forward even the humblest title to share in the world's privileges|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0070.mp3|she was quick to acknowledge her sisterhood with the race of man whenever benefits were to be conferred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0071.mp3|none so ready as she to give of her little substance to every demand of poverty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0072.mp3|even though the bitter hearted pauper threw back a gibe in requital of the food brought regularly to his door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0073.mp3|or the garments wrought for him by the fingers that could have embroidered a monarch's robe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0074.mp3|none so self devoted as hester when pestilence stalked through the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0077.mp3|whether general or of individuals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0078.mp3|the outcast of society at once found her place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0079.mp3|she came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0080.mp3|not as a guest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0081.mp3|but as a rightful inmate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0082.mp3|into the household that was darkened by trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0084.mp3|there glimmered the embroidered letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0085.mp3|with comfort in its unearthly ray|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0086.mp3|elsewhere the token of sin it was the taper of the sick chamber|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0087.mp3|it had even thrown its gleam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0088.mp3|in the sufferer's hard extremity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0089.mp3|across the verge of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0090.mp3|it had shown him where to set his foot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0091.mp3|while the light of earth was fast becoming dim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0092.mp3|and ere the light of futurity could reach him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0093.mp3|in such emergencies hester's nature showed itself warm and rich|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0094.mp3|a well spring of human tenderness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0095.mp3|unfailing to every real demand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0096.mp3|and inexhaustible by the largest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0097.mp3|her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0098.mp3|with its badge of shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0099.mp3|was but the softer pillow for the head that needed one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0100.mp3|she was self ordained a sister of mercy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0102.mp3|we may rather say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0103.mp3|the world's heavy hand had so ordained her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0104.mp3|when neither the world nor she looked forward to this result|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0105.mp3|the letter was the symbol of her calling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0106.mp3|such helpfulness was found in her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0108.mp3|that many people refused to interpret the scarlet a by its original signification|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0110.mp3|so strong was hester prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0111.mp3|with a woman's strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0112.mp3|it was only the darkened house that could contain her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0113.mp3|when sunshine came again she was not there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0114.mp3|her shadow had faded across the threshold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0115.mp3|the helpful inmate had departed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0116.mp3|without one backward glance to gather up the meed of gratitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0117.mp3|if any were in the hearts of those whom she had served so zealously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0118.mp3|meeting them in the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0119.mp3|she never raised her head to receive their greeting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0120.mp3|if they were resolute to accost her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0121.mp3|she laid her finger on the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0122.mp3|and passed on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0123.mp3|this might be pride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0124.mp3|but was so like humility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0125.mp3|that it produced all the softening influence of the latter quality on the public mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0126.mp3|the public is despotic in its temper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0127.mp3|it is capable of denying common justice when too strenuously demanded as a right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0128.mp3|but quite as frequently it awards more than justice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0129.mp3|when the appeal is made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0130.mp3|as despots love to have it made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0131.mp3|entirely to its generosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0132.mp3|interpreting hester prynne's deportment as an appeal of this nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0136.mp3|than she deserved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0138.mp3|and the wise and learned men of the community|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0139.mp3|were longer in acknowledging the influence of hester's good qualities than the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0141.mp3|that made it a far tougher labour to expel them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0143.mp3|nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0144.mp3|their sour and rigid wrinkles were relaxing into something which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0145.mp3|in the due course of years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0146.mp3|might grow to be an expression of almost benevolence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0147.mp3|thus it was with the men of rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0148.mp3|on whom their eminent position imposed the guardianship of the public morals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0151.mp3|had quite forgiven hester prynne for her frailty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0154.mp3|they had begun to look upon the scarlet letter as the token|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0155.mp3|not of that one sin for which she had borne so long and dreary a penance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0156.mp3|but of her many good deeds since|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0157.mp3|do you see that woman with the embroidered badge they would say to strangers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0158.mp3|it is our hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0159.mp3|the town's own hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0160.mp3|who is so kind to the poor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0161.mp3|so helpful to the sick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0162.mp3|so comfortable to the afflicted then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0163.mp3|it is true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0164.mp3|the propensity of human nature to tell the very worst of itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0165.mp3|when embodied in the person of another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0166.mp3|would constrain them to whisper the black scandal of bygone years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0167.mp3|it was none the less a fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0169.mp3|that in the eyes of the very men who spoke thus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0171.mp3|it imparted to the wearer a kind of sacredness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0172.mp3|which enabled her to walk securely amid all peril|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0173.mp3|had she fallen among thieves it would have kept her safe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0174.mp3|it was reported|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0175.mp3|and believed by many|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0176.mp3|that an indian had drawn his arrow against the badge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0177.mp3|and that the missile struck it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0179.mp3|the effect of the symbol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0181.mp3|of the position in respect to society that was indicated by it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0182.mp3|on the mind of hester prynne herself was powerful and peculiar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0183.mp3|all the light and graceful foliage of her character had been withered up by this red hot brand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0184.mp3|and had long ago fallen away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0185.mp3|leaving a bare and harsh outline|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0186.mp3|which might have been repulsive had she possessed friends or companions to be repelled by it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0187.mp3|even the attractiveness of her person had undergone a similar change|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0188.mp3|it might be partly owing to the studied austerity of her dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0189.mp3|and partly to the lack of demonstration in her manners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0190.mp3|it was a sad transformation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0192.mp3|that her rich and luxuriant hair had either been cut off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0193.mp3|or was so completely hidden by a cap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0194.mp3|that not a shining lock of it ever once gushed into the sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0195.mp3|it was due in part to all these causes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0196.mp3|but still more to something else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0197.mp3|that there seemed to be no longer anything in hester's face for love to dwell upon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0198.mp3|nothing in hester's form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0199.mp3|though majestic and statue like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0200.mp3|that passion would ever dream of clasping in its embrace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0201.mp3|nothing in hester's bosom to make it ever again the pillow of affection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0202.mp3|some attribute had departed from her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0203.mp3|the permanence of which had been essential to keep her a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0204.mp3|such is frequently the fate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0205.mp3|and such the stern development|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0206.mp3|of the feminine character and person|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0208.mp3|and lived through|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0209.mp3|an experience of peculiar severity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0210.mp3|if she be all tenderness she will die|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0211.mp3|if she survive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0212.mp3|the tenderness will either be crushed out of her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0214.mp3|and the outward semblance is the same|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0215.mp3|crushed so deeply into her heart that it can never show itself more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0216.mp3|the latter is perhaps the truest theory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0218.mp3|and ceased to be so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0219.mp3|might at any moment become a woman again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0220.mp3|if there were only the magic touch to effect the transformation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0222.mp3|much of the marble coldness of hester's impression was to be attributed to the circumstance that her life had turned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0223.mp3|in a great measure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0224.mp3|from passion and feeling to thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0225.mp3|standing alone in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0230.mp3|and hopeless of retrieving her position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0231.mp3|even had she not scorned to consider it desirable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0233.mp3|the world's law was no law for her mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0234.mp3|it was an age in which the human intellect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0235.mp3|newly emancipated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0237.mp3|men of the sword had overthrown nobles and kings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0238.mp3|men bolder than these had overthrown and rearranged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0239.mp3|not actually|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0240.mp3|but within the sphere of theory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0241.mp3|which was their most real abode|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0242.mp3|the whole system of ancient prejudice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0243.mp3|wherewith was linked much of ancient principle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0245.mp3|she assumed a freedom of speculation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0246.mp3|then common enough on the other side of the atlantic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0247.mp3|but which our forefathers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0250.mp3|in her lonesome cottage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0251.mp3|by the seashore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0252.mp3|thoughts visited her such as dared to enter no other dwelling in new england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0253.mp3|shadowy guests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0254.mp3|that would have been as perilous as demons to their entertainer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0255.mp3|could they have been seen so much as knocking at her door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0256.mp3|it is remarkable that persons who speculate the most boldly often conform with the most perfect quietude to the external regulations of society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0257.mp3|the thought suffices them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0258.mp3|without investing itself in the flesh and blood of action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0259.mp3|so it seemed to be with hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0262.mp3|it might have been far otherwise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0263.mp3|then she might have come down to us in history|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0265.mp3|as the foundress of a religious sect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0266.mp3|she might in one of her phases have been a prophetess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0268.mp3|and not improbably would|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0269.mp3|have suffered death from the stern tribunals of the period|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0270.mp3|for attempting to undermine the foundations of the puritan establishment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0272.mp3|in the education of her child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0273.mp3|the mother's enthusiasm of thought had something to wreak itself upon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0275.mp3|in the person of this little girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0276.mp3|had assigned to hester's charge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0277.mp3|the germ and blossom of womanhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0278.mp3|to be cherished and developed amid a host of difficulties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0279.mp3|everything was against her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0280.mp3|the world was hostile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0281.mp3|the child's own nature had something wrong in it which continually betokened that she had been born amiss|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0283.mp3|and often impelled hester to ask|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0284.mp3|in bitterness of heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0287.mp3|the same dark question often rose into her mind with reference to the whole race of womanhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0288.mp3|was existence worth accepting even to the happiest among them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0289.mp3|as concerned her own individual existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0290.mp3|she had long ago decided in the negative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0291.mp3|and dismissed the point as settled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0292.mp3|a tendency to speculation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0294.mp3|as it does man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0295.mp3|yet makes her sad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0296.mp3|she discerns it may be such a hopeless task before her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0297.mp3|as a first step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0298.mp3|the whole system of society is to be torn down and built up anew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0299.mp3|then the very nature of the opposite sex|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0300.mp3|or its long hereditary habit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0301.mp3|which has become like nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0302.mp3|is to be essentially modified before woman can be allowed to assume what seems a fair and suitable position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0303.mp3|finally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0304.mp3|all other difficulties being obviated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0305.mp3|woman cannot take advantage of these preliminary reforms until she herself shall have undergone a still mightier change|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0306.mp3|in which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0308.mp3|the ethereal essence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0309.mp3|wherein she has her truest life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0310.mp3|will be found to have evaporated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0311.mp3|a woman never overcomes these problems by any exercise of thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0312.mp3|they are not to be solved or only in one way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0314.mp3|thus hester prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0315.mp3|whose heart had lost its regular and healthy throb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0317.mp3|now turned aside by an insurmountable precipice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0318.mp3|now starting back from a deep chasm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0319.mp3|there was wild and ghastly scenery all around her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0320.mp3|and a home and comfort nowhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0321.mp3|at times a fearful doubt strove to possess her soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0322.mp3|whether it were not better to send pearl at once to heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0323.mp3|and go herself to such futurity as eternal justice should provide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0324.mp3|the scarlet letter had not done its office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0327.mp3|her interview with the reverend mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0328.mp3|on the night of his vigil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0329.mp3|had given her a new theme of reflection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0330.mp3|and held up to her an object that appeared worthy of any exertion and sacrifice for its attainment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0331.mp3|she had witnessed the intense misery beneath which the minister struggled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0333.mp3|to speak more accurately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0334.mp3|had ceased to struggle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0335.mp3|she saw that he stood on the verge of lunacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0336.mp3|if he had not already stepped across it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0337.mp3|it was impossible to doubt that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0338.mp3|whatever painful efficacy there might be in the secret sting of remorse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0339.mp3|a deadlier venom had been infused into it by the hand that proffered relief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0340.mp3|a secret enemy had been continually by his side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0342.mp3|and had availed himself of the opportunities thus afforded for tampering with the delicate springs of mister dimmesdale's nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0345.mp3|and loyalty on her own part|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0346.mp3|in allowing the minister to be thrown into a position where so much evil was to be foreboded and nothing auspicious to be hoped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0347.mp3|her only justification lay in the fact that she had been able to discern no method of rescuing him from a blacker ruin than had overwhelmed herself except by acquiescing in roger chillingworth's scheme of disguise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0348.mp3|under that impulse she had made her choice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0349.mp3|and had chosen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0350.mp3|as it now appeared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0351.mp3|the more wretched alternative of the two|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0352.mp3|she determined to redeem her error so far as it might yet be possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0353.mp3|strengthened by years of hard and solemn trial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0354.mp3|she felt herself no longer so inadequate to cope with roger chillingworth as on that night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0355.mp3|abased by sin and half maddened by the ignominy that was still new|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0356.mp3|when they had talked together in the prison chamber|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0357.mp3|she had climbed her way since then to a higher point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0360.mp3|had brought himself nearer to her level|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0364.mp3|by the revenge which he had stooped for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0368.mp3|the occasion was not long to seek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0369.mp3|one afternoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0370.mp3|walking with pearl in a retired part of the peninsula|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_13_hawthorne_0371.mp3|she beheld the old physician with a basket on one arm and a staff in the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0002.mp3|until she should have talked awhile with yonder gatherer of herbs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0003.mp3|so the child flew away like a bird|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0004.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0005.mp3|making bare her small white feet went pattering along the moist margin of the sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0006.mp3|here and there she came to a full stop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0007.mp3|and peeped curiously into a pool|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0008.mp3|left by the retiring tide as a mirror for pearl to see her face in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0010.mp3|out of the pool|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0011.mp3|with dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0012.mp3|glistening curls around her head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0013.mp3|and an elf smile in her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0015.mp3|having no other playmate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0016.mp3|invited to take her hand and run a race with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0017.mp3|but the visionary little maid on her part|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0018.mp3|beckoned likewise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0019.mp3|as if to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0020.mp3|this is a better place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0021.mp3|come thou into the pool|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0023.mp3|stepping in mid leg deep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0024.mp3|beheld her own white feet at the bottom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0026.mp3|out of a still lower depth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0027.mp3|came the gleam of a kind of fragmentary smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0028.mp3|floating to and fro in the agitated water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0029.mp3|meanwhile her mother had accosted the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0030.mp3|i would speak a word with you said she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0031.mp3|a word that concerns us much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0033.mp3|and is it mistress hester that has a word for old roger chillingworth answered he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0034.mp3|raising himself from his stooping posture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0035.mp3|with all my heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0036.mp3|why mistress i hear good tidings of you on all hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0038.mp3|a magistrate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0039.mp3|a wise and godly man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0040.mp3|was discoursing of your affairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0041.mp3|mistress hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0042.mp3|and whispered me that there had been question concerning you in the council|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0043.mp3|it was debated whether or no|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0046.mp3|on my life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0050.mp3|were i worthy to be quit of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0051.mp3|it would fall away of its own nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0056.mp3|if it suit you better rejoined he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0057.mp3|a woman must needs follow her own fancy touching the adornment of her person|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0059.mp3|and shows right bravely on your bosom all this while hester had been looking steadily at the old man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0060.mp3|and was shocked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0061.mp3|as well as wonder smitten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0062.mp3|to discern what a change had been wrought upon him within the past seven years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0063.mp3|it was not so much that he had grown older|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0064.mp3|for though the traces of advancing life were visible he bore his age well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0065.mp3|and seemed to retain a wiry vigour and alertness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0066.mp3|but the former aspect of an intellectual and studious man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0067.mp3|calm and quiet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0068.mp3|which was what she best remembered in him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0069.mp3|had altogether vanished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0070.mp3|and been succeeded by an eager|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0072.mp3|almost fierce|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0073.mp3|yet carefully guarded look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0074.mp3|it seemed to be his wish and purpose to mask this expression with a smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0075.mp3|but the latter played him false|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0076.mp3|and flickered over his visage so derisively that the spectator could see his blackness all the better for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0080.mp3|as if the old man's soul were on fire and kept on smouldering duskily within his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0081.mp3|until by some casual puff of passion it was blown into a momentary flame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0082.mp3|this he repressed as speedily as possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0083.mp3|and strove to look as if nothing of the kind had happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0087.mp3|for a reasonable space of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0088.mp3|undertake a devil's office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0090.mp3|and deriving his enjoyment thence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0093.mp3|here was another ruin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0094.mp3|the responsibility of which came partly home to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0095.mp3|what see you in my face asked the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0096.mp3|that you look at it so earnestly something that would make me weep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0097.mp3|if there were any tears bitter enough for it answered she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0098.mp3|but let it pass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0099.mp3|it is of yonder miserable man that i would speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0102.mp3|as if he loved the topic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0103.mp3|and were glad of an opportunity to discuss it with the only person of whom he could make a confidant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0104.mp3|not to hide the truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0107.mp3|so speak freely and i will make answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0108.mp3|when we last spake together said hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0109.mp3|now seven years ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0110.mp3|it was your pleasure to extort a promise of secrecy as touching the former relation betwixt yourself and me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0111.mp3|as the life and good fame of yonder man were in your hands there seemed no choice to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0112.mp3|save to be silent in accordance with your behest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0113.mp3|yet it was not without heavy misgivings that i thus bound myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0116.mp3|there remained a duty towards him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0117.mp3|and something whispered me that i was betraying it in pledging myself to keep your counsel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0118.mp3|since that day no man is so near to him as you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0119.mp3|you tread behind his every footstep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0122.mp3|you burrow and rankle in his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0123.mp3|your clutch is on his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0124.mp3|and you cause him to die daily a living death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0125.mp3|and still he knows you not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0128.mp3|pointed at this man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0129.mp3|would have hurled him from his pulpit into a dungeon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0133.mp3|what evil have i done the man asked roger chillingworth again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0136.mp3|the richest fee that ever physician earned from monarch could not have bought such care as i have wasted on this miserable priest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0137.mp3|but for my aid his life would have burned away in torments within the first two years after the perpetration of his crime and thine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0141.mp3|as thine has|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0142.mp3|beneath a burden like thy scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0143.mp3|oh i could reveal a goodly secret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0145.mp3|what art can do i have exhausted on him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0150.mp3|letting the lurid fire of his heart blaze out before her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0151.mp3|better had he died at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0152.mp3|never did mortal suffer what this man has suffered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0153.mp3|and all all in the sight of his worst enemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0154.mp3|he has been conscious of me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0155.mp3|he has felt an influence dwelling always upon him like a curse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0156.mp3|he knew by some spiritual sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0157.mp3|for the creator never made another being so sensitive as this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0159.mp3|and that an eye was looking curiously into him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0160.mp3|which sought only evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0161.mp3|and found it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0162.mp3|but he knew not that the eye and hand were mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0163.mp3|with the superstition common to his brotherhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0164.mp3|he fancied himself given over to a fiend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0165.mp3|to be tortured with frightful dreams and desperate thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0166.mp3|the sting of remorse and despair of pardon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0167.mp3|as a foretaste of what awaits him beyond the grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0168.mp3|but it was the constant shadow of my presence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0169.mp3|the closest propinquity of the man whom he had most vilely wronged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0170.mp3|and who had grown to exist only by this perpetual poison of the direst revenge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0172.mp3|a mortal man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0173.mp3|with once a human heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0174.mp3|has become a fiend for his especial torment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0175.mp3|the unfortunate physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0176.mp3|while uttering these words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0177.mp3|lifted his hands with a look of horror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0178.mp3|as if he had beheld some frightful shape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0180.mp3|usurping the place of his own image in a glass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0181.mp3|it was one of those moments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0182.mp3|which sometimes occur only at the interval of years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0183.mp3|when a man's moral aspect is faithfully revealed to his mind's eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0184.mp3|not improbably he had never before viewed himself as he did now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0186.mp3|noticing the old man's look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0187.mp3|has he not paid thee all no no|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0188.mp3|he has but increased the debt answered the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0191.mp3|and subsided into gloom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0192.mp3|dost thou remember me hester as i was nine years agone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0193.mp3|even then i was in the autumn of my days nor was it the early autumn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0195.mp3|studious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0196.mp3|thoughtful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0197.mp3|quiet years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0198.mp3|bestowed faithfully for the increase of mine own knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0201.mp3|though this latter object was but casual to the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0202.mp3|faithfully for the advancement of human welfare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0203.mp3|no life had been more peaceful and innocent than mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0204.mp3|few lives so rich with benefits conferred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0205.mp3|dost thou remember me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0207.mp3|though you might deem me cold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0208.mp3|nevertheless a man thoughtful for others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0209.mp3|craving little for himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0210.mp3|kind true just and of constant if not warm affections|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0211.mp3|was i not all this all this and more said hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0212.mp3|and what am i now demanded he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0213.mp3|looking into her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0214.mp3|and permitting the whole evil within him to be written on his features|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0215.mp3|i have already told thee what i am a fiend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0216.mp3|who made me so it was myself cried hester shuddering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0217.mp3|it was i not less than he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0218.mp3|why hast thou not avenged thyself on me i have left thee to the scarlet letter replied roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0220.mp3|i can do no more he laid his finger on it with a smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0222.mp3|i judged no less said the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0225.mp3|he must discern thee in thy true character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0226.mp3|what may be the result i know not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0227.mp3|but this long debt of confidence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0229.mp3|whose bane and ruin i have been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0230.mp3|shall at length be paid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0231.mp3|so far as concerns the overthrow or preservation of his fair fame and his earthly state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0232.mp3|and perchance his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0236.mp3|though it be the truth of red hot iron entering into the soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0237.mp3|nor do i perceive such advantage in his living any longer a life of ghastly emptiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0238.mp3|that i shall stoop to implore thy mercy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0239.mp3|do with him as thou wilt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0240.mp3|there is no good for him no good for me no good for thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0241.mp3|there is no good for little pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0242.mp3|there is no path to guide us out of this dismal maze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0244.mp3|i could well nigh pity thee said roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0245.mp3|unable to restrain a thrill of admiration too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0246.mp3|for there was a quality almost majestic in the despair which she expressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0247.mp3|thou hadst great elements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0250.mp3|this evil had not been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0251.mp3|i pity thee for the good that has been wasted in thy nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0253.mp3|for the hatred that has transformed a wise and just man to a fiend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0254.mp3|wilt thou yet purge it out of thee and be once more human|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0256.mp3|forgive and leave his further retribution to the power that claims it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0257.mp3|i said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0258.mp3|but now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0259.mp3|that there could be no good event for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0263.mp3|and stumbling at every step over the guilt wherewith we have strewn our path|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0264.mp3|it is not so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0265.mp3|there might be good for thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0266.mp3|and thee alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0268.mp3|wilt thou give up that only privilege|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0270.mp3|peace replied the old man with gloomy sternness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0271.mp3|it is not granted me to pardon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0272.mp3|i have no such power as thou tellest me of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0273.mp3|my old faith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0274.mp3|long forgotten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0275.mp3|comes back to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0276.mp3|and explains all that we do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0277.mp3|and all we suffer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0279.mp3|but since that moment it has all been a dark necessity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0280.mp3|ye that have wronged me are not sinful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0281.mp3|save in a kind of typical illusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0283.mp3|who have snatched a fiend's office from his hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0284.mp3|it is our fate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0285.mp3|let the black flower blossom as it may|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0287.mp3|he waved his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_14_hawthorne_0288.mp3|and betook himself again to his employment of gathering herbs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0001.mp3|a deformed old figure with a face that haunted men's memories longer than they liked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0002.mp3|took leave of hester prynne and went stooping away along the earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0003.mp3|he gathered here and there a herb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0004.mp3|or grubbed up a root and put it into the basket on his arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0005.mp3|his gray beard almost touched the ground as he crept onward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0006.mp3|hester gazed after him a little while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0007.mp3|looking with a half fantastic curiosity to see whether the tender grass of early spring would not be blighted beneath him and show the wavering track of his footsteps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0009.mp3|across its cheerful verdure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0010.mp3|she wondered what sort of herbs they were which the old man was so sedulous to gather|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0011.mp3|would not the earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0012.mp3|quickened to an evil purpose by the sympathy of his eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0014.mp3|that would start up under his fingers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0017.mp3|which shone so brightly everywhere else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0018.mp3|really fall upon him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0020.mp3|as it rather seemed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0021.mp3|a circle of ominous shadow moving along with his deformity whichever way he turned himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0022.mp3|and whither was he now going|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0023.mp3|would he not suddenly sink into the earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0024.mp3|leaving a barren and blasted spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0026.mp3|in due course of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0030.mp3|and whatever else of vegetable wickedness the climate could produce|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0033.mp3|looking so much the uglier the higher he rose towards heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0036.mp3|as still she gazed after him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0037.mp3|i hate the man she upbraided herself for the sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0038.mp3|but could not overcome or lessen it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0039.mp3|attempting to do so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0040.mp3|she thought of those long past days in a distant land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0041.mp3|when he used to emerge at eventide from the seclusion of his study and sit down in the firelight of their home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0042.mp3|and in the light of her nuptial smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0043.mp3|he needed to bask himself in that smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0044.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0045.mp3|in order that the chill of so many lonely hours among his books might be taken off the scholar's heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0046.mp3|such scenes had once appeared not otherwise than happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0047.mp3|but now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0048.mp3|as viewed through the dismal medium of her subsequent life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0050.mp3|she marvelled how such scenes could have been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0051.mp3|she marvelled how she could ever have been wrought upon to marry him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0052.mp3|she deemed it her crime most to be repented of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0053.mp3|that she had ever endured and reciprocated the lukewarm grasp of his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0054.mp3|and had suffered the smile of her lips and eyes to mingle and melt into his own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0057.mp3|in the time when her heart knew no better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0058.mp3|he had persuaded her to fancy herself happy by his side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0059.mp3|yes i hate him repeated hester more bitterly than before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0060.mp3|he betrayed me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0062.mp3|unless they win along with it the utmost passion of her heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0063.mp3|else it may be their miserable fortune|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0065.mp3|when some mightier touch than their own may have awakened all her sensibilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0066.mp3|to be reproached even for the calm content|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0067.mp3|the marble image of happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0069.mp3|but hester ought long ago to have done with this injustice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0070.mp3|what did it betoken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0071.mp3|had seven long years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0072.mp3|under the torture of the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0073.mp3|inflicted so much of misery and wrought out no repentance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0075.mp3|while she stood gazing after the crooked figure of old roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0076.mp3|threw a dark light on hester's state of mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0077.mp3|revealing much that she might not otherwise have acknowledged to herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0078.mp3|he being gone she summoned back her child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0081.mp3|where are you pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0082.mp3|whose activity of spirit never flagged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0083.mp3|had been at no loss for amusement while her mother talked with the old gatherer of herbs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0084.mp3|at first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0085.mp3|as already told|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0086.mp3|she had flirted fancifully with her own image in a pool of water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0087.mp3|beckoning the phantom forth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0090.mp3|seeking a passage for herself into its sphere of impalpable earth and unattainable sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0093.mp3|that either she or the image was unreal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0094.mp3|she turned elsewhere for better pastime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0097.mp3|and sent out more ventures on the mighty deep than any merchant in new england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0100.mp3|and made prize of several five fingers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0102.mp3|then she took up the white foam that streaked the line of the advancing tide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0103.mp3|and threw it upon the breeze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0106.mp3|the naughty child picked up her apron full of pebbles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0109.mp3|displayed remarkable dexterity in pelting them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0111.mp3|with a white breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0112.mp3|pearl was almost sure had been hit by a pebble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0113.mp3|and fluttered away with a broken wing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0114.mp3|but then the elf child sighed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0115.mp3|and gave up her sport|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0117.mp3|or as wild as pearl herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0118.mp3|her final employment was to gather seaweed of various kinds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0119.mp3|and make herself a scarf or mantle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0120.mp3|and a head dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0121.mp3|and thus assume the aspect of a little mermaid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0122.mp3|she inherited her mother's gift for devising drapery and costume|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0123.mp3|as the last touch to her mermaid's garb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0124.mp3|pearl took some eel grass and imitated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0125.mp3|as best she could|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0126.mp3|on her own bosom the decoration with which she was so familiar on her mother's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0127.mp3|a letter the letter a but freshly green instead of scarlet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0128.mp3|the child bent her chin upon her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0129.mp3|and contemplated this device with strange interest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0130.mp3|even as if the one only thing for which she had been sent into the world was to make out its hidden import|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0131.mp3|i wonder if mother will ask me what it means thought pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0132.mp3|just then she heard her mother's voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0135.mp3|appeared before hester prynne dancing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0137.mp3|and pointing her finger to the ornament upon her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0139.mp3|after a moment's silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0140.mp3|the green letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0146.mp3|mother said the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0149.mp3|but though there was that singular expression which she had so often remarked in her black eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0151.mp3|she felt a morbid desire to ascertain the point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0154.mp3|wherefore thy mother wears this letter truly do i answered pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0155.mp3|looking brightly into her mother's face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0156.mp3|it is for the same reason that the minister keeps his hand over his heart and what reason is that asked hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0157.mp3|half smiling at the absurd incongruity of the child's observation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0158.mp3|but on second thoughts turning pale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0161.mp3|i have told all i know said pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0162.mp3|more seriously than she was wont to speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0163.mp3|ask yonder old man whom thou hast been talking with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0164.mp3|it may be he can tell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0167.mp3|what does this scarlet letter mean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0168.mp3|and why dost thou wear it on thy bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0169.mp3|and why does the minister keep his hand over his heart she took her mother's hand in both her own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0170.mp3|and gazed into her eyes with an earnestness that was seldom seen in her wild and capricious character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0171.mp3|the thought occurred to hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0173.mp3|and doing what she could|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0174.mp3|and as intelligently as she knew how|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0175.mp3|to establish a meeting point of sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0176.mp3|it showed pearl in an unwonted aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0178.mp3|the mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0179.mp3|while loving her child with the intensity of a sole affection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0180.mp3|had schooled herself to hope for little other return than the waywardness of an april breeze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0181.mp3|which spends its time in airy sport|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0182.mp3|and has its gusts of inexplicable passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0183.mp3|and is petulant in its best of moods|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0184.mp3|and chills oftener than caresses you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0185.mp3|when you take it to your bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0187.mp3|of its own vague purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0188.mp3|kiss your cheek with a kind of doubtful tenderness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0189.mp3|and play gently with your hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0191.mp3|leaving a dreamy pleasure at your heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0192.mp3|and this moreover was a mother's estimate of the child's disposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0193.mp3|any other observer might have seen few but unamiable traits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0194.mp3|and have given them a far darker colouring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0195.mp3|but now the idea came strongly into hester's mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0197.mp3|with her remarkable precocity and acuteness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0201.mp3|in the little chaos of pearl's character there might be seen emerging and could have been from the very first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0202.mp3|the steadfast principles of an unflinching courage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0203.mp3|an uncontrollable will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0204.mp3|sturdy pride which might be disciplined into self respect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0205.mp3|and a bitter scorn of many things which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0206.mp3|when examined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0207.mp3|might be found to have the taint of falsehood in them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0208.mp3|she possessed affections|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0212.mp3|with all these sterling attributes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0213.mp3|thought hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0214.mp3|the evil which she inherited from her mother must be great indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0215.mp3|if a noble woman do not grow out of this elfish child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0216.mp3|pearl's inevitable tendency to hover about the enigma of the scarlet letter seemed an innate quality of her being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0217.mp3|from the earliest epoch of her conscious life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0218.mp3|she had entered upon this as her appointed mission|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0219.mp3|hester had often fancied that providence had a design of justice and retribution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0220.mp3|in endowing the child with this marked propensity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0221.mp3|but never|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0222.mp3|until now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0223.mp3|had she bethought herself to ask|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0225.mp3|linked with that design|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0226.mp3|there might not likewise be a purpose of mercy and beneficence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0227.mp3|if little pearl were entertained with faith and trust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0228.mp3|as a spirit messenger no less than an earthly child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0229.mp3|might it not be her errand to soothe away the sorrow that lay cold in her mother's heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0230.mp3|and converted it into a tomb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0231.mp3|and to help her to overcome the passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0232.mp3|once so wild|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0233.mp3|and even yet neither dead nor asleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0234.mp3|but only imprisoned within the same tomb like heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0235.mp3|such were some of the thoughts that now stirred in hester's mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0236.mp3|with as much vivacity of impression as if they had actually been whispered into her ear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0238.mp3|all this while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0239.mp3|holding her mother's hand in both her own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0240.mp3|and turning her face upward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0241.mp3|while she put these searching questions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0242.mp3|once and again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0243.mp3|and still a third time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0244.mp3|what does the letter mean mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0245.mp3|and why dost thou wear it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0248.mp3|if this be the price of the child's sympathy i cannot pay it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0249.mp3|then she spoke aloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0250.mp3|silly pearl said she what questions are these|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0251.mp3|there are many things in this world that a child must not ask about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0252.mp3|what know i of the minister's heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0253.mp3|and as for the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0254.mp3|i wear it for the sake of its gold thread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0255.mp3|in all the seven bygone years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0256.mp3|hester prynne had never before been false to the symbol on her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0257.mp3|it may be that it was the talisman of a stern and severe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0258.mp3|but yet a guardian spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0259.mp3|who now forsook her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0261.mp3|in spite of his strict watch over her heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0262.mp3|some new evil had crept into it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0263.mp3|or some old one had never been expelled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0264.mp3|as for little pearl the earnestness soon passed out of her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0265.mp3|but the child did not see fit to let the matter drop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0266.mp3|two or three times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0267.mp3|as her mother and she went homeward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0269.mp3|and while hester was putting her to bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0270.mp3|and once after she seemed to be fairly asleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0272.mp3|with mischief gleaming in her black eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0273.mp3|mother said she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0274.mp3|what does the scarlet letter mean and the next morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0277.mp3|which she had so unaccountably connected with her investigations about the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0279.mp3|mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_15_hawthorne_0281.mp3|naughty child answered her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0001.mp3|at whatever risk of present pain or ulterior consequences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0002.mp3|the true character of the man who had crept into his intimacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0005.mp3|she vainly sought an opportunity of addressing him in some of the meditative walks which she knew him to be in the habit of taking along the shores of the peninsula|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0006.mp3|or on the wooded hills of the neighbouring country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0009.mp3|nor peril to the holy whiteness of the clergyman's good fame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0010.mp3|had she visited him in his own study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0011.mp3|where many a penitent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0014.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0015.mp3|partly that she dreaded the secret or undisguised interference of old roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0018.mp3|while they talked together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0019.mp3|for all these reasons hester never thought of meeting him in any narrower privacy than beneath the open sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0021.mp3|mister dimmesdale had been summoned to make a prayer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0023.mp3|the day before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0025.mp3|among his indian converts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0026.mp3|he would probably return by a certain hour in the afternoon of the morrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0028.mp3|who was necessarily the companion of all her mother's expeditions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0029.mp3|however inconvenient her presence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0030.mp3|and set forth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0031.mp3|the road|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0034.mp3|it straggled onward into the mystery of the primeval forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0035.mp3|this hemmed it in so narrowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0036.mp3|and stood so black and dense on either side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0037.mp3|and disclosed such imperfect glimpses of the sky above|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0039.mp3|to hester's mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0040.mp3|it imaged not amiss the moral wilderness in which she had so long been wandering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0046.mp3|so that a gleam of flickering sunshine might now and then be seen at its solitary play along the path|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0048.mp3|the sportive sunlight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0051.mp3|in the predominant pensiveness of the day and scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0052.mp3|withdrew itself as they came nigh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0053.mp3|and left the spots where it had danced the drearier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0054.mp3|because they had hoped to find them bright|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0055.mp3|mother said little pearl the sunshine does not love you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0058.mp3|now see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0059.mp3|there it is playing a good way off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0060.mp3|stand you here and let me run and catch it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0061.mp3|i am but a child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0065.mp3|i hope said hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0067.mp3|mother asked pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0069.mp3|just at the beginning of her race|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0071.mp3|child answered her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0072.mp3|and catch the sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0073.mp3|it will soon be gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0074.mp3|pearl set forth at a great pace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0075.mp3|and as hester smiled to perceive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0076.mp3|did actually catch the sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0077.mp3|and stood laughing in the midst of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0080.mp3|the light lingered about the lonely child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0081.mp3|as if glad of such a playmate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0082.mp3|until her mother had drawn almost nigh enough to step into the magic circle too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0083.mp3|it will go now said pearl shaking her head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0084.mp3|see answered hester smiling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0085.mp3|now i can stretch out my hand and grasp some of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0086.mp3|as she attempted to do so the sunshine vanished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0088.mp3|to judge from the bright expression that was dancing on pearl's features|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0089.mp3|her mother could have fancied that the child had absorbed it into herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0091.mp3|with a gleam about her path|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0092.mp3|as they should plunge into some gloomier shade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0093.mp3|there was no other attribute that so much impressed her with a sense of new and untransmitted vigour in pearl's nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0094.mp3|as this never failing vivacity of spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0095.mp3|she had not the disease of sadness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0096.mp3|which almost all children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0097.mp3|in these latter days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0100.mp3|from the troubles of their ancestors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0104.mp3|and but the reflex of the wild energy with which hester had fought against her sorrows before pearl's birth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0105.mp3|it was certainly a doubtful charm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0107.mp3|metallic lustre to the child's character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0109.mp3|what some people want throughout life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0110.mp3|a grief that should deeply touch her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0112.mp3|but there was time enough yet for little pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0115.mp3|looking about her from the spot where pearl had stood still in the sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0116.mp3|we will sit down a little way within the wood and rest ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0118.mp3|but you may sit down if you will tell me a story meanwhile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0119.mp3|a story child said hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0121.mp3|a story about the black man answered pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0123.mp3|and looking up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0125.mp3|half mischievously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0126.mp3|into her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0127.mp3|how he haunts this forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0128.mp3|and carries a book with him a big|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0129.mp3|heavy book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0130.mp3|with iron clasps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0132.mp3|and they are to write their names with their own blood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0135.mp3|mother and who told you this story|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0138.mp3|it was the old dame in the chimney corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0140.mp3|but she fancied me asleep while she was talking of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0141.mp3|she said that a thousand and a thousand people had met him here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0142.mp3|and had written in his book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0143.mp3|and have his mark on them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0144.mp3|and that ugly tempered lady old mistress hibbins was one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0147.mp3|the old dame said that this scarlet letter was the black man's mark on thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0149.mp3|here in the dark wood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0150.mp3|is it true mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0152.mp3|not that i remember said the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0153.mp3|if thou fearest to leave me in our cottage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0154.mp3|thou mightest take me along with thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0155.mp3|i would very gladly go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0156.mp3|but mother tell me now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0157.mp3|is there such a black man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0158.mp3|and didst thou ever meet him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0159.mp3|and is this his mark wilt thou let me be at peace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0160.mp3|if i once tell thee asked her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0161.mp3|yes if thou tellest me all answered pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0162.mp3|once in my life i met the black man said her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0163.mp3|this scarlet letter is his mark thus conversing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0164.mp3|they entered sufficiently deep into the wood to secure themselves from the observation of any casual passenger along the forest track|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0166.mp3|which at some epoch of the preceding century|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0167.mp3|had been a gigantic pine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0168.mp3|with its roots and trunk in the darksome shade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0169.mp3|and its head aloft in the upper atmosphere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0171.mp3|with a leaf strewn bank rising gently on either side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0172.mp3|and a brook flowing through the midst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0173.mp3|over a bed of fallen and drowned leaves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0174.mp3|the trees impending over it had flung down great branches from time to time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0175.mp3|which choked up the current|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0176.mp3|and compelled it to form eddies and black depths at some points|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0178.mp3|in its swifter and livelier passages there appeared a channel way of pebbles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0180.mp3|sparkling sand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0181.mp3|letting the eyes follow along the course of the stream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0182.mp3|they could catch the reflected light from its water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0183.mp3|at some short distance within the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0184.mp3|but soon lost all traces of it amid the bewilderment of tree trunks and underbrush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0186.mp3|all these giant trees and boulders of granite seemed intent on making a mystery of the course of this small brook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0191.mp3|it should whisper tales out of the heart of the old forest whence it flowed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0192.mp3|or mirror its revelations on the smooth surface of a pool|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0195.mp3|as it stole onward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0200.mp3|but melancholy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0201.mp3|like the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without playfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0202.mp3|and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintance and events of sombre hue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0205.mp3|foolish and tiresome little brook cried pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0207.mp3|why art thou so sad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0209.mp3|and do not be all the time sighing and murmuring but the brook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0210.mp3|in the course of its little lifetime among the forest trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0211.mp3|had gone through so solemn an experience that it could not help talking about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0212.mp3|and seemed to have nothing else to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0214.mp3|inasmuch as the current of her life gushed from a well spring as mysterious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0215.mp3|and had flowed through scenes shadowed as heavily with gloom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0216.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0217.mp3|unlike the little stream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0218.mp3|she danced and sparkled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0219.mp3|and prattled airily along her course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0220.mp3|what does this sad little brook say mother inquired she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0221.mp3|if thou hadst a sorrow of thine own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0222.mp3|the brook might tell thee of it answered her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0223.mp3|even as it is telling me of mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0224.mp3|but now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0226.mp3|i hear a footstep along the path|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0227.mp3|and the noise of one putting aside the branches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0229.mp3|and leave me to speak with him that comes yonder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0230.mp3|is it the black man asked pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0231.mp3|wilt thou go and play|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0232.mp3|child repeated her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0233.mp3|but do not stray far into the wood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0234.mp3|and take heed that thou come at my first call|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0237.mp3|but if it be the black man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0241.mp3|silly child said her mother impatiently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0242.mp3|it is no black man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0243.mp3|thou canst see him now through the trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0244.mp3|it is the minister and so it is said the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0245.mp3|and mother he has his hand over his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0247.mp3|when the minister wrote his name in the book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0248.mp3|the black man set his mark in that place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0253.mp3|and thou shalt tease me as thou wilt another time cried hester prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0254.mp3|but do not stray far|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0256.mp3|the child went singing away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0257.mp3|following up the current of the brook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0258.mp3|and striving to mingle a more lightsome cadence with its melancholy voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0259.mp3|but the little stream would not be comforted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0260.mp3|and still kept telling its unintelligible secret of some very mournful mystery that had happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0261.mp3|or making a prophetic lamentation about something that was yet to happen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0262.mp3|within the verge of the dismal forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0269.mp3|and some scarlet columbines that she found growing in the crevice of a high rock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0270.mp3|when her elf child had departed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0271.mp3|hester prynne made a step or two towards the track that led through the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0273.mp3|she beheld the minister advancing along the path entirely alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0274.mp3|and leaning on a staff which he had cut by the wayside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0275.mp3|he looked haggard and feeble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0278.mp3|nor in any other situation where he deemed himself liable to notice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0280.mp3|in this intense seclusion of the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0281.mp3|which of itself would have been a heavy trial to the spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0282.mp3|there was a listlessness in his gait|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0284.mp3|nor felt any desire to do so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0285.mp3|but would have been glad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0286.mp3|could he be glad of anything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0287.mp3|to fling himself down at the root of the nearest tree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0288.mp3|and lie there passive for evermore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0289.mp3|the leaves might bestrew him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0290.mp3|and the soil gradually accumulate and form a little hillock over his frame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0292.mp3|death was too definite an object to be wished for or avoided|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0293.mp3|to hester's eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0294.mp3|the reverend mister dimmesdale exhibited no symptom of positive and vivacious suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0295.mp3|except that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_16_hawthorne_0297.mp3|he kept his hand over his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0001.mp3|he had almost gone by before hester prynne could gather voice enough to attract his observation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0002.mp3|at length she succeeded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0003.mp3|arthur dimmesdale she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0004.mp3|faintly at first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0005.mp3|then louder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0006.mp3|but hoarsely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0007.mp3|arthur dimmesdale who speaks answered the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0008.mp3|gathering himself quickly up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0009.mp3|he stood more erect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0010.mp3|like a man taken by surprise in a mood to which he was reluctant to have witnesses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0011.mp3|throwing his eyes anxiously in the direction of the voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0012.mp3|he indistinctly beheld a form under the trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0013.mp3|clad in garments so sombre|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0015.mp3|that he knew not whether it were a woman or a shadow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0016.mp3|it may be that his pathway through life was haunted thus by a spectre that had stolen out from among his thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0020.mp3|art thou in life even so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0022.mp3|in such life as has been mine these seven years past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0024.mp3|arthur dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0025.mp3|dost thou yet live it was no wonder that they thus questioned one another's actual and bodily existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0026.mp3|and even doubted of their own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0028.mp3|but now stood coldly shuddering in mutual dread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0033.mp3|because the crisis flung back to them their consciousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0034.mp3|and revealed to each heart its history and experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0035.mp3|as life never does|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0036.mp3|except at such breathless epochs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0037.mp3|the soul beheld its features in the mirror of the passing moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0038.mp3|it was with fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0039.mp3|and tremulously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0043.mp3|reluctant necessity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0044.mp3|that arthur dimmesdale put forth his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0048.mp3|cold as it was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0049.mp3|took away what was dreariest in the interview|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0050.mp3|they now felt themselves at least inhabitants of the same sphere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0051.mp3|without a word more spoken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0052.mp3|neither he nor she assuming the guidance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0053.mp3|but with an unexpressed consent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0054.mp3|they glided back into the shadow of the woods whence hester had emerged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0055.mp3|and sat down on the heap of moss where she and pearl had before been sitting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0056.mp3|when they found voice to speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0058.mp3|about the gloomy sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0059.mp3|the threatening storm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0063.mp3|thus they went onward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0064.mp3|not boldly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0065.mp3|but step by step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0066.mp3|into the themes that were brooding deepest in their hearts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0067.mp3|so long estranged by fate and circumstances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0068.mp3|they needed something slight and casual to run before and throw open the doors of intercourse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0069.mp3|so that their real thoughts might be led across the threshold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0072.mp3|hast thou found peace she smiled drearily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0073.mp3|looking down upon her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0074.mp3|hast thou she asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0075.mp3|none nothing but despair he answered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0076.mp3|what else could i look for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0078.mp3|and leading such a life as mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0079.mp3|were i an atheist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0080.mp3|a man devoid of conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0081.mp3|a wretch with coarse and brutal instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0085.mp3|as matters stand with my soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0086.mp3|whatever of good capacity there originally was in me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0087.mp3|all of god's gifts that were the choicest have become the ministers of spiritual torment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0088.mp3|hester i am most miserable the people reverence thee said hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0089.mp3|and surely thou workest good among them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0090.mp3|doth this bring thee no comfort more misery hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0091.mp3|only the more misery answered the clergyman with a bitter smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0092.mp3|as concerns the good which i may appear to do i have no faith in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0093.mp3|it must needs be a delusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0094.mp3|what can a ruined soul like mine effect towards the redemption of other souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0096.mp3|and as for the people's reverence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0097.mp3|would that it were turned to scorn and hatred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0100.mp3|a consolation that i must stand up in my pulpit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0101.mp3|and meet so many eyes turned upward to my face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0102.mp3|as if the light of heaven were beaming from it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0103.mp3|must see my flock hungry for the truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0104.mp3|and listening to my words as if a tongue of pentecost were speaking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0105.mp3|and then look inward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0107.mp3|i have laughed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0108.mp3|in bitterness and agony of heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0110.mp3|and satan laughs at it you wrong yourself in this said hester gently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0111.mp3|you have deeply and sorely repented|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0112.mp3|your sin is left behind you in the days long past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0113.mp3|your present life is not less holy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0114.mp3|in very truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0115.mp3|than it seems in people's eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0116.mp3|is there no reality in the penitence thus sealed and witnessed by good works|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0117.mp3|and wherefore should it not bring you peace no hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0118.mp3|no replied the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0119.mp3|there is no substance in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0120.mp3|it is cold and dead and can do nothing for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0121.mp3|of penance i have had enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0122.mp3|of penitence there has been none|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0125.mp3|and have shown myself to mankind as they will see me at the judgment seat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0128.mp3|that wear the scarlet letter openly upon your bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0129.mp3|mine burns in secret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0130.mp3|thou little knowest what a relief it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0133.mp3|had i one friend or were it my worst enemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0134.mp3|to whom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0135.mp3|when sickened with the praises of all other men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0136.mp3|i could daily betake myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0137.mp3|and be known as the vilest of all sinners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0138.mp3|methinks my soul might keep itself alive thereby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0139.mp3|even thus much of truth would save me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0140.mp3|but now it is all falsehood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0143.mp3|yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0144.mp3|uttering his long restrained emotions so vehemently as he did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0145.mp3|his words here offered her the very point of circumstances in which to interpose what she came to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0146.mp3|she conquered her fears and spoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0147.mp3|such a friend as thou hast even now wished for said she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0148.mp3|with whom to weep over thy sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0149.mp3|thou hast in me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0150.mp3|the partner of it again she hesitated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0151.mp3|but brought out the words with an effort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0152.mp3|thou hast long had such an enemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0153.mp3|and dwellest with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0156.mp3|and clutching at his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0157.mp3|as if he would have torn it out of his bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0159.mp3|what sayest thou cried he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0160.mp3|an enemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0161.mp3|and under mine own roof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0163.mp3|in permitting him to lie for so many years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0166.mp3|for a single moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0167.mp3|at the mercy of one whose purposes could not be other than malevolent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0168.mp3|the very contiguity of his enemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0169.mp3|beneath whatever mask the latter might conceal himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0170.mp3|was enough to disturb the magnetic sphere of a being so sensitive as arthur dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0171.mp3|there had been a period when hester was less alive to this consideration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0173.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0174.mp3|in the misanthropy of her own trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0175.mp3|she left the minister to bear what she might picture to herself as a more tolerable doom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0177.mp3|since the night of his vigil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0178.mp3|all her sympathies towards him had been both softened and invigorated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0179.mp3|she now read his heart more accurately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0180.mp3|she doubted not that the continual presence of roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0181.mp3|the secret poison of his malignity infecting all the air about him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0183.mp3|as a physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0184.mp3|with the minister's physical and spiritual infirmities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0185.mp3|that these bad opportunities had been turned to a cruel purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0186.mp3|by means of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0187.mp3|the sufferer's conscience had been kept in an irritated state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0188.mp3|the tendency of which was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0189.mp3|not to cure by wholesome pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0190.mp3|but to disorganize and corrupt his spiritual being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0193.mp3|could hardly fail to be insanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0194.mp3|and hereafter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0195.mp3|that eternal alienation from the good and true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0196.mp3|of which madness is perhaps the earthly type|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0197.mp3|such was the ruin to which she had brought the man once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0199.mp3|still so passionately loved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0200.mp3|hester felt that the sacrifice of the clergyman's good name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0201.mp3|and death itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0202.mp3|as she had already told roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0203.mp3|would have been infinitely preferable to the alternative which she had taken upon herself to choose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0204.mp3|and now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0205.mp3|rather than have had this grievous wrong to confess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0207.mp3|and died there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0208.mp3|at arthur dimmesdale's feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0209.mp3|oh arthur cried she forgive me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0210.mp3|in all things else i have striven to be true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0211.mp3|truth was the one virtue which i might have held fast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0212.mp3|and did hold fast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0213.mp3|through all extremity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0214.mp3|save when thy good thy life thy fame were put in question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0215.mp3|then i consented to a deception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0217.mp3|dost thou not see what i would say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0218.mp3|that old man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0219.mp3|the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0220.mp3|he whom they call roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0221.mp3|he was my husband the minister looked at her for an instant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0222.mp3|with all that violence of passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0223.mp3|which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0224.mp3|intermixed in more shapes than one with his higher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0226.mp3|softer qualities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0229.mp3|the portion of him which the devil claimed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0230.mp3|and through which he sought to win the rest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0231.mp3|never was there a blacker or a fiercer frown than hester now encountered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0232.mp3|for the brief space that it lasted it was a dark transfiguration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0233.mp3|but his character had been so much enfeebled by suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0234.mp3|that even its lower energies were incapable of more than a temporary struggle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0235.mp3|he sank down on the ground and buried his face in his hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0236.mp3|i might have known it murmured he i did know it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0237.mp3|was not the secret told me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0238.mp3|in the natural recoil of my heart at the first sight of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0240.mp3|why did i not understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0244.mp3|little knowest all the horror of this thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0246.mp3|the indelicacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0247.mp3|the horrible ugliness of this exposure of a sick and guilty heart to the very eye that would gloat over it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0248.mp3|woman woman thou art accountable for this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0249.mp3|i cannot forgive thee thou shalt forgive me cried hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0250.mp3|flinging herself on the fallen leaves beside him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0251.mp3|let god punish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0252.mp3|thou shalt forgive with sudden and desperate tenderness she threw her arms around him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0253.mp3|and pressed his head against her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0254.mp3|little caring though his cheek rested on the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0255.mp3|he would have released himself but strove in vain to do so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0256.mp3|hester would not set him free|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0257.mp3|lest he should look her sternly in the face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0258.mp3|all the world had frowned on her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0259.mp3|for seven long years had it frowned upon this lonely woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0260.mp3|and still she bore it all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0263.mp3|heaven likewise had frowned upon her and she had not died|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0264.mp3|but the frown of this pale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0269.mp3|wilt thou yet forgive me she repeated over and over again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0270.mp3|wilt thou not frown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0273.mp3|with a deep utterance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0274.mp3|out of an abyss of sadness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0276.mp3|i freely forgive you now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0277.mp3|may god forgive us both|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0278.mp3|we are not hester the worst sinners in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0279.mp3|there is one worse than even the polluted priest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0280.mp3|that old man's revenge has been blacker than my sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0281.mp3|he has violated in cold blood the sanctity of a human heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0283.mp3|what we did had a consecration of its own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0284.mp3|we felt it so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0286.mp3|hast thou forgotten it hush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0288.mp3|rising from the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0290.mp3|i have not forgotten they sat down again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0291.mp3|side by side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0292.mp3|and hand clasped in hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0293.mp3|on the mossy trunk of the fallen tree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0294.mp3|life had never brought them a gloomier hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0295.mp3|it was the point whither their pathway had so long been tending|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0296.mp3|and darkening ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0297.mp3|as it stole along|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0299.mp3|and claim another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0300.mp3|and another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0303.mp3|another moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0304.mp3|the forest was obscure around them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0306.mp3|the boughs were tossing heavily above their heads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0307.mp3|while one solemn old tree groaned dolefully to another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0308.mp3|as if telling the sad story of the pair that sat beneath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0310.mp3|and yet they lingered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0311.mp3|how dreary looked the forest track that led backward to the settlement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0312.mp3|where hester prynne must take up again the burden of her ignominy and the minister the hollow mockery of his good name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0313.mp3|so they lingered an instant longer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0314.mp3|no golden light had ever been so precious as the gloom of this dark forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0315.mp3|here seen only by his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0316.mp3|the scarlet letter need not burn into the bosom of the fallen woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0317.mp3|here seen only by her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0319.mp3|false to god and man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0321.mp3|for one moment true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0322.mp3|he started at a thought that suddenly occurred to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0323.mp3|hester cried he here is a new horror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0325.mp3|will he continue then to keep our secret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0328.mp3|and it has grown upon him by the hidden practices of his revenge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0330.mp3|he will doubtless seek other means of satiating his dark passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0331.mp3|and i|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0332.mp3|how am i to live longer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0333.mp3|breathing the same air with this deadly enemy exclaimed arthur dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0334.mp3|shrinking within himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0336.mp3|a gesture that had grown involuntary with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0337.mp3|think for me hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0338.mp3|thou art strong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0339.mp3|resolve for me thou must dwell no longer with this man said hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0340.mp3|slowly and firmly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0341.mp3|thy heart must be no longer under his evil eye it were far worse than death replied the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0342.mp3|but how to avoid it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0343.mp3|what choice remains to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0344.mp3|shall i lie down again on these withered leaves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0345.mp3|where i cast myself when thou didst tell me what he was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0346.mp3|must i sink down there and die at once alas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0347.mp3|what a ruin has befallen thee said hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0348.mp3|with the tears gushing into her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0350.mp3|there is no other cause the judgment of god is on me answered the conscience stricken priest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0351.mp3|it is too mighty for me to struggle with heaven would show mercy rejoined hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0352.mp3|hadst thou but the strength to take advantage of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0353.mp3|be thou strong for me answered he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0354.mp3|advise me what to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0359.mp3|and instinctively exercising a magnetic power over a spirit so shattered and subdued that it could hardly hold itself erect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0360.mp3|doth the universe lie within the compass of yonder town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0361.mp3|which only a little time ago was but a leaf strewn desert|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0362.mp3|as lonely as this around us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0364.mp3|backward to the settlement thou sayest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0365.mp3|yes but onward too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0367.mp3|and deeper into the wilderness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0368.mp3|less plainly to be seen at every step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0370.mp3|there thou art free|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0371.mp3|so brief a journey would bring thee from a world where thou hast been most wretched|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0372.mp3|to one where thou mayest still be happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0375.mp3|but only under the fallen leaves replied the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0376.mp3|with a sad smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0377.mp3|then there is the broad pathway of the sea continued hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0378.mp3|it brought thee hither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0379.mp3|if thou so choose it will bear thee back again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0380.mp3|in our native land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0383.mp3|or surely in germany in france in pleasant italy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0384.mp3|thou wouldst be beyond his power and knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0385.mp3|and what hast thou to do with all these iron men and their opinions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0386.mp3|they have kept thy better part in bondage too long already it cannot be answered the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0388.mp3|i am powerless to go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0389.mp3|wretched and sinful as i am|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0390.mp3|i have had no other thought than to drag on my earthly existence in the sphere where providence hath placed me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0391.mp3|lost as my own soul is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0392.mp3|i would still do what i may for other human souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0393.mp3|i dare not quit my post|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0394.mp3|though an unfaithful sentinel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0395.mp3|whose sure reward is death and dishonour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0397.mp3|fervently resolved to buoy him up with her own energy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0398.mp3|but thou shalt leave it all behind thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0399.mp3|it shall not cumber thy steps as thou treadest along the forest path|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0400.mp3|neither shalt thou freight the ship with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0401.mp3|if thou prefer to cross the sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0402.mp3|leave this wreck and ruin here where it hath happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0403.mp3|meddle no more with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0405.mp3|hast thou exhausted possibility in the failure of this one trial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0407.mp3|the future is yet full of trial and success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0408.mp3|there is happiness to be enjoyed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0409.mp3|there is good to be done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0410.mp3|exchange this false life of thine for a true one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0412.mp3|if thy spirit summon thee to such a mission|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0413.mp3|the teacher and apostle of the red men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0415.mp3|as is more thy nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0416.mp3|be a scholar and a sage among the wisest and the most renowned of the cultivated world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0417.mp3|preach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0422.mp3|and make thyself another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0423.mp3|and a high one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0424.mp3|such as thou canst wear without fear or shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0425.mp3|why shouldst thou tarry so much as one other day in the torments that have so gnawed into thy life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0426.mp3|that have made thee feeble to will and to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0427.mp3|that will leave thee powerless even to repent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0429.mp3|and away oh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0431.mp3|in whose eyes a fitful light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0432.mp3|kindled by her enthusiasm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0433.mp3|flashed up and died away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0434.mp3|thou tellest of running a race to a man whose knees are tottering beneath him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0435.mp3|i must die here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0436.mp3|there is not the strength or courage left me to venture into the wide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0438.mp3|difficult world alone it was the last expression of the despondency of a broken spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0439.mp3|he lacked energy to grasp the better fortune that seemed within his reach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0440.mp3|he repeated the word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0443.mp3|in a deep whisper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_17_hawthorne_0444.mp3|then all was spoken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0002.mp3|but with fear betwixt them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0003.mp3|and a kind of horror at her boldness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0004.mp3|who had spoken what he vaguely hinted at|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0005.mp3|but dared not speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0007.mp3|with a mind of native courage and activity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0008.mp3|and for so long a period not merely estranged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0009.mp3|but outlawed from society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0010.mp3|had habituated herself to such latitude of speculation as was altogether foreign to the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0011.mp3|she had wandered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0012.mp3|without rule or guidance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0013.mp3|in a moral wilderness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0016.mp3|and shadowy as the untamed forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0017.mp3|amid the gloom of which they were now holding a colloquy that was to decide their fate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0018.mp3|her intellect and heart had their home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0020.mp3|in desert places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0021.mp3|where she roamed as freely as the wild indian in his woods|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0022.mp3|for years past she had looked from this estranged point of view at human institutions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0023.mp3|and whatever priests or legislators had established|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0024.mp3|criticising all with hardly more reverence than the indian would feel for the clerical band|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0025.mp3|the judicial robe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0026.mp3|the pillory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0027.mp3|the gallows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0028.mp3|the fireside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0029.mp3|or the church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0030.mp3|the tendency of her fate and fortunes had been to set her free|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0031.mp3|the scarlet letter was her passport into regions where other women dared not tread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0032.mp3|shame despair solitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0033.mp3|these had been her teachers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0034.mp3|stern and wild ones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0035.mp3|and they had made her strong but taught her much amiss|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0038.mp3|had never gone through an experience calculated to lead him beyond the scope of generally received laws|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0039.mp3|although|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0040.mp3|in a single instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0041.mp3|he had so fearfully transgressed one of the most sacred of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0042.mp3|but this had been a sin of passion not of principle nor even purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0043.mp3|since that wretched epoch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0044.mp3|he had watched with morbid zeal and minuteness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0045.mp3|not his acts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0046.mp3|for those it was easy to arrange|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0047.mp3|but each breath of emotion and his every thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0048.mp3|at the head of the social system|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0051.mp3|its principles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0052.mp3|and even its prejudices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0053.mp3|as a priest the framework of his order inevitably hemmed him in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0054.mp3|as a man who had once sinned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0055.mp3|but who kept his conscience all alive and painfully sensitive by the fretting of an unhealed wound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0056.mp3|he might have been supposed safer within the line of virtue than if he had never sinned at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0057.mp3|thus we seem to see that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0058.mp3|as regarded hester prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0059.mp3|the whole seven years of outlaw and ignominy had been little other than a preparation for this very hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0061.mp3|were such a man once more to fall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0062.mp3|what plea could be urged in extenuation of his crime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0064.mp3|unless it avail him somewhat that he was broken down by long and exquisite suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0065.mp3|that his mind was darkened and confused by the very remorse which harrowed it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0067.mp3|between fleeing as an avowed criminal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0068.mp3|and remaining as a hypocrite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0069.mp3|conscience might find it hard to strike the balance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0070.mp3|that it was human to avoid the peril of death and infamy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0073.mp3|finally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0074.mp3|to this poor pilgrim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0075.mp3|on his dreary and desert path|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0076.mp3|faint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0079.mp3|there appeared a glimpse of human affection and sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0081.mp3|and a true one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0082.mp3|in exchange for the heavy doom which he was now expiating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0083.mp3|and be the stern and sad truth spoken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0084.mp3|that the breach which guilt has once made into the human soul is never|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0085.mp3|in this mortal state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0086.mp3|repaired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0087.mp3|it may be watched and guarded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0088.mp3|so that the enemy shall not force his way again into the citadel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0089.mp3|and might even in his subsequent assaults|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0090.mp3|select some other avenue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0091.mp3|in preference to that where he had formerly succeeded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0092.mp3|but there is still the ruined wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0093.mp3|and near it the stealthy tread of the foe that would win over again his unforgotten triumph|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0094.mp3|the struggle if there were one need not be described|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0095.mp3|let it suffice that the clergyman resolved to flee and not alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0096.mp3|if in all these past seven years thought he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0097.mp3|i could recall one instant of peace or hope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0098.mp3|i would yet endure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0099.mp3|for the sake of that earnest of heaven's mercy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0100.mp3|but now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0101.mp3|since i am irrevocably doomed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0104.mp3|if this be the path to a better life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0105.mp3|as hester would persuade me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0106.mp3|i surely give up no fairer prospect by pursuing it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0108.mp3|so powerful is she to sustain so tender to soothe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0109.mp3|o thou to whom i dare not lift mine eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0110.mp3|wilt thou yet pardon me thou wilt go said hester calmly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0111.mp3|as he met her glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0112.mp3|the decision once made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0113.mp3|a glow of strange enjoyment threw its flickering brightness over the trouble of his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0114.mp3|it was the exhilarating effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0115.mp3|upon a prisoner just escaped from the dungeon of his own heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0116.mp3|of breathing the wild|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0117.mp3|free atmosphere of an unredeemed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0119.mp3|lawless region|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0120.mp3|his spirit rose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0122.mp3|with a bound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0123.mp3|and attained a nearer prospect of the sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0124.mp3|than throughout all the misery which had kept him grovelling on the earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0125.mp3|of a deeply religious temperament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0126.mp3|there was inevitably a tinge of the devotional in his mood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0127.mp3|do i feel joy again cried he wondering at himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0128.mp3|methought the germ of it was dead in me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0130.mp3|i seem to have flung myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0131.mp3|sick sin stained and sorrow blackened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0133.mp3|and to have risen up all made anew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0134.mp3|and with new powers to glorify him that hath been merciful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0135.mp3|this is already the better life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0137.mp3|the past is gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0138.mp3|wherefore should we linger upon it now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0139.mp3|see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0140.mp3|with this symbol i undo it all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0142.mp3|she undid the clasp that fastened the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0144.mp3|taking it from her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0145.mp3|threw it to a distance among the withered leaves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0146.mp3|the mystic token alighted on the hither verge of the stream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0148.mp3|it would have fallen into the water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0149.mp3|and have given the little brook another woe to carry onward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0150.mp3|besides the unintelligible tale which it still kept murmuring about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0151.mp3|but there lay the embroidered letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0152.mp3|glittering like a lost jewel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0153.mp3|which some ill fated wanderer might pick up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0154.mp3|and thenceforth be haunted by strange phantoms of guilt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0155.mp3|sinkings of the heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0159.mp3|deep sigh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0160.mp3|in which the burden of shame and anguish departed from her spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0162.mp3|she had not known the weight until she felt the freedom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0163.mp3|by another impulse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0164.mp3|she took off the formal cap that confined her hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0165.mp3|and down it fell upon her shoulders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0166.mp3|dark and rich|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0167.mp3|with at once a shadow and a light in its abundance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0168.mp3|and imparting the charm of softness to her features|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0170.mp3|and beamed out of her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0171.mp3|a radiant and tender smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0172.mp3|that seemed gushing from the very heart of womanhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0173.mp3|a crimson flush was glowing on her cheek that had been long so pale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0176.mp3|and the whole richness of her beauty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0177.mp3|came back from what men call the irrevocable past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0178.mp3|and clustered themselves with her maiden hope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0179.mp3|and a happiness before unknown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0180.mp3|within the magic circle of this hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0181.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0183.mp3|it vanished with their sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0185.mp3|as with a sudden smile of heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0186.mp3|forth burst the sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0187.mp3|pouring a very flood into the obscure forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0189.mp3|transmuting the yellow fallen ones to gold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0191.mp3|the objects that had made a shadow hitherto|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0193.mp3|the course of the little brook might be traced by its merry gleam afar into the wood's heart of mystery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0194.mp3|which had become a mystery of joy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0195.mp3|such was the sympathy of nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0196.mp3|that wild|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0197.mp3|heathen nature of the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0198.mp3|never subjugated by human law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0199.mp3|nor illumined by higher truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0200.mp3|with the bliss of these two spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0203.mp3|or aroused from a death like slumber|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0204.mp3|must always create a sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0205.mp3|filling the heart so full of radiance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0206.mp3|that it overflows upon the outward world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0207.mp3|had the forest still kept its gloom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0208.mp3|it would have been bright in hester's eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0213.mp3|thou hast seen her yes i know it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0214.mp3|but thou wilt see her now with other eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0215.mp3|she is a strange child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0216.mp3|i hardly comprehend her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0219.mp3|and wilt advise me how to deal with her dost thou think the child will be glad to know me asked the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0220.mp3|somewhat uneasily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0221.mp3|i have long shrunk from children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0222.mp3|because they often show a distrust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0223.mp3|a backwardness to be familiar with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0224.mp3|i have even been afraid of little pearl ah|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0225.mp3|that was sad answered the mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0226.mp3|but she will love thee dearly and thou her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0227.mp3|she is not far off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0228.mp3|i will call her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0232.mp3|standing in a streak of sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0234.mp3|on the other side of the brook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0235.mp3|so thou thinkest the child will love me hester smiled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0236.mp3|and again called to pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0237.mp3|who was visible at some distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0238.mp3|as the minister had described her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0239.mp3|like a bright apparelled vision in a sunbeam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0240.mp3|which fell down upon her through an arch of boughs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0242.mp3|now like a real child now like a child's spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0243.mp3|as the splendour went and came again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0244.mp3|she heard her mother's voice and approached slowly through the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0245.mp3|pearl had not found the hour pass wearisomely while her mother sat talking with the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0246.mp3|the great black forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0247.mp3|stern as it showed itself to those who brought the guilt and troubles of the world into its bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0248.mp3|became the playmate of the lonely infant as well as it knew how|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0249.mp3|sombre as it was it put on the kindest of its moods to welcome her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0250.mp3|it offered her the partridge berries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0251.mp3|the growth of the preceding autumn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0252.mp3|but ripening only in the spring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0253.mp3|and now red as drops of blood upon the withered leaves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0254.mp3|these pearl gathered and was pleased with their wild flavour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0255.mp3|the small denizens of the wilderness hardly took pains to move out of her path|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0258.mp3|with a brood of ten behind her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0259.mp3|ran forward threateningly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0261.mp3|and clucked to her young ones not to be afraid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0262.mp3|a pigeon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0263.mp3|alone on a low branch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0264.mp3|allowed pearl to come beneath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0265.mp3|and uttered a sound as much of greeting as alarm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0266.mp3|a squirrel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0267.mp3|from the lofty depths of his domestic tree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0268.mp3|chattered either in anger or merriment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0270.mp3|that it is hard to distinguish between his moods|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0272.mp3|it was a last year's nut and already gnawed by his sharp tooth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0273.mp3|a fox|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0274.mp3|startled from his sleep by her light footstep on the leaves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0275.mp3|looked inquisitively at pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0277.mp3|or renew his nap on the same spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0278.mp3|a wolf it is said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0279.mp3|but here the tale has surely lapsed into the improbable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0281.mp3|and offered his savage head to be patted by her hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0283.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0284.mp3|that the mother forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0285.mp3|and these wild things which it nourished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0287.mp3|and she was gentler here than in the grassy margined streets of the settlement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0288.mp3|or in her mother's cottage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0293.mp3|adorn thyself with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0294.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0295.mp3|to please them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0296.mp3|pearl gathered the violets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0298.mp3|and columbines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0300.mp3|which the old trees held down before her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0301.mp3|with these she decorated her hair and her young waist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0302.mp3|and became a nymph child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0304.mp3|or whatever else was in closest sympathy with the antique wood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0305.mp3|in such guise had pearl adorned herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0306.mp3|when she heard her mother's voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0307.mp3|and came slowly back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_18_hawthorne_0308.mp3|slowly for she saw the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0000.mp3|thou wilt love her dearly repeated hester prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0001.mp3|as she and the minister sat watching little pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0002.mp3|dost thou not think her beautiful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0004.mp3|had she gathered pearls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0006.mp3|and rubies in the wood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0007.mp3|they could not have become her better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0008.mp3|she is a splendid child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0009.mp3|but i know whose brow she has dost thou know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0011.mp3|with an unquiet smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0012.mp3|that this dear child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0013.mp3|tripping about always at thy side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0014.mp3|hath caused me many an alarm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0016.mp3|oh hester what a thought is that and how terrible to dread it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0017.mp3|that my own features were partly repeated in her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0018.mp3|and so strikingly that the world might see them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0019.mp3|but she is mostly thine no no|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0020.mp3|not mostly answered the mother with a tender smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0023.mp3|but how strangely beautiful she looks with those wild flowers in her hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0024.mp3|it is as if one of the fairies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0026.mp3|had decked her out to meet us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0027.mp3|it was with a feeling which neither of them had ever before experienced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0028.mp3|that they sat and watched pearl's slow advance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0029.mp3|in her was visible the tie that united them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0030.mp3|she had been offered to the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0033.mp3|in which was revealed the secret they so darkly sought to hide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0034.mp3|all written in this symbol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0035.mp3|all plainly manifest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0036.mp3|had there been a prophet or magician skilled to read the character of flame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0037.mp3|and pearl was the oneness of their being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0038.mp3|be the foregone evil what it might|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0039.mp3|how could they doubt that their earthly lives and future destinies were conjoined when they beheld at once the material union|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0040.mp3|and the spiritual idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0041.mp3|in whom they met|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0042.mp3|and were to dwell immortally together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0043.mp3|thoughts like these|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0044.mp3|and perhaps other thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0045.mp3|which they did not acknowledge or define|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0049.mp3|in thy way of accosting her whispered hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0050.mp3|our pearl is a fitful and fantastic little elf sometimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0052.mp3|when she does not fully comprehend the why and wherefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0053.mp3|but the child hath strong affections|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0055.mp3|and will love thee thou canst not think said the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0057.mp3|how my heart dreads this interview|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0061.mp3|as i already told thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0062.mp3|children are not readily won to be familiar with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0063.mp3|they will not climb my knee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0064.mp3|nor prattle in my ear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0065.mp3|nor answer to my smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0066.mp3|but stand apart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0067.mp3|and eye me strangely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0068.mp3|even little babes when i take them in my arms weep bitterly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0069.mp3|yet pearl twice in her little lifetime hath been kind to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0070.mp3|the first time thou knowest it well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0072.mp3|and thou didst plead so bravely in her behalf and mine answered the mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0074.mp3|fear nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0075.mp3|she may be strange and shy at first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0076.mp3|but will soon learn to love thee by this time pearl had reached the margin of the brook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0078.mp3|gazing silently at hester and the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0079.mp3|who still sat together on the mossy tree trunk waiting to receive her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0080.mp3|just where she had paused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0081.mp3|the brook chanced to form a pool so smooth and quiet that it reflected a perfect image of her little figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0082.mp3|with all the brilliant picturesqueness of her beauty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0083.mp3|in its adornment of flowers and wreathed foliage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0084.mp3|but more refined and spiritualized than the reality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0085.mp3|this image|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0086.mp3|so nearly identical with the living pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0088.mp3|it was strange|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0089.mp3|the way in which pearl stood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0090.mp3|looking so steadfastly at them through the dim medium of the forest gloom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0093.mp3|all glorified with a ray of sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0094.mp3|that was attracted thitherward as by a certain sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0095.mp3|in the brook beneath stood another child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0096.mp3|another and the same|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0097.mp3|with likewise its ray of golden light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0099.mp3|in some indistinct and tantalizing manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0100.mp3|estranged from pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0103.mp3|had strayed out of the sphere in which she and her mother dwelt together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0104.mp3|and was now vainly seeking to return to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0106.mp3|the child and mother were estranged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0107.mp3|but through hester's fault|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0109.mp3|since the latter rambled from her side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0110.mp3|another inmate had been admitted within the circle of the mother's feelings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0111.mp3|and so modified the aspect of them all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0113.mp3|the returning wanderer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0114.mp3|could not find her wonted place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0115.mp3|and hardly knew where she was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0116.mp3|i have a strange fancy observed the sensitive minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0117.mp3|that this brook is the boundary between two worlds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0118.mp3|and that thou canst never meet thy pearl again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0119.mp3|or is she an elfish spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0121.mp3|as the legends of our childhood taught us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0122.mp3|is forbidden to cross a running stream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0123.mp3|pray hasten her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0124.mp3|for this delay has already imparted a tremor to my nerves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0126.mp3|dearest child said hester encouragingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0127.mp3|and stretching out both her arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0128.mp3|how slow thou art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0129.mp3|when hast thou been so sluggish before now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0130.mp3|here is a friend of mine who must be thy friend also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0131.mp3|thou wilt have twice as much love henceforward as thy mother alone could give thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0132.mp3|leap across the brook and come to us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0133.mp3|thou canst leap like a young deer pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0134.mp3|without responding in any manner to these honey sweet expressions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0135.mp3|remained on the other side of the brook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0136.mp3|now she fixed her bright wild eyes on her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0137.mp3|now on the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0138.mp3|and now included them both in the same glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0139.mp3|as if to detect and explain to herself the relation which they bore to one another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0140.mp3|for some unaccountable reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0141.mp3|as arthur dimmesdale felt the child's eyes upon himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0142.mp3|his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0143.mp3|with that gesture so habitual as to have become involuntary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0144.mp3|stole over his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0145.mp3|at length|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0146.mp3|assuming a singular air of authority|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0147.mp3|pearl stretched out her hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0149.mp3|and pointing evidently towards her mother's breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0151.mp3|in the mirror of the brook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0152.mp3|there was the flower girdled and sunny image of little pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0153.mp3|pointing her small forefinger too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0155.mp3|why dost thou not come to me exclaimed hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0156.mp3|pearl still pointed with her forefinger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0157.mp3|and a frown gathered on her brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0158.mp3|the more impressive from the childish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0159.mp3|the almost baby like aspect of the features that conveyed it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0160.mp3|as her mother still kept beckoning to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0161.mp3|and arraying her face in a holiday suit of unaccustomed smiles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0162.mp3|the child stamped her foot with a yet more imperious look and gesture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0165.mp3|was the fantastic beauty of the image|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0166.mp3|with its reflected frown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0167.mp3|its pointed finger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0168.mp3|and imperious gesture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0176.mp3|was naturally anxious for a more seemly deportment now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0177.mp3|leap across the brook naughty child and run hither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0179.mp3|not a whit startled at her mother's threats any more than mollified by her entreaties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0180.mp3|now suddenly burst into a fit of passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0181.mp3|gesticulating violently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0182.mp3|and throwing her small figure into the most extravagant contortions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0183.mp3|she accompanied this wild outbreak with piercing shrieks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0184.mp3|which the woods reverberated on all sides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0186.mp3|alone as she was in her childish and unreasonable wrath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0187.mp3|it seemed as if a hidden multitude were lending her their sympathy and encouragement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0188.mp3|seen in the brook once more was the shadowy wrath of pearl's image|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0190.mp3|but stamping its foot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0191.mp3|wildly gesticulating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0193.mp3|in the midst of all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0194.mp3|still pointing its small forefinger at hester's bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0195.mp3|i see what ails the child whispered hester to the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0196.mp3|and turning pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal her trouble and annoyance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0197.mp3|children will not abide any|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0198.mp3|the slightest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0199.mp3|change in the accustomed aspect of things that are daily before their eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0201.mp3|if thou hast any means of pacifying the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0202.mp3|do it forthwith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0203.mp3|save it were the cankered wrath of an old witch like mistress hibbins added he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0204.mp3|attempting to smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0205.mp3|i know nothing that i would not sooner encounter than this passion in a child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0207.mp3|as in the wrinkled witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0208.mp3|it has a preternatural effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0211.mp3|and then a heavy sigh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0213.mp3|even before she had time to speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0214.mp3|the blush yielded to a deadly pallor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0215.mp3|pearl said she sadly look down at thy feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0218.mp3|on the hither side of the brook the child turned her eyes to the point indicated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0219.mp3|and there lay the scarlet letter so close upon the margin of the stream that the gold embroidery was reflected in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0220.mp3|bring it hither said hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0221.mp3|come thou and take it up answered pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0222.mp3|was ever such a child observed hester aside to the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0223.mp3|oh i have much to tell thee about her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0224.mp3|but in very truth she is right as regards this hateful token|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0225.mp3|i must bear its torture yet a little longer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0226.mp3|only a few days longer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0227.mp3|until we shall have left this region|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0228.mp3|and look back hither as to a land which we have dreamed of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0229.mp3|the forest cannot hide it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0230.mp3|the mid ocean shall take it from my hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0231.mp3|and swallow it up for ever with these words she advanced to the margin of the brook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0232.mp3|took up the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0233.mp3|and fastened it again into her bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0234.mp3|hopefully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0235.mp3|but a moment ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0236.mp3|as hester had spoken of drowning it in the deep sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0237.mp3|there was a sense of inevitable doom upon her as she thus received back this deadly symbol from the hand of fate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0238.mp3|she had flung it into infinite space|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0239.mp3|she had drawn an hour's free breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0240.mp3|and here again was the scarlet misery glittering on the old spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0241.mp3|so it ever is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0242.mp3|whether thus typified or no|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0243.mp3|that an evil deed invests itself with the character of doom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0244.mp3|hester next gathered up the heavy tresses of her hair and confined them beneath her cap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0245.mp3|as if there were a withering spell in the sad letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0247.mp3|the warmth and richness of her womanhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0248.mp3|departed like fading sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0249.mp3|and a gray shadow seemed to fall across her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0250.mp3|when the dreary change was wrought she extended her hand to pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0251.mp3|dost thou know thy mother now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0254.mp3|reproachfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0255.mp3|but with a subdued tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0256.mp3|wilt thou come across the brook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0257.mp3|and own thy mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0258.mp3|now that she has her shame upon her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0259.mp3|now that she is sad yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0260.mp3|now i will answered the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0261.mp3|bounding across the brook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0262.mp3|and clasping hester in her arms now thou art my mother indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0263.mp3|and i am thy little pearl in a mood of tenderness that was not usual with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0265.mp3|and kissed her brow and both her cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0266.mp3|but then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0268.mp3|pearl put up her mouth and kissed the scarlet letter too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0269.mp3|that was not kind said hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0270.mp3|when thou hast shown me a little love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0272.mp3|he waits to welcome thee replied her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0273.mp3|come thou and entreat his blessing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0275.mp3|wilt thou not love him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0277.mp3|looking up with acute intelligence into her mother's face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0278.mp3|will he go back with us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0281.mp3|into the town not now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0283.mp3|but in days to come he will walk hand in hand with us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0284.mp3|we will have a home and fireside of our own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0285.mp3|and thou shalt sit upon his knee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0286.mp3|and he will teach thee many things and love thee dearly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0287.mp3|thou wilt love him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0288.mp3|wilt thou not and will he always keep his hand over his heart inquired pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0289.mp3|foolish child what a question is that exclaimed her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0292.mp3|whether influenced by the jealousy that seems instinctive with every petted child towards a dangerous rival|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0293.mp3|or from whatever caprice of her freakish nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0295.mp3|it was only by an exertion of force that her mother brought her up to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0297.mp3|and manifesting her reluctance by odd grimaces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0298.mp3|of which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0299.mp3|ever since her babyhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0300.mp3|she had possessed a singular variety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0301.mp3|and could transform her mobile physiognomy into a series of different aspects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0302.mp3|with a new mischief in them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0303.mp3|each and all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0304.mp3|the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0305.mp3|painfully embarrassed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0306.mp3|but hoping that a kiss might prove a talisman to admit him into the child's kindlier regards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0307.mp3|bent forward and impressed one on her brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0309.mp3|pearl broke away from her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0311.mp3|running to the brook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0313.mp3|and bathed her forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0314.mp3|until the unwelcome kiss was quite washed off and diffused through a long lapse of the gliding water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0315.mp3|she then remained apart silently watching hester and the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0316.mp3|while they talked together and made such arrangements as were suggested by their new position and the purposes soon to be fulfilled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0317.mp3|and now this fateful interview had come to a close|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0319.mp3|old trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0320.mp3|which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0321.mp3|with their multitudinous tongues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0322.mp3|would whisper long of what had passed there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0323.mp3|and no mortal be the wiser|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0324.mp3|and the melancholy brook would add this other tale to the mystery with which its little heart was already overburdened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0325.mp3|and whereof it still kept up a murmuring babble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_19_hawthorne_0326.mp3|with not a whit more cheerfulness of tone than for ages heretofore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0001.mp3|in advance of hester prynne and little pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0002.mp3|he threw a backward glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0003.mp3|half expecting that he should discover only some faintly traced features or outline of the mother and the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0004.mp3|slowly fading into the twilight of the woods|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0005.mp3|so great a vicissitude in his life could not at once be received as real|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0006.mp3|but there was hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0008.mp3|still standing beside the tree trunk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0009.mp3|which some blast had overthrown a long antiquity ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0010.mp3|and which time had ever since been covering with moss|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0011.mp3|so that these two fated ones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0012.mp3|with earth's heaviest burden on them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0013.mp3|might there sit down together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0014.mp3|and find a single hour's rest and solace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0015.mp3|and there was pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0017.mp3|lightly dancing from the margin of the brook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0018.mp3|now that the intrusive third person was gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0019.mp3|and taking her old place by her mother's side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0020.mp3|so the minister had not fallen asleep and dreamed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0021.mp3|in order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicity of impression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0023.mp3|he recalled and more thoroughly defined the plans which hester and himself had sketched for their departure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0024.mp3|it had been determined between them that the old world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0025.mp3|with its crowds and cities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0026.mp3|offered them a more eligible shelter and concealment than the wilds of new england or all america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0027.mp3|with its alternatives of an indian wigwam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0028.mp3|or the few settlements of europeans scattered thinly along the sea board|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0029.mp3|not to speak of the clergyman's health|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0030.mp3|so inadequate to sustain the hardships of a forest life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0031.mp3|his native gifts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0032.mp3|his culture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0034.mp3|the higher the state the more delicately adapted to it the man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0035.mp3|in furtherance of this choice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0036.mp3|it so happened that a ship lay in the harbour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0038.mp3|frequent at that day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0040.mp3|without being absolutely outlaws of the deep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0041.mp3|yet roamed over its surface with a remarkable irresponsibility of character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0042.mp3|this vessel had recently arrived from the spanish main|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0044.mp3|hester prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0046.mp3|as a self enlisted sister of charity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0047.mp3|had brought her acquainted with the captain and crew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0048.mp3|could take upon herself to secure the passage of two individuals and a child with all the secrecy which circumstances rendered more than desirable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0049.mp3|the minister had inquired of hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0050.mp3|with no little interest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0051.mp3|the precise time at which the vessel might be expected to depart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0052.mp3|it would probably be on the fourth day from the present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0055.mp3|why the reverend mister dimmesdale considered it so very fortunate we hesitate to reveal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0056.mp3|nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0057.mp3|to hold nothing back from the reader|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0058.mp3|it was because|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0059.mp3|on the third day from the present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0060.mp3|he was to preach the election sermon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0062.mp3|as such an occasion formed an honourable epoch in the life of a new england clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0063.mp3|he could not have chanced upon a more suitable mode and time of terminating his professional career|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0065.mp3|they shall say of me thought this exemplary man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0069.mp3|we have had and may still have worse things to tell of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0072.mp3|at once so slight and irrefragable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0073.mp3|of a subtle disease that had long since begun to eat into the real substance of his character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0075.mp3|for any considerable period|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0076.mp3|can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0077.mp3|without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0078.mp3|the excitement of mister dimmesdale's feelings as he returned from his interview with hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0079.mp3|lent him unaccustomed physical energy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0080.mp3|and hurried him townward at a rapid pace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0081.mp3|the pathway among the woods seemed wilder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0082.mp3|more uncouth with its rude natural obstacles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0084.mp3|than he remembered it on his outward journey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0085.mp3|but he leaped across the plashy places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0086.mp3|thrust himself through the clinging underbrush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0087.mp3|climbed the ascent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0088.mp3|plunged into the hollow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0089.mp3|and overcame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0090.mp3|in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0091.mp3|all the difficulties of the track|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0093.mp3|he could not but recall how feebly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0094.mp3|and with what frequent pauses for breath he had toiled over the same ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0095.mp3|only two days before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0096.mp3|as he drew near the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0097.mp3|he took an impression of change from the series of familiar objects that presented themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0098.mp3|it seemed not yesterday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0101.mp3|but many days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0102.mp3|or even years ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0103.mp3|since he had quitted them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0106.mp3|was each former trace of the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0107.mp3|as he remembered it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0108.mp3|and all the peculiarities of the houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0109.mp3|with the due multitude of gable peaks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0113.mp3|came this importunately obtrusive sense of change|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0114.mp3|the same was true as regarded the acquaintances whom he met|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0115.mp3|and all the well known shapes of human life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0116.mp3|about the little town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0117.mp3|they looked neither older nor younger now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0118.mp3|the beards of the aged were no whiter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0120.mp3|it was impossible to describe in what respect they differed from the individuals on whom he had so recently bestowed a parting glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0121.mp3|and yet the minister's deepest sense seemed to inform him of their mutability|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0122.mp3|a similar impression struck him most remarkably as he passed under the walls of his own church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0123.mp3|the edifice had so very strange|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0124.mp3|and yet so familiar an aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0126.mp3|either that he had seen it only in a dream hitherto|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0127.mp3|or that he was merely dreaming about it now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0128.mp3|this phenomenon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0129.mp3|in the various shapes which it assumed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0130.mp3|indicated no external change|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0131.mp3|but so sudden and important a change in the spectator of the familiar scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0132.mp3|that the intervening space of a single day had operated on his consciousness like the lapse of years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0133.mp3|the minister's own will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0134.mp3|and hester's will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0135.mp3|and the fate that grew between them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0136.mp3|had wrought this transformation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0137.mp3|it was the same town as heretofore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0138.mp3|but the same minister returned not from the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0139.mp3|he might have said to the friends who greeted him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0140.mp3|i am not the man for whom you take me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0141.mp3|i left him yonder in the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0142.mp3|withdrawn into a secret dell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0143.mp3|by a mossy tree trunk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0144.mp3|and near a melancholy brook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0146.mp3|seek your minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0147.mp3|and see if his emaciated figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0148.mp3|his thin cheek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0151.mp3|pain wrinkled brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0152.mp3|be not flung down there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0155.mp3|would still have insisted with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0156.mp3|thou art thyself the man but the error would have been their own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0158.mp3|before mister dimmesdale reached home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0159.mp3|his inner man gave him other evidences of a revolution in the sphere of thought and feeling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0162.mp3|in that interior kingdom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0163.mp3|was adequate to account for the impulses now communicated to the unfortunate and startled minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0164.mp3|at every step he was incited to do some strange|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0166.mp3|wicked thing or other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0167.mp3|with a sense that it would be at once involuntary and intentional|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0168.mp3|in spite of himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0170.mp3|for instance he met one of his own deacons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0171.mp3|the good old man addressed him with the paternal affection and patriarchal privilege which his venerable age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0172.mp3|his upright and holy character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0173.mp3|and his station in the church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0174.mp3|entitled him to use and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0175.mp3|conjoined with this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0176.mp3|the deep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0177.mp3|almost worshipping respect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0178.mp3|which the minister's professional and private claims alike demanded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0180.mp3|as from a lower social rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0181.mp3|and inferior order of endowment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0183.mp3|now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0184.mp3|during a conversation of some two or three moments between the reverend mister dimmesdale and this excellent and hoary bearded deacon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0185.mp3|it was only by the most careful self control that the former could refrain from uttering certain blasphemous suggestions that rose into his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0186.mp3|respecting the communion supper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0187.mp3|he absolutely trembled and turned pale as ashes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0188.mp3|lest his tongue should wag itself in utterance of these horrible matters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0189.mp3|and plead his own consent for so doing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0190.mp3|without his having fairly given it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0191.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0192.mp3|even with this terror in his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0193.mp3|he could hardly avoid laughing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0194.mp3|to imagine how the sanctified old patriarchal deacon would have been petrified by his minister's impiety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0195.mp3|again another incident of the same nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0196.mp3|hurrying along the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0197.mp3|the reverend mister dimmesdale encountered the eldest female member of his church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0198.mp3|a most pious and exemplary old dame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0202.mp3|and with a heart as full of reminiscences about her dead husband and children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0203.mp3|and her dead friends of long ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0204.mp3|as a burial ground is full of storied gravestones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0206.mp3|which would else have been such heavy sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0207.mp3|was made almost a solemn joy to her devout old soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0208.mp3|by religious consolations and the truths of scripture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0209.mp3|wherewith she had fed herself continually for more than thirty years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0210.mp3|and since mister dimmesdale had taken her in charge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0211.mp3|the good grandam's chief earthly comfort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0214.mp3|could have been none at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0215.mp3|was to meet her pastor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0217.mp3|or of set purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0218.mp3|and be refreshed with a word of warm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0220.mp3|heaven breathing gospel truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0221.mp3|from his beloved lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0225.mp3|on this occasion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0226.mp3|up to the moment of putting his lips to the old woman's ear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0227.mp3|mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0228.mp3|as the great enemy of souls would have it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0229.mp3|could recall no text of scripture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0230.mp3|nor aught else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0231.mp3|except a brief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0234.mp3|as it then appeared to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0235.mp3|unanswerable argument against the immortality of the human soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0238.mp3|as by the effect of an intensely poisonous infusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0239.mp3|what he really did whisper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0240.mp3|the minister could never afterwards recollect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0242.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0243.mp3|a fortunate disorder in his utterance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0245.mp3|or which providence interpreted after a method of its own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0247.mp3|as the minister looked back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0248.mp3|he beheld an expression of divine gratitude and ecstasy that seemed like the shine of the celestial city on her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0249.mp3|so wrinkled and ashy pale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0250.mp3|again a third instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0251.mp3|after parting from the old church member|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0252.mp3|he met the youngest sister of them all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0253.mp3|it was a maiden newly won|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0255.mp3|on the sabbath after his vigil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0256.mp3|to barter the transitory pleasures of the world for the heavenly hope that was to assume brighter substance as life grew dark around her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0257.mp3|and which would gild the utter gloom with final glory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0258.mp3|she was fair and pure as a lily that had bloomed in paradise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0259.mp3|the minister knew well that he was himself enshrined within the stainless sanctity of her heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0260.mp3|which hung its snowy curtains about his image|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0261.mp3|imparting to religion the warmth of love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0262.mp3|and to love a religious purity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0264.mp3|that afternoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0266.mp3|and thrown her into the pathway of this sorely tempted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0268.mp3|shall we not rather say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0269.mp3|this lost and desperate man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0270.mp3|as she drew nigh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0272.mp3|and drop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would be sure to blossom darkly soon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0273.mp3|and bear black fruit betimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0274.mp3|such was his sense of power over this virgin soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0275.mp3|trusting him as she did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0276.mp3|that the minister felt potent to blight all the field of innocence with but one wicked look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0277.mp3|and develop all its opposite with but a word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0279.mp3|with a mightier struggle than he had yet sustained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0280.mp3|he held his geneva cloak before his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0281.mp3|and hurried onward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0282.mp3|making no sign of recognition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0283.mp3|and leaving the young sister to digest his rudeness as she might|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0284.mp3|she ransacked her conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0285.mp3|which was full of harmless little matters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0287.mp3|and took herself to task poor thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0288.mp3|for a thousand imaginary faults|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0289.mp3|and went about her household duties with swollen eyelids the next morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0290.mp3|before the minister had time to celebrate his victory over this last temptation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0291.mp3|he was conscious of another impulse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0292.mp3|more ludicrous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0293.mp3|and almost as horrible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0295.mp3|we blush to tell it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0296.mp3|it was to stop short in the road|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0297.mp3|and teach some very wicked words to a knot of little puritan children who were playing there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0298.mp3|and had but just begun to talk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0299.mp3|denying himself this freak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0300.mp3|as unworthy of his cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0301.mp3|he met a drunken seaman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0303.mp3|and here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0306.mp3|and recreate himself with a few improper jests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0307.mp3|such as dissolute sailors so abound with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0313.mp3|it was not so much a better principle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0314.mp3|as partly his natural good taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0316.mp3|that carried him safely through the latter crisis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0317.mp3|what is it that haunts and tempts me thus cried the minister to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0319.mp3|pausing in the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0320.mp3|and striking his hand against his forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0322.mp3|or am i given over utterly to the fiend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0324.mp3|and sign it with my blood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0325.mp3|and does he now summon me to its fulfilment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0326.mp3|by suggesting the performance of every wickedness which his most foul imagination can conceive at the moment when the reverend mister dimmesdale thus communed with himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0327.mp3|and struck his forehead with his hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0328.mp3|old mistress hibbins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0329.mp3|the reputed witch lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0330.mp3|is said to have been passing by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0331.mp3|she made a very grand appearance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0332.mp3|having on a high head dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0333.mp3|a rich gown of velvet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0336.mp3|her especial friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0337.mp3|had taught her the secret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0338.mp3|before this last good lady had been hanged for sir thomas overbury's murder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0339.mp3|whether the witch had read the minister's thoughts or no|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0340.mp3|she came to a full stop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0341.mp3|looked shrewdly into his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0342.mp3|smiled craftily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0343.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0344.mp3|though little given to converse with clergymen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0345.mp3|began a conversation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0348.mp3|you have made a visit into the forest observed the witch lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0349.mp3|nodding her high head dress at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0350.mp3|the next time i pray you to allow me only a fair warning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0351.mp3|and i shall be proud to bear you company|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0354.mp3|madam answered the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0356.mp3|such as the lady's rank demanded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0357.mp3|and his own good breeding made imperative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0359.mp3|on my conscience and character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0361.mp3|i went not into the forest to seek a potentate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0363.mp3|at any future time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0364.mp3|design a visit thither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0366.mp3|my one sufficient object was to greet that pious friend of mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0371.mp3|still nodding her high head dress at the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0374.mp3|you carry it off like an old hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0375.mp3|but at midnight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0376.mp3|and in the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0377.mp3|we shall have other talk together she passed on with her aged stateliness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0378.mp3|but often turning back her head and smiling at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0380.mp3|have i then sold myself thought the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0381.mp3|to the fiend whom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0382.mp3|if men say true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0383.mp3|this yellow starched and velveted old hag has chosen for her prince and master the wretched minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0384.mp3|he had made a bargain very like it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0385.mp3|tempted by a dream of happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0386.mp3|he had yielded himself with deliberate choice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0387.mp3|as he had never done before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0388.mp3|to what he knew was deadly sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0389.mp3|and the infectious poison of that sin had been thus rapidly diffused throughout his moral system|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0390.mp3|it had stupefied all blessed impulses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0391.mp3|and awakened into vivid life the whole brotherhood of bad ones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0393.mp3|bitterness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0394.mp3|unprovoked malignity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0395.mp3|gratuitous desire of ill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0396.mp3|ridicule of whatever was good and holy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0397.mp3|all awoke to tempt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0398.mp3|even while they frightened him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0399.mp3|and his encounter with old mistress hibbins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0400.mp3|if it were a real incident|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0402.mp3|and the world of perverted spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0403.mp3|he had by this time reached his dwelling on the edge of the burial ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0405.mp3|hastening up the stairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0406.mp3|took refuge in his study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0408.mp3|without first betraying himself to the world by any of those strange and wicked eccentricities to which he had been continually impelled while passing through the streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0409.mp3|he entered the accustomed room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0410.mp3|and looked around him on its books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0411.mp3|its windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0414.mp3|with the same perception of strangeness that had haunted him throughout his walk from the forest dell into the town and thitherward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0415.mp3|here he had studied and written|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0416.mp3|here gone through fast and vigil and come forth half alive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0418.mp3|here borne a hundred thousand agonies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0419.mp3|there was the bible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0420.mp3|in its rich old hebrew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0421.mp3|with moses and the prophets speaking to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0422.mp3|and god's voice through all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0423.mp3|there on the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0425.mp3|was an unfinished sermon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0426.mp3|with a sentence broken in the midst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0427.mp3|where his thoughts had ceased to gush out upon the page two days before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0428.mp3|he knew that it was himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0429.mp3|the thin and white cheeked minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0430.mp3|who had done and suffered these things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0431.mp3|and written thus far into the election sermon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0432.mp3|but he seemed to stand apart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0434.mp3|but half envious curiosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0435.mp3|that self was gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0436.mp3|another man had returned out of the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0437.mp3|a wiser one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0438.mp3|with a knowledge of hidden mysteries which the simplicity of the former never could have reached|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0439.mp3|a bitter kind of knowledge that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0440.mp3|while occupied with these reflections|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0441.mp3|a knock came at the door of the study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0442.mp3|and the minister said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0444.mp3|not wholly devoid of an idea that he might behold an evil spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0445.mp3|and so he did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0447.mp3|the minister stood white and speechless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0448.mp3|with one hand on the hebrew scriptures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0449.mp3|and the other spread upon his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0451.mp3|reverend sir said the physician and how found you that godly man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0452.mp3|the apostle eliot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0453.mp3|but methinks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0455.mp3|you look pale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0456.mp3|as if the travel through the wilderness had been too sore for you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0458.mp3|i think not so rejoined the reverend mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0461.mp3|and the free air which i have breathed have done me good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0462.mp3|after so long confinement in my study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0463.mp3|i think to need no more of your drugs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0464.mp3|my kind physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0465.mp3|good though they be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0466.mp3|and administered by a friendly hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0467.mp3|all this time roger chillingworth was looking at the minister with the grave and intent regard of a physician towards his patient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0469.mp3|in spite of this outward show|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0470.mp3|the latter was almost convinced of the old man's knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0473.mp3|his confident suspicion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0474.mp3|with respect to his own interview with hester prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0475.mp3|the physician knew then that in the minister's regard he was no longer a trusted friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0476.mp3|but his bitterest enemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0477.mp3|so much being known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0478.mp3|it would appear natural that a part of it should be expressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0481.mp3|how long a time often passes before words embody things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0482.mp3|and with what security two persons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0483.mp3|who choose to avoid a certain subject|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0484.mp3|may approach its very verge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0485.mp3|and retire without disturbing it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0486.mp3|thus the minister felt no apprehension that roger chillingworth would touch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0487.mp3|in express words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0488.mp3|upon the real position which they sustained towards one another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0489.mp3|yet did the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0490.mp3|in his dark way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0491.mp3|creep frightfully near the secret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0496.mp3|the people look for great things from you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0497.mp3|apprehending that another year may come about and find their pastor gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0502.mp3|i hardly think to tarry with my flock through the flitting seasons of another year|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0503.mp3|but touching your medicine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0505.mp3|in my present frame of body i need it not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0506.mp3|i joy to hear it answered the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0507.mp3|it may be that my remedies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0508.mp3|so long administered in vain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0510.mp3|happy man were i|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0511.mp3|and well deserving of new england's gratitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0512.mp3|could i achieve this cure i thank you from my heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0513.mp3|most watchful friend said the reverend mister dimmesdale with a solemn smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0514.mp3|i thank you and can but requite your good deeds with my prayers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0516.mp3|as he took his leave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0518.mp3|they are the current gold coin of the new jerusalem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0519.mp3|with the king's own mint mark on them left alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0520.mp3|the minister summoned a servant of the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0521.mp3|and requested food|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0523.mp3|being set before him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0524.mp3|he ate with ravenous appetite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0525.mp3|then flinging the already written pages of the election sermon into the fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0526.mp3|he forthwith began another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0527.mp3|which he wrote with such an impulsive flow of thought and emotion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0528.mp3|that he fancied himself inspired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0529.mp3|and only wondered that heaven should see fit to transmit the grand and solemn music of its oracles through so foul an organ pipe as he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0530.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0531.mp3|leaving that mystery to solve itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0533.mp3|he drove his task onward with earnest haste and ecstasy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0534.mp3|thus the night fled away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0535.mp3|as if it were a winged steed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0536.mp3|and he careering on it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0537.mp3|morning came and peeped blushing through the curtains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0538.mp3|and at last sunrise threw a golden beam into the study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0539.mp3|and laid it right across the minister's bedazzled eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_20_hawthorne_0543.mp3|immeasurable tract of written space behind him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0001.mp3|hester prynne and little pearl came into the market place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0002.mp3|it was already thronged with the craftsmen and other plebeian inhabitants of the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0003.mp3|in considerable numbers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0004.mp3|among whom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0006.mp3|were many rough figures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0008.mp3|which surrounded the little metropolis of the colony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0009.mp3|on this public holiday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0010.mp3|as on all other occasions for seven years past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0011.mp3|hester was clad in a garment of coarse gray cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0012.mp3|not more by its hue than by some indescribable peculiarity in its fashion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0013.mp3|it had the effect of making her fade personally out of sight and outline|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0014.mp3|while again the scarlet letter brought her back from this twilight indistinctness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0015.mp3|and revealed her under the moral aspect of its own illumination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0016.mp3|her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0017.mp3|so long familiar to the townspeople|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0018.mp3|showed the marble quietude which they were accustomed to behold there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0019.mp3|it was like a mask|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0020.mp3|or rather like the frozen calmness of a dead woman's features|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0021.mp3|owing this dreary resemblance to the fact that hester was actually dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0022.mp3|in respect to any claim of sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0023.mp3|and had departed out of the world with which she still seemed to mingle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0025.mp3|on this one day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0026.mp3|that there was an expression unseen before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0029.mp3|vivid enough to be detected now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0030.mp3|unless some preternaturally gifted observer should have first read the heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0038.mp3|for one last time more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0039.mp3|encountered it freely and voluntarily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0040.mp3|in order to convert what had so long been agony into a kind of triumph|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0042.mp3|the people's victim and lifelong bond slave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0044.mp3|might say to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0045.mp3|yet a little while and she will be beyond your reach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0046.mp3|a few hours longer and the deep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0048.mp3|should we suppose a feeling of regret in hester's mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0049.mp3|at the moment when she was about to win her freedom from the pain which had been thus deeply incorporated with her being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0053.mp3|with which nearly all her years of womanhood had been perpetually flavoured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0054.mp3|the wine of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0055.mp3|henceforth to be presented to her lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0056.mp3|must be indeed rich|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0058.mp3|and exhilarating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0060.mp3|or else leave an inevitable and weary languor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0062.mp3|as with a cordial of intensest potency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0063.mp3|pearl was decked out with airy gaiety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0065.mp3|or that a fancy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0066.mp3|at once so gorgeous and so delicate as must have been requisite to contrive the child's apparel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0067.mp3|was the same that had achieved a task perhaps more difficult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0068.mp3|in imparting so distinct a peculiarity to hester's simple robe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0069.mp3|the dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0072.mp3|or inevitable development and outward manifestation of her character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0074.mp3|or the painted glory from the leaf of a bright flower|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0075.mp3|as with these so with the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0076.mp3|her garb was all of one idea with her nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0079.mp3|there was a certain singular inquietude and excitement in her mood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0080.mp3|resembling nothing so much as the shimmer of a diamond|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0081.mp3|that sparkles and flashes with the varied throbbings of the breast on which it is displayed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0082.mp3|children have always a sympathy in the agitations of those connected with them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0085.mp3|a sense of any trouble or impending revolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0086.mp3|of whatever kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0087.mp3|in domestic circumstances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0090.mp3|betrayed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0091.mp3|by the very dance of her spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0092.mp3|the emotions which none could detect in the marble passiveness of hester's brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0094.mp3|rather than walk by her mother's side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0095.mp3|she broke continually into shouts of a wild|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0097.mp3|and sometimes piercing music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0098.mp3|when they reached the market place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0099.mp3|she became still more restless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0100.mp3|on perceiving the stir and bustle that enlivened the spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0101.mp3|for it was usually more like the broad and lonesome green before a village meeting house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0102.mp3|than the centre of a town's business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0103.mp3|why what is this mother cried she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0104.mp3|wherefore have all the people left their work to day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0105.mp3|is it a play day for the whole world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0109.mp3|and looks as if he would gladly be merry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0110.mp3|if any kind body would only teach him how|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0111.mp3|and there is master brackett|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0113.mp3|nodding and smiling at me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0116.mp3|my child answered hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0118.mp3|the black grim ugly eyed old man said pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0120.mp3|for thou art clad in gray and wearest the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0124.mp3|and indians among them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0125.mp3|and sailors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0127.mp3|here in the market place they wait to see the procession pass said hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0128.mp3|for the governor and the magistrates are to go by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0129.mp3|and the ministers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0130.mp3|and all the great people and good people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0131.mp3|with the music and the soldiers marching before them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0132.mp3|and will the minister be there asked pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0133.mp3|and will he hold out both his hands to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0135.mp3|child answered her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0136.mp3|but he will not greet thee to day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0137.mp3|nor must thou greet him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0139.mp3|sad man is he said the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0140.mp3|as if speaking partly to herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0142.mp3|and holds thy hand and mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0143.mp3|as when we stood with him on the scaffold yonder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0144.mp3|and in the deep forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0145.mp3|where only the old trees can hear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0149.mp3|and he kisses my forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0151.mp3|so that the little brook would hardly wash it off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0154.mp3|in the sunny day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0155.mp3|and among all the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0156.mp3|he knows us not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0157.mp3|nor must we know him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0159.mp3|sad man is he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0160.mp3|with his hand always over his heart be quiet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0162.mp3|thou understandest not these things said her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0165.mp3|and see how cheery is everybody's face to day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0167.mp3|and the grown people from their workshops and their fields|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0168.mp3|on purpose to be happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0171.mp3|a new man is beginning to rule over them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0172.mp3|and so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0173.mp3|as has been the custom of mankind ever since a nation was first gathered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0174.mp3|they make merry and rejoice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0175.mp3|as if a good and golden year were at length to pass over the poor old world it was as hester said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0177.mp3|into this festal season of the year|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0178.mp3|as it already was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0179.mp3|and continued to be during the greater part of two centuries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0180.mp3|the puritans compressed whatever mirth and public joy they deemed allowable to human infirmity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0181.mp3|thereby so far dispelling the customary cloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0183.mp3|for the space of a single holiday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0184.mp3|they appeared scarcely more grave than most other communities at a period of general affliction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0186.mp3|which undoubtedly characterized the mood and manners of the age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0187.mp3|the persons now in the market place of boston had not been born to an inheritance of puritanic gloom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0188.mp3|they were native englishmen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0189.mp3|whose fathers had lived in the sunny richness of the elizabethan epoch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0190.mp3|a time when the life of england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0191.mp3|viewed as one great mass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0192.mp3|would appear to have been as stately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0195.mp3|as the world has ever witnessed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0196.mp3|had they followed their hereditary taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0197.mp3|the new england settlers would have illustrated all events of public importance by bonfires|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0201.mp3|nor would it have been impracticable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0202.mp3|in the observance of majestic ceremonies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0203.mp3|to combine mirthful recreation with solemnity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0204.mp3|and give|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0205.mp3|as it were|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0208.mp3|at such festivals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0210.mp3|there was some shadow of an attempt of this kind in the mode of celebrating the day on which the political year of the colony commenced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0214.mp3|might be traced in the customs which our forefathers instituted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0215.mp3|with reference to the annual installation of magistrates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0216.mp3|the fathers and founders of the commonwealth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0217.mp3|the statesman the priest and the soldier|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0220.mp3|in accordance with antique style|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0222.mp3|all came forth to move in procession before the people's eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0223.mp3|and thus impart a needed dignity to the simple framework of a government so newly constructed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0226.mp3|the people were countenanced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0227.mp3|if not encouraged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0228.mp3|in relaxing the severe and close application to their various modes of rugged industry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0229.mp3|which at all other times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0233.mp3|were none of the appliances which popular merriment would so readily have found in the england of elizabeth's time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0234.mp3|or that of james|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0237.mp3|with his harp and legendary ballad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0238.mp3|nor gleeman with an ape dancing to his music|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0241.mp3|to stir up the multitude with jests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0243.mp3|but still effective|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0244.mp3|by their appeals to the very broadest sources of mirthful sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0245.mp3|all such professors of the several branches of jocularity would have been sternly repressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0246.mp3|not only by the rigid discipline of law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0248.mp3|not the less however the great honest face of the people smiled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0249.mp3|grimly perhaps but widely too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0251.mp3|such as the colonists had witnessed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0255.mp3|and which it was thought well to keep alive on this new soil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0256.mp3|for the sake of the courage and manliness that were essential in them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0257.mp3|wrestling matches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0258.mp3|in the different fashions of cornwall and devonshire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0260.mp3|in one corner there was a friendly bout at quarterstaff|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0262.mp3|what attracted most interest of all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0263.mp3|on the platform of the pillory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0264.mp3|already so noted in our pages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0265.mp3|two masters of defence were commencing an exhibition with the buckler and broadsword|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0267.mp3|much to the disappointment of the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0269.mp3|who had no idea of permitting the majesty of the law to be violated by such an abuse of one of its consecrated places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0270.mp3|it may not be too much to affirm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0271.mp3|on the whole|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0272.mp3|the people being then in the first stages of joyless deportment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0273.mp3|and the offspring of sires who had known how to be merry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0276.mp3|in point of holiday keeping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0277.mp3|with their descendants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0278.mp3|even at so long an interval as ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0279.mp3|their immediate posterity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0280.mp3|the generation next to the early emigrants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0281.mp3|wore the blackest shade of puritanism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0282.mp3|and so darkened the national visage with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0283.mp3|that all the subsequent years have not sufficed to clear it up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0284.mp3|we have yet to learn again the forgotten art of gaiety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0285.mp3|the picture of human life in the market place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0286.mp3|though its general tint was the sad gray|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0288.mp3|or black of the english emigrants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0289.mp3|was yet enlivened by some diversity of hue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0290.mp3|a party of indians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0291.mp3|in their savage finery of curiously embroidered deerskin robes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0292.mp3|wampum belts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0294.mp3|and feathers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0295.mp3|and armed with the bow and arrow and stone headed spear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0296.mp3|stood apart with countenances of inflexible gravity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0297.mp3|beyond what even the puritan aspect could attain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0299.mp3|wild as were these painted barbarians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0301.mp3|this distinction could more justly be claimed by some mariners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0303.mp3|who had come ashore to see the humours of election day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0305.mp3|with sun blackened faces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0306.mp3|and an immensity of beard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0307.mp3|their wide short trousers were confined about the waist by belts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0308.mp3|often clasped with a rough plate of gold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0309.mp3|and sustaining always a long knife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0310.mp3|and in some instances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0312.mp3|from beneath their broad brimmed hats of palm leaf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0313.mp3|gleamed eyes which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0314.mp3|even in good nature and merriment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0315.mp3|had a kind of animal ferocity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0316.mp3|they transgressed without fear or scruple|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0317.mp3|the rules of behaviour that were binding on all others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0318.mp3|smoking tobacco under the beadle's very nose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0320.mp3|and quaffing at their pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0322.mp3|which they freely tendered to the gaping crowd around them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0324.mp3|rigid as we call it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0325.mp3|that a licence was allowed the seafaring class|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0326.mp3|not merely for their freaks on shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0327.mp3|but for far more desperate deeds on their proper element|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0328.mp3|the sailor of that day would go near to be arraigned as a pirate in our own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0329.mp3|there could be little doubt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0330.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0331.mp3|that this very ship's crew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0332.mp3|though no unfavourable specimens of the nautical brotherhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0333.mp3|had been guilty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0334.mp3|as we should phrase it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0335.mp3|of depredations on the spanish commerce|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0336.mp3|such as would have perilled all their necks in a modern court of justice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0339.mp3|and foamed very much at its own will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0340.mp3|or subject only to the tempestuous wind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0341.mp3|with hardly any attempts at regulation by human law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0342.mp3|the buccaneer on the wave might relinquish his calling and become at once if he chose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0343.mp3|a man of probity and piety on land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0345.mp3|even in the full career of his reckless life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0346.mp3|was he regarded as a personage with whom it was disreputable to traffic or casually associate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0347.mp3|thus the puritan elders in their black cloaks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0348.mp3|starched bands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0349.mp3|and steeple crowned hats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0352.mp3|the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0353.mp3|was seen to enter the market place in close and familiar talk with the commander of the questionable vessel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0354.mp3|the latter was by far the most showy and gallant figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0356.mp3|anywhere to be seen among the multitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0357.mp3|he wore a profusion of ribbons on his garment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0358.mp3|and gold lace on his hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0359.mp3|which was also encircled by a gold chain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0360.mp3|and surmounted with a feather|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0361.mp3|there was a sword at his side and a sword cut on his forehead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0363.mp3|by the arrangement of his hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0364.mp3|he seemed anxious rather to display than hide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0365.mp3|a landsman could hardly have worn this garb and shown this face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0367.mp3|without undergoing stern question before a magistrate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0369.mp3|or perhaps an exhibition in the stocks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0372.mp3|all was looked upon as pertaining to the character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0373.mp3|as to a fish his glistening scales|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0374.mp3|after parting from the physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0375.mp3|the commander of the bristol ship strolled idly through the market place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0376.mp3|until happening to approach the spot where hester prynne was standing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0378.mp3|and did not hesitate to address her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0379.mp3|as was usually the case wherever hester stood a small vacant area|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0380.mp3|a sort of magic circle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0381.mp3|had formed itself about her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0382.mp3|into which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0383.mp3|though the people were elbowing one another at a little distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0384.mp3|none ventured or felt disposed to intrude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0385.mp3|it was a forcible type of the moral solitude in which the scarlet letter enveloped its fated wearer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0386.mp3|partly by her own reserve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0387.mp3|and partly by the instinctive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0388.mp3|though no longer so unkindly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0389.mp3|withdrawal of her fellow creatures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0391.mp3|if never before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0392.mp3|it answered a good purpose by enabling hester and the seaman to speak together without risk of being overheard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0393.mp3|and so changed was hester prynne's repute before the public|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0398.mp3|mistress said the mariner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0400.mp3|no fear of scurvy or ship fever this voyage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0401.mp3|what with the ship's surgeon and this other doctor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0402.mp3|our only danger will be from drug or pill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0403.mp3|more by token|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0405.mp3|which i traded for with a spanish vessel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0406.mp3|what mean you inquired hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0407.mp3|startled more than she permitted to appear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0408.mp3|have you another passenger why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0409.mp3|know you not cried the shipmaster|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0410.mp3|that this physician here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0411.mp3|chillingworth he calls himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0414.mp3|for he tells me he is of your party|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0415.mp3|and a close friend to the gentleman you spoke of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0418.mp3|indeed replied hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0420.mp3|though in the utmost consternation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0421.mp3|they have long dwelt together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0423.mp3|but at that instant she beheld old roger chillingworth himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0424.mp3|standing in the remotest corner of the market place and smiling on her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0425.mp3|a smile which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0426.mp3|across the wide and bustling square|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0427.mp3|and through all the talk and laughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0428.mp3|and various thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0430.mp3|and interests of the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_21_hawthorne_0431.mp3|conveyed secret and fearful meaning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0000.mp3|before hester prynne could call together her thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0001.mp3|and consider what was practicable to be done in this new and startling aspect of affairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0002.mp3|the sound of military music was heard approaching along a contiguous street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0003.mp3|it denoted the advance of the procession of magistrates and citizens on its way towards the meeting house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0005.mp3|in compliance with a custom thus early established|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0006.mp3|and ever since observed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0007.mp3|the reverend mister dimmesdale was to deliver an election sermon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0008.mp3|soon the head of the procession showed itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0009.mp3|with a slow and stately march|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0011.mp3|and making its way across the market place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0012.mp3|first came the music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0013.mp3|it comprised a variety of instruments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0014.mp3|perhaps imperfectly adapted to one another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0015.mp3|and played with no great skill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0016.mp3|but yet attaining the great object for which the harmony of drum and clarion addresses itself to the multitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0017.mp3|that of imparting a higher and more heroic air to the scene of life that passes before the eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0019.mp3|but then lost for an instant the restless agitation that had kept her in a continual effervescence throughout the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0020.mp3|she gazed silently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0021.mp3|and seemed to be borne upward like a floating sea bird on the long heaves and swells of sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0022.mp3|but she was brought back to her former mood by the shimmer of the sunshine on the weapons and bright armour of the military company|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0023.mp3|which followed after the music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0024.mp3|and formed the honorary escort of the procession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0025.mp3|this body of soldiery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0026.mp3|which still sustains a corporate existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0027.mp3|and marches down from past ages with an ancient and honourable fame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0028.mp3|was composed of no mercenary materials|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0029.mp3|its ranks were filled with gentlemen who felt the stirrings of martial impulse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0030.mp3|and sought to establish a kind of college of arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0031.mp3|where|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0033.mp3|they might learn the science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0035.mp3|so far as peaceful exercise would teach them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0036.mp3|the practices of war|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0037.mp3|the high estimation then placed upon the military character might be seen in the lofty port of each individual member of the company|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0040.mp3|by their services in the low countries and on other fields of european warfare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0041.mp3|had fairly won their title to assume the name and pomp of soldiership|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0044.mp3|clad in burnished steel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0045.mp3|and with plumage nodding over their bright morions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0046.mp3|had a brilliancy of effect which no modern display can aspire to equal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0048.mp3|who came immediately behind the military escort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0051.mp3|if not absurd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0052.mp3|it was an age when what we call talent had far less consideration than now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0053.mp3|but the massive materials which produce stability and dignity of character a great deal more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0054.mp3|the people possessed by hereditary right the quality of reverence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0056.mp3|in their descendants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0057.mp3|if it survive at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0058.mp3|exists in smaller proportion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0059.mp3|and with a vastly diminished force in the selection and estimate of public men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0060.mp3|the change may be for good or ill and is partly perhaps for both|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0061.mp3|in that old day the english settler on these rude shores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0062.mp3|having left king|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0064.mp3|and all degrees of awful rank behind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0065.mp3|while still the faculty and necessity of reverence was strong in him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0066.mp3|bestowed it on the white hair and venerable brow of age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0067.mp3|on long tried integrity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0068.mp3|on solid wisdom and sad coloured experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0070.mp3|and comes under the general definition of respectability|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0071.mp3|these primitive statesmen therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0073.mp3|who were elevated to power by the early choice of the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0075.mp3|but distinguished by a ponderous sobriety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0076.mp3|rather than activity of intellect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0077.mp3|they had fortitude and self reliance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0078.mp3|and in time of difficulty or peril stood up for the welfare of the state like a line of cliffs against a tempestuous tide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0079.mp3|the traits of character here indicated were well represented in the square cast of countenance and large physical development of the new colonial magistrates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0080.mp3|so far as a demeanour of natural authority was concerned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0081.mp3|the mother country need not have been ashamed to see these foremost men of an actual democracy adopted into the house of peers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0083.mp3|next in order to the magistrates came the young and eminently distinguished divine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0084.mp3|from whose lips the religious discourse of the anniversary was expected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0085.mp3|his was the profession at that era in which intellectual ability displayed itself far more than in political life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0087.mp3|leaving a higher motive out of the question it offered inducements powerful enough in the almost worshipping respect of the community|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0088.mp3|to win the most aspiring ambition into its service|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0089.mp3|even political power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0091.mp3|was within the grasp of a successful priest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0092.mp3|it was the observation of those who beheld him now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0094.mp3|since mister dimmesdale first set his foot on the new england shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0096.mp3|there was no feebleness of step as at other times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0097.mp3|his frame was not bent nor did his hand rest ominously upon his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0098.mp3|yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0099.mp3|if the clergyman were rightly viewed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0100.mp3|his strength seemed not of the body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0102.mp3|it might be the exhilaration of that potent cordial which is distilled only in the furnace glow of earnest and long continued thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0104.mp3|and uplifted him on its ascending wave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0105.mp3|nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0106.mp3|so abstracted was his look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0107.mp3|it might be questioned whether mister dimmesdale even heard the music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0108.mp3|there was his body moving onward and with an unaccustomed force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0109.mp3|but where was his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0110.mp3|far and deep in its own region|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0111.mp3|busying itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0112.mp3|with preternatural activity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0114.mp3|and so he saw nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0115.mp3|heard nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0116.mp3|knew nothing of what was around him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0117.mp3|but the spiritual element took up the feeble frame and carried it along|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0118.mp3|unconscious of the burden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0119.mp3|and converting it to spirit like itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0120.mp3|men of uncommon intellect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0121.mp3|who have grown morbid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0122.mp3|possess this occasional power of mighty effort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0123.mp3|into which they throw the life of many days and then are lifeless for as many more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0125.mp3|gazing steadfastly at the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0126.mp3|felt a dreary influence come over her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0127.mp3|but wherefore or whence she knew not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0128.mp3|unless that he seemed so remote from her own sphere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0129.mp3|and utterly beyond her reach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0130.mp3|one glance of recognition she had imagined must needs pass between them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0131.mp3|she thought of the dim forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0132.mp3|with its little dell of solitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0133.mp3|and love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0134.mp3|and anguish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0135.mp3|and the mossy tree trunk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0137.mp3|sitting hand in hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0138.mp3|they had mingled their sad and passionate talk with the melancholy murmur of the brook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0139.mp3|how deeply had they known each other then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0140.mp3|and was this the man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0141.mp3|she hardly knew him now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0143.mp3|moving proudly past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0148.mp3|so unattainable in his worldly position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0150.mp3|through which she now beheld him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0151.mp3|her spirit sank with the idea that all must have been a delusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0152.mp3|and that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0153.mp3|vividly as she had dreamed it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0154.mp3|there could be no real bond betwixt the clergyman and herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0155.mp3|and thus much of woman was there in hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0156.mp3|that she could scarcely forgive him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0157.mp3|least of all now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0158.mp3|when the heavy footstep of their approaching fate might be heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0162.mp3|for being able so completely to withdraw himself from their mutual world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0163.mp3|while she groped darkly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0164.mp3|and stretched forth her cold hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0165.mp3|and found him not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0167.mp3|or herself felt the remoteness and intangibility that had fallen around the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0168.mp3|while the procession passed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0169.mp3|the child was uneasy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0170.mp3|fluttering up and down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0171.mp3|like a bird on the point of taking flight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0173.mp3|mother said she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0174.mp3|was that the same minister that kissed me by the brook hold thy peace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0177.mp3|i could not be sure that it was he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0178.mp3|so strange he looked continued the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0179.mp3|else i would have run to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0180.mp3|and bid him kiss me now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0182.mp3|even as he did yonder among the dark old trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0183.mp3|what would the minister have said mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0186.mp3|and bid me begone what should he say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0188.mp3|save that it was no time to kiss|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0189.mp3|and that kisses are not to be given in the market place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0192.mp3|that thou didst not speak to him another shade of the same sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0193.mp3|in reference to mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0194.mp3|was expressed by a person whose eccentricities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0197.mp3|to begin a conversation with the wearer of the scarlet letter in public|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0198.mp3|it was mistress hibbins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0200.mp3|arrayed in great magnificence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0203.mp3|a gown of rich velvet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0204.mp3|and a gold headed cane|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0205.mp3|had come forth to see the procession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0207.mp3|the crowd gave way before her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0208.mp3|and seemed to fear the touch of her garment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0209.mp3|as if it carried the plague among its gorgeous folds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0211.mp3|kindly as so many now felt towards the latter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0213.mp3|and caused a general movement from that part of the market place in which the two women stood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0215.mp3|what mortal imagination could conceive it whispered the old lady confidentially to hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0217.mp3|that saint on earth as the people uphold him to be and as|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0218.mp3|i must needs say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0219.mp3|he really looks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0222.mp3|that saw him pass in the procession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0223.mp3|would think how little while it is since he went forth out of his study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0224.mp3|chewing a hebrew text of scripture in his mouth i warrant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0225.mp3|to take an airing in the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0227.mp3|we know what that means hester prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0228.mp3|but truly forsooth i find it hard to believe him the same man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0229.mp3|many a church member saw i|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0230.mp3|walking behind the music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0231.mp3|that has danced in the same measure with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0232.mp3|when somebody was fiddler|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0234.mp3|it might be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0236.mp3|that is but a trifle when a woman knows the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0237.mp3|but this minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0238.mp3|couldst thou surely tell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0242.mp3|feeling mistress hibbins to be of infirm mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0244.mp3|it is not for me to talk lightly of a learned and pious minister of the word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0245.mp3|like the reverend mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0248.mp3|dost thou think i have been to the forest so many times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0249.mp3|and have yet no skill to judge who else has been there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0251.mp3|though no leaf of the wild garlands which they wore while they danced be left in their hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0252.mp3|i know thee hester for i behold the token|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0253.mp3|we may all see it in the sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0254.mp3|and it glows like a red flame in the dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0255.mp3|thou wearest it openly so there need be no question about that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0256.mp3|but this minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0257.mp3|let me tell thee in thine ear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0258.mp3|when the black man sees one of his own servants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0259.mp3|signed and sealed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0260.mp3|so shy of owning to the bond as is the reverend mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0263.mp3|to the eyes of all the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0265.mp3|with his hand always over his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0268.mp3|good mistress hibbins eagerly asked little pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0271.mp3|making pearl a profound reverence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0272.mp3|thou thyself wilt see it one time or another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0273.mp3|they say child thou art of the lineage of the prince of air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0276.mp3|the weird old gentlewoman took her departure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0277.mp3|by this time the preliminary prayer had been offered in the meeting house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0278.mp3|and the accents of the reverend mister dimmesdale were heard commencing his discourse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0280.mp3|as the sacred edifice was too much thronged to admit another auditor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0281.mp3|she took up her position close beside the scaffold of the pillory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0283.mp3|in the shape of an indistinct but varied murmur and flow of the minister's very peculiar voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0284.mp3|this vocal organ was in itself a rich endowment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0285.mp3|insomuch that a listener|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0286.mp3|comprehending nothing of the language in which the preacher spoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0287.mp3|might still have been swayed to and fro by the mere tone and cadence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0288.mp3|like all other music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0290.mp3|and emotions high or tender|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0291.mp3|in a tongue native to the human heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0292.mp3|wherever educated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0293.mp3|muffled as the sound was by its passage through the church walls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0295.mp3|and sympathized so intimately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0296.mp3|that the sermon had throughout a meaning for her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0297.mp3|entirely apart from its indistinguishable words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0300.mp3|if more distinctly heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0301.mp3|might have been only a grosser medium|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0302.mp3|and have clogged the spiritual sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0303.mp3|now she caught the low undertone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0304.mp3|as of the wind sinking down to repose itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0305.mp3|then ascended with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0306.mp3|as it rose through progressive gradations of sweetness and power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0307.mp3|until its volume seemed to envelop her with an atmosphere of awe and solemn grandeur|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0308.mp3|and yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0309.mp3|majestic as the voice sometimes became|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0310.mp3|there was for ever in it an essential character of plaintiveness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0311.mp3|a loud or low expression of anguish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0314.mp3|as it might be conceived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0315.mp3|of suffering humanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0316.mp3|that touched a sensibility in every bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0317.mp3|at times this deep strain of pathos was all that could be heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0318.mp3|and scarcely heard sighing amid a desolate silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0319.mp3|but even when the minister's voice grew high and commanding|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0321.mp3|when it assumed its utmost breadth and power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0322.mp3|so overfilling the church as to burst its way through the solid walls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0323.mp3|and diffuse itself in the open air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0325.mp3|if the auditor listened intently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0326.mp3|and for the purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0327.mp3|he could detect the same cry of pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0328.mp3|what was it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0330.mp3|sorrow laden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0331.mp3|perchance guilty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0332.mp3|telling its secret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0333.mp3|whether of guilt or sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0334.mp3|to the great heart of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0335.mp3|beseeching its sympathy or forgiveness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0336.mp3|at every moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0337.mp3|in each accent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0338.mp3|and never in vain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0339.mp3|it was this profound and continual undertone that gave the clergyman his most appropriate power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0340.mp3|during all this time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0341.mp3|hester stood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0343.mp3|at the foot of the scaffold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0344.mp3|if the minister's voice had not kept her there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0347.mp3|have been an inevitable magnetism in that spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0348.mp3|whence she dated the first hour of her life of ignominy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0349.mp3|there was a sense within her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0350.mp3|too ill defined to be made a thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0351.mp3|but weighing heavily on her mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0352.mp3|that her whole orb of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0353.mp3|both before and after|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0354.mp3|was connected with this spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0355.mp3|as with the one point that gave it unity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0358.mp3|had quitted her mother's side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0359.mp3|and was playing at her own will about the market place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0360.mp3|she made the sombre crowd cheerful by her erratic and glistening ray|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0361.mp3|even as a bird of bright plumage illuminates a whole tree of dusky foliage by darting to and fro|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0362.mp3|half seen and half concealed amid the twilight of the clustering leaves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0363.mp3|she had an undulating but oftentimes a sharp and irregular movement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0364.mp3|it indicated the restless vivacity of her spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0366.mp3|because it was played upon and vibrated with her mother's disquietude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0367.mp3|whenever pearl saw anything to excite her ever active and wandering curiosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0368.mp3|she flew thitherward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0370.mp3|as we might say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0371.mp3|seized upon that man or thing as her own property|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0372.mp3|so far as she desired it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0374.mp3|the puritans looked on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0375.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0376.mp3|if they smiled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0377.mp3|were none the less inclined to pronounce the child a demon offspring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0378.mp3|from the indescribable charm of beauty and eccentricity that shone through her little figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0379.mp3|and sparkled with its activity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0380.mp3|she ran and looked the wild indian in the face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0381.mp3|and he grew conscious of a nature wilder than his own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0383.mp3|with native audacity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0384.mp3|but still with a reserve as characteristic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0385.mp3|she flew into the midst of a group of mariners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0386.mp3|the swarthy cheeked wild men of the ocean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0387.mp3|as the indians were of the land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0389.mp3|as if a flake of the sea foam had taken the shape of a little maid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0391.mp3|that flashes beneath the prow in the night time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0394.mp3|who had spoken to hester prynne was so smitten with pearl's aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0395.mp3|that he attempted to lay hands upon her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0396.mp3|with purpose to snatch a kiss|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0397.mp3|finding it as impossible to touch her as to catch a humming bird in the air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0398.mp3|he took from his hat the gold chain that was twisted about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0403.mp3|it became a part of her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0404.mp3|and it was difficult to imagine her without it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0405.mp3|thy mother is yonder woman with the scarlet letter said the seaman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0408.mp3|then tell her rejoined he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0410.mp3|hump shouldered old doctor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0411.mp3|and he engages to bring his friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0413.mp3|aboard with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0415.mp3|wilt thou tell her this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0417.mp3|with a naughty smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0418.mp3|if thou callest me that ill name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0421.mp3|the child returned to her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0422.mp3|and communicated what the mariner had said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0425.mp3|at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0426.mp3|on beholding this dark and grim countenance of an inevitable doom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0428.mp3|showed itself with an unrelenting smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0429.mp3|right in the midst of their path|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0430.mp3|with her mind harassed by the terrible perplexity in which the shipmaster's intelligence involved her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0431.mp3|she was also subjected to another trial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0432.mp3|there were many people present from the country round about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0433.mp3|who had often heard of the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0434.mp3|and to whom it had been made terrific by a hundred false or exaggerated rumours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0435.mp3|but who had never beheld it with their own bodily eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0437.mp3|after exhausting other modes of amusement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0438.mp3|now thronged about hester prynne with rude and boorish intrusiveness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0439.mp3|unscrupulous as it was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0440.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0441.mp3|it could not bring them nearer than a circuit of several yards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0442.mp3|at that distance they accordingly stood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0444.mp3|the whole gang of sailors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0445.mp3|likewise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0446.mp3|observing the press of spectators|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0447.mp3|and learning the purport of the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0448.mp3|came and thrust their sunburnt and desperado looking faces into the ring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0449.mp3|even the indians were affected by a sort of cold shadow of the white man's curiosity and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0450.mp3|gliding through the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0451.mp3|fastened their snake like black eyes on hester's bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0454.mp3|that the wearer of this brilliantly embroidered badge must needs be a personage of high dignity among her people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0456.mp3|the inhabitants of the town their own interest in this worn out subject languidly reviving itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0457.mp3|by sympathy with what they saw others feel lounged idly to the same quarter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0459.mp3|perhaps more than all the rest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0461.mp3|well acquainted gaze at her familiar shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0463.mp3|who had awaited her forthcoming from the prison door seven years ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0464.mp3|all save one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0465.mp3|the youngest and only compassionate among them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0466.mp3|whose burial robe she had since made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0467.mp3|at the final hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0468.mp3|when she was so soon to fling aside the burning letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0469.mp3|it had strangely become the centre of more remark and excitement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0470.mp3|and was thus made to sear her breast more painfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0471.mp3|than at any time since the first day she put it on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0472.mp3|while hester stood in that magic circle of ignominy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0473.mp3|where the cunning cruelty of her sentence seemed to have fixed her for ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0474.mp3|the admirable preacher was looking down from the sacred pulpit upon an audience whose very inmost spirits had yielded to his control|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0475.mp3|the sainted minister in the church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_22_hawthorne_0477.mp3|what imagination would have been irreverent enough to surmise that the same scorching stigma was on them both|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0001.mp3|on which the souls of the listening audience had been borne aloft as on the swelling waves of the sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0002.mp3|at length came to a pause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0003.mp3|there was a momentary silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0004.mp3|profound as what should follow the utterance of oracles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0005.mp3|then ensued a murmur and half hushed tumult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0006.mp3|as if the auditors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0007.mp3|released from the high spell that had transported them into the region of another's mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0008.mp3|were returning into themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0009.mp3|with all their awe and wonder still heavy on them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0010.mp3|in a moment more the crowd began to gush forth from the doors of the church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0011.mp3|now that there was an end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0013.mp3|more fit to support the gross and earthly life into which they relapsed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0014.mp3|than that atmosphere which the preacher had converted into words of flame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0015.mp3|and had burdened with the rich fragrance of his thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0016.mp3|in the open air their rapture broke into speech|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0017.mp3|the street and the market place absolutely babbled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0018.mp3|from side to side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0019.mp3|with applauses of the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0020.mp3|his hearers could not rest until they had told one another of what each knew better than he could tell or hear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0021.mp3|according to their united testimony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0022.mp3|never had man spoken in so wise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0024.mp3|and so holy a spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0025.mp3|as he that spake this day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0026.mp3|nor had inspiration ever breathed through mortal lips more evidently than it did through his|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0027.mp3|its influence could be seen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0030.mp3|and possessing him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0031.mp3|and continually lifting him out of the written discourse that lay before him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0032.mp3|and filling him with ideas that must have been as marvellous to himself as to his audience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0033.mp3|his subject|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0035.mp3|had been the relation between the deity and the communities of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0036.mp3|with a special reference to the new england which they were here planting in the wilderness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0037.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0039.mp3|a spirit as of prophecy had come upon him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0040.mp3|constraining him to its purpose as mightily as the old prophets of israel were constrained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0041.mp3|only with this difference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0042.mp3|that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0043.mp3|whereas the jewish seers had denounced judgments and ruin on their country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0044.mp3|it was his mission to foretell a high and glorious destiny for the newly gathered people of the lord|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0046.mp3|throughout it all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0047.mp3|and through the whole discourse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0048.mp3|there had been a certain deep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0049.mp3|sad undertone of pathos|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0050.mp3|which could not be interpreted otherwise than as the natural regret of one soon to pass away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0052.mp3|their minister whom they so loved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0053.mp3|and who so loved them all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0054.mp3|that he could not depart heavenward without a sigh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0055.mp3|had the foreboding of untimely death upon him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0056.mp3|and would soon leave them in their tears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0057.mp3|this idea of his transitory stay on earth gave the last emphasis to the effect which the preacher had produced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0058.mp3|it was as if an angel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0059.mp3|in his passage to the skies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0060.mp3|had shaken his bright wings over the people for an instant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0061.mp3|at once a shadow and a splendour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0062.mp3|and had shed down a shower of golden truths upon them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0063.mp3|thus there had come to the reverend mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0065.mp3|in their various spheres|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0067.mp3|an epoch of life more brilliant and full of triumph than any previous one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0068.mp3|or than any which could hereafter be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0069.mp3|he stood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0070.mp3|at this moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0071.mp3|on the very proudest eminence of superiority|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0074.mp3|prevailing eloquence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0075.mp3|and a reputation of whitest sanctity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0076.mp3|could exalt a clergyman in new england's earliest days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0077.mp3|when the professional character was of itself a lofty pedestal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0078.mp3|such was the position which the minister occupied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0079.mp3|as he bowed his head forward on the cushions of the pulpit at the close of his election sermon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0080.mp3|meanwhile hester prynne was standing beside the scaffold of the pillory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0081.mp3|with the scarlet letter still burning on her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0083.mp3|and the measured tramp of the military escort issuing from the church door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0088.mp3|the train of venerable and majestic fathers were seen moving through a broad pathway of the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0089.mp3|who drew back reverently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0090.mp3|on either side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0091.mp3|as the governor and magistrates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0092.mp3|the old and wise men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0093.mp3|the holy ministers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0094.mp3|and all that were eminent and renowned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0095.mp3|advanced into the midst of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0097.mp3|their presence was greeted by a shout|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0100.mp3|was felt to be an irrepressible outburst of enthusiasm kindled in the auditors by that high strain of eloquence which was yet reverberating in their ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0101.mp3|each felt the impulse in himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0102.mp3|and in the same breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0103.mp3|caught it from his neighbour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0104.mp3|within the church it had hardly been kept down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0105.mp3|beneath the sky it pealed upward to the zenith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0106.mp3|there were human beings enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0107.mp3|and enough of highly wrought and symphonious feeling to produce that more impressive sound than the organ tones of the blast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0108.mp3|or the thunder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0109.mp3|or the roar of the sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0110.mp3|even that mighty swell of many voices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0111.mp3|blended into one great voice by the universal impulse which makes likewise one vast heart out of the many|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0112.mp3|never from the soil of new england had gone up such a shout|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0115.mp3|how fared it with him then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0119.mp3|did his footsteps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0120.mp3|in the procession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0121.mp3|really tread upon the dust of earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0122.mp3|as the ranks of military men and civil fathers moved onward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0123.mp3|all eyes were turned towards the point where the minister was seen to approach among them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0124.mp3|the shout died into a murmur|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0125.mp3|as one portion of the crowd after another obtained a glimpse of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0126.mp3|how feeble and pale he looked amid all his triumph|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0130.mp3|the inspiration which had held him up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0131.mp3|until he should have delivered the sacred message that had brought its own strength along with it from heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0132.mp3|was withdrawn now that it had so faithfully performed its office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0134.mp3|which they had just before beheld burning on his cheek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0135.mp3|was extinguished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0136.mp3|like a flame that sinks down hopelessly among the late decaying embers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0138.mp3|it was hardly a man with life in him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0141.mp3|and did not fall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0142.mp3|one of his clerical brethren|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0143.mp3|it was the venerable john wilson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0144.mp3|observing the state in which mister dimmesdale was left by the retiring wave of intellect and sensibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0145.mp3|stepped forward hastily to offer his support|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0146.mp3|the minister tremulously but decidedly repelled the old man's arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0147.mp3|he still walked onward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0148.mp3|if that movement could be so described|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0149.mp3|which rather resembled the wavering effort of an infant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0150.mp3|with its mother's arms in view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0151.mp3|outstretched to tempt him forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0152.mp3|and now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0153.mp3|almost imperceptible as were the latter steps of his progress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0154.mp3|he had come opposite the well remembered and weather darkened scaffold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0156.mp3|long since|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0157.mp3|with all that dreary lapse of time between|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0159.mp3|there stood hester holding little pearl by the hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0160.mp3|and there was the scarlet letter on her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0161.mp3|the minister here made a pause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0162.mp3|although the music still played the stately and rejoicing march to which the procession moved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0164.mp3|but here he made a pause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0165.mp3|bellingham for the last few moments had kept an anxious eye upon him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0166.mp3|he now left his own place in the procession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0167.mp3|and advanced to give assistance judging|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0168.mp3|from mister dimmesdale's aspect that he must otherwise inevitably fall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0169.mp3|but there was something in the latter's expression that warned back the magistrate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0170.mp3|although a man not readily obeying the vague intimations that pass from one spirit to another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0172.mp3|this earthly faintness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0175.mp3|only another phase of the minister's celestial strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0176.mp3|nor would it have seemed a miracle too high to be wrought for one so holy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0177.mp3|had he ascended before their eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0178.mp3|waxing dimmer and brighter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0179.mp3|and fading at last into the light of heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0180.mp3|he turned towards the scaffold and stretched forth his arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0181.mp3|hester said he come hither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0184.mp3|but there was something at once tender and strangely triumphant in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0185.mp3|the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0187.mp3|which was one of her characteristics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0188.mp3|flew to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0189.mp3|and clasped her arms about his knees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0192.mp3|as if impelled by inevitable fate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0193.mp3|and against her strongest will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0194.mp3|likewise drew near but paused before she reached him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0195.mp3|at this instant old roger chillingworth thrust himself through the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0197.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0200.mp3|and evil was his look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0201.mp3|he rose up out of some nether region|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0202.mp3|to snatch back his victim from what he sought to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0203.mp3|be that as it might|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0206.mp3|madman hold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0207.mp3|what is your purpose whispered he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0208.mp3|wave back that woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0209.mp3|cast off this child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0210.mp3|all shall be well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0211.mp3|do not blacken your fame and perish in dishonour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0212.mp3|i can yet save you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0213.mp3|would you bring infamy on your sacred profession ha tempter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0214.mp3|methinks thou art too late answered the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0215.mp3|encountering his eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0218.mp3|thy power is not what it was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0219.mp3|with god's help|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0220.mp3|i shall escape thee now he again extended his hand to the woman of the scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0222.mp3|with a piercing earnestness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0223.mp3|in the name of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0224.mp3|so terrible and so merciful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0225.mp3|who gives me grace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0226.mp3|at this last moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0227.mp3|to do what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0228.mp3|for my own heavy sin and miserable agony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0229.mp3|i withheld myself from doing seven years ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0230.mp3|come hither now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0231.mp3|and twine thy strength about me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0232.mp3|thy strength hester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0233.mp3|but let it be guided by the will which god hath granted me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0234.mp3|this wretched and wronged old man is opposing it with all his might|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0236.mp3|come hester come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0238.mp3|the crowd was in a tumult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0239.mp3|the men of rank and dignity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0242.mp3|and so perplexed as to the purport of what they saw|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0243.mp3|unable to receive the explanation which most readily presented itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0244.mp3|or to imagine any other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0246.mp3|they beheld the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0247.mp3|leaning on hester's shoulder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0248.mp3|and supported by her arm around him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0251.mp3|while still the little hand of the sin born child was clasped in his|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0253.mp3|as one intimately connected with the drama of guilt and sorrow in which they had all been actors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0255.mp3|therefore to be present at its closing scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0256.mp3|hadst thou sought the whole earth over said he looking darkly at the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0257.mp3|there was no one place so secret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0258.mp3|no high place nor lowly place where thou couldst have escaped me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0259.mp3|save on this very scaffold thanks be to him who hath led me hither answered the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0260.mp3|yet he trembled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0263.mp3|not the less evidently betrayed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0264.mp3|that there was a feeble smile upon his lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0265.mp3|is not this better murmured he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0266.mp3|than what we dreamed of in the forest i know not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0267.mp3|i know not she hurriedly replied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0268.mp3|better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0270.mp3|so we may both die|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0271.mp3|and little pearl die with us for thee and pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0272.mp3|be it as god shall order said the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0273.mp3|and god is merciful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0274.mp3|let me now do the will which he hath made plain before my sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0278.mp3|the reverend mister dimmesdale turned to the dignified and venerable rulers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0279.mp3|to the holy ministers who were his brethren|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0280.mp3|to the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0281.mp3|whose great heart was thoroughly appalled yet overflowing with tearful sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0282.mp3|as knowing that some deep life matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0283.mp3|which if full of sin was full of anguish and repentance likewise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0284.mp3|was now to be laid open to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0286.mp3|but little past its meridian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0287.mp3|shone down upon the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0288.mp3|and gave a distinctness to his figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0289.mp3|as he stood out from all the earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0290.mp3|to put in his plea of guilty at the bar of eternal justice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0291.mp3|people of new england cried he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0292.mp3|with a voice that rose over them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0296.mp3|yet had always a tremor through it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0297.mp3|and sometimes a shriek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0298.mp3|struggling up out of a fathomless depth of remorse and woe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0299.mp3|ye that have loved me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0300.mp3|ye that have deemed me holy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0301.mp3|behold me here the one sinner of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0302.mp3|at last at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0303.mp3|i stand upon the spot where|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0304.mp3|seven years since|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0305.mp3|i should have stood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0308.mp3|whose arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0309.mp3|more than the little strength wherewith i have crept hitherward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0310.mp3|sustains me at this dreadful moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0311.mp3|from grovelling down upon my face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0312.mp3|lo the scarlet letter which hester wears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0313.mp3|ye have all shuddered at it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0314.mp3|wherever her walk hath been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0316.mp3|it hath cast a lurid gleam of awe and horrible repugnance round about her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0317.mp3|but there stood one in the midst of you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0318.mp3|at whose brand of sin and infamy ye have not shuddered it seemed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0319.mp3|at this point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0320.mp3|as if the minister must leave the remainder of his secret undisclosed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0321.mp3|but he fought back the bodily weakness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0322.mp3|and still more the faintness of heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0323.mp3|that was striving for the mastery with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0324.mp3|he threw off all assistance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0326.mp3|it was on him he continued with a kind of fierceness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0328.mp3|god's eye beheld it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0330.mp3|the devil knew it well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0331.mp3|and fretted it continually with the touch of his burning finger but he hid it cunningly from men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0335.mp3|and sad because he missed his heavenly kindred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0336.mp3|now at the death hour he stands up before you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0337.mp3|he bids you look again at hester's scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0340.mp3|with all its mysterious horror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0341.mp3|it is but the shadow of what he bears on his own breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0342.mp3|and that even this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0343.mp3|his own red stigma|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0344.mp3|is no more than the type of what has seared his inmost heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0345.mp3|stand any here that question god's judgment on a sinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0349.mp3|he tore away the ministerial band from before his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0350.mp3|it was revealed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0351.mp3|but it were irreverent to describe that revelation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0352.mp3|for an instant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0353.mp3|the gaze of the horror stricken multitude was concentrated on the ghastly miracle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0354.mp3|while the minister stood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0355.mp3|with a flush of triumph in his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0361.mp3|old roger chillingworth knelt down beside him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0363.mp3|dull countenance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0364.mp3|out of which the life seemed to have departed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0365.mp3|thou hast escaped me he repeated more than once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0366.mp3|thou hast escaped me may god forgive thee said the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0370.mp3|and fixed them on the woman and the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0371.mp3|my little pearl said he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0372.mp3|feebly and there was a sweet and gentle smile over his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0373.mp3|as of a spirit sinking into deep repose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0375.mp3|now that the burden was removed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0377.mp3|dear little pearl wilt thou kiss me now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0378.mp3|thou wouldst not yonder in the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0379.mp3|but now thou wilt pearl kissed his lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0381.mp3|the great scene of grief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0382.mp3|in which the wild infant bore a part had developed all her sympathies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0383.mp3|and as her tears fell upon her father's cheek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0384.mp3|they were the pledge that she would grow up amid human joy and sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0385.mp3|nor forever do battle with the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0386.mp3|but be a woman in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0390.mp3|hester said the clergyman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0391.mp3|farewell shall we not meet again whispered she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0392.mp3|bending her face down close to his|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0393.mp3|shall we not spend our immortal life together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0394.mp3|surely surely we have ransomed one another with all this woe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0395.mp3|thou lookest far into eternity with those bright dying eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0397.mp3|hush said he with tremulous solemnity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0398.mp3|the law we broke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0400.mp3|let these alone be in thy thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0401.mp3|i fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0402.mp3|i fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0403.mp3|it may be that when we forgot our god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0404.mp3|when we violated our reverence each for the other's soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0405.mp3|it was thenceforth vain to hope that we could meet hereafter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0406.mp3|in an everlasting and pure reunion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0407.mp3|god knows and he is merciful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0408.mp3|he hath proved his mercy most of all in my afflictions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0409.mp3|by giving me this burning torture to bear upon my breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0412.mp3|by bringing me hither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0413.mp3|to die this death of triumphant ignominy before the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0416.mp3|his will be done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0417.mp3|farewell that final word came forth with the minister's expiring breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0418.mp3|the multitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0419.mp3|silent till then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0421.mp3|deep voice of awe and wonder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0422.mp3|which could not as yet find utterance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_23_hawthorne_0423.mp3|save in this murmur that rolled so heavily after the departed spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0000.mp3|after many days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0001.mp3|when time sufficed for the people to arrange their thoughts in reference to the foregoing scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0002.mp3|there was more than one account of what had been witnessed on the scaffold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0003.mp3|most of the spectators testified to having seen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0004.mp3|on the breast of the unhappy minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0005.mp3|a scarlet letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0007.mp3|imprinted in the flesh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0008.mp3|as regarded its origin there were various explanations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0009.mp3|all of which must necessarily have been conjectural|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0010.mp3|some affirmed that the reverend mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0011.mp3|on the very day when hester prynne first wore her ignominious badge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0012.mp3|had begun a course of penance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0013.mp3|which he afterwards in so many futile methods followed out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0014.mp3|by inflicting a hideous torture on himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0015.mp3|others contended that the stigma had not been produced until a long time subsequent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0016.mp3|when old roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0017.mp3|being a potent necromancer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0018.mp3|had caused it to appear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0022.mp3|and the wonderful operation of his spirit upon the body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0023.mp3|whispered their belief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0024.mp3|that the awful symbol was the effect of the ever active tooth of remorse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0026.mp3|and at last manifesting heaven's dreadful judgment by the visible presence of the letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0027.mp3|the reader may choose among these theories|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0028.mp3|we have thrown all the light we could acquire upon the portent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0029.mp3|and would gladly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0030.mp3|now that it has done its office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0032.mp3|where long meditation has fixed it in very undesirable distinctness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0033.mp3|it is singular|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0034.mp3|nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0035.mp3|that certain persons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0036.mp3|who were spectators of the whole scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0037.mp3|and professed never once to have removed their eyes from the reverend mister dimmesdale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0038.mp3|denied that there was any mark whatever on his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0041.mp3|by their report|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0043.mp3|nor even remotely implied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0044.mp3|any|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0048.mp3|according to these highly respectable witnesses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0049.mp3|the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0050.mp3|conscious that he was dying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0053.mp3|that the reverence of the multitude placed him already among saints and angels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0054.mp3|had desired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0055.mp3|by yielding up his breath in the arms of that fallen woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0057.mp3|after exhausting life in his efforts for mankind's spiritual good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0059.mp3|in order to impress on his admirers the mighty and mournful lesson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0061.mp3|in the view of infinite purity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0062.mp3|we are sinners all alike|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0063.mp3|it was to teach them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0065.mp3|and repudiate more utterly the phantom of human merit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0066.mp3|which would look aspiringly upward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0067.mp3|without disputing a truth so momentous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0068.mp3|we must be allowed to consider this version of mister dimmesdale's story as only an instance of that stubborn fidelity with which a man's friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0069.mp3|and especially a clergyman's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0070.mp3|will sometimes uphold his character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0073.mp3|establish him a false and sin stained creature of the dust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0074.mp3|the authority which we have chiefly followed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0075.mp3|a manuscript of old date|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0076.mp3|drawn up from the verbal testimony of individuals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0077.mp3|some of whom had known hester prynne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0078.mp3|while others had heard the tale from contemporary witnesses fully confirms the view taken in the foregoing pages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0079.mp3|among many morals which press upon us from the poor minister's miserable experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0080.mp3|we put only this into a sentence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0082.mp3|be true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0083.mp3|be true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0084.mp3|show freely to the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0085.mp3|if not your worst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0086.mp3|yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred nothing was more remarkable than the change which took place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0087.mp3|almost immediately after mister dimmesdale's death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0088.mp3|in the appearance and demeanour of the old man known as roger chillingworth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0089.mp3|all his strength and energy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0091.mp3|seemed at once to desert him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0092.mp3|insomuch that he positively withered up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0093.mp3|shrivelled away and almost vanished from mortal sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0094.mp3|like an uprooted weed that lies wilting in the sun|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0095.mp3|this unhappy man had made the very principle of his life to consist in the pursuit and systematic exercise of revenge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0096.mp3|and when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0100.mp3|there was no more devil's work on earth for him to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0102.mp3|and pay him his wages duly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0103.mp3|but to all these shadowy beings so long our near acquaintances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0104.mp3|as well roger chillingworth as his companions we would fain be merciful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0105.mp3|it is a curious subject of observation and inquiry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0106.mp3|whether hatred and love be not the same thing at bottom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0108.mp3|in its utmost development|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0109.mp3|supposes a high degree of intimacy and heart knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0112.mp3|or the no less passionate hater|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0113.mp3|forlorn and desolate by the withdrawal of his subject|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0114.mp3|philosophically considered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0115.mp3|therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0116.mp3|the two passions seem essentially the same|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0117.mp3|except that one happens to be seen in a celestial radiance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0118.mp3|and the other in a dusky and lurid glow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0119.mp3|in the spiritual world the old physician and the minister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0120.mp3|mutual victims as they have been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0122.mp3|unawares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0123.mp3|have found their earthly stock of hatred and antipathy transmuted into golden love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0124.mp3|leaving this discussion apart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0125.mp3|we have a matter of business to communicate to the reader|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0127.mp3|which took place within the year|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0128.mp3|and by his last will and testament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0129.mp3|of which governor bellingham and the reverend mister wilson were executors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0130.mp3|he bequeathed a very considerable amount of property|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0131.mp3|both here and in england to little pearl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0134.mp3|the elf child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0135.mp3|the demon offspring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0136.mp3|as some people up to that epoch persisted in considering her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0137.mp3|became the richest heiress of her day in the new world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0138.mp3|not improbably this circumstance wrought a very material change in the public estimation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0139.mp3|and had the mother and child remained here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0140.mp3|little pearl at a marriageable period of life might have mingled her wild blood with the lineage of the devoutest puritan among them all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0141.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0142.mp3|in no long time after the physician's death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0143.mp3|the wearer of the scarlet letter disappeared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0145.mp3|for many years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0146.mp3|though a vague report would now and then find its way across the sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0147.mp3|like a shapeless piece of driftwood tossed ashore with the initials of a name upon it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0148.mp3|yet no tidings of them unquestionably authentic were received|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0149.mp3|the story of the scarlet letter grew into a legend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0153.mp3|and kept the scaffold awful where the poor minister had died|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0155.mp3|near this latter spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0156.mp3|one afternoon some children were at play|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0158.mp3|in all those years it had never once been opened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0159.mp3|but either she unlocked it or the decaying wood and iron yielded to her hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0160.mp3|or she glided shadow like through these impediments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0161.mp3|and at all events went in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0162.mp3|on the threshold she paused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0163.mp3|turned partly round|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0165.mp3|the home of so intense a former life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0166.mp3|was more dreary and desolate than even she could bear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0167.mp3|but her hesitation was only for an instant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0168.mp3|though long enough to display a scarlet letter on her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0171.mp3|if still alive she must now have been in the flush and bloom of early womanhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0173.mp3|nor ever learned with the fulness of perfect certainty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0174.mp3|whether the elf child had gone thus untimely to a maiden grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0176.mp3|rich nature had been softened and subdued and made capable of a woman's gentle happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0180.mp3|though of bearings unknown to english heraldry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0181.mp3|in the cottage there were articles of comfort and luxury such as hester never cared to use|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0182.mp3|but which only wealth could have purchased and affection have imagined for her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0183.mp3|there were trifles too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0184.mp3|little ornaments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0185.mp3|beautiful tokens of a continual remembrance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0186.mp3|that must have been wrought by delicate fingers at the impulse of a fond heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0195.mp3|faithfully believes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0197.mp3|but married|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0198.mp3|and happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0199.mp3|and mindful of her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0200.mp3|and that she would most joyfully have entertained that sad and lonely mother at her fireside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0203.mp3|in new england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0204.mp3|than in that unknown region where pearl had found a home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0205.mp3|here had been her sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0206.mp3|here her sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9288/scarletletter_24_hawthorne_0207.mp3|and here was yet to be her penitence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0001.mp3|is there not ground for suspecting that all philosophers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0002.mp3|in so far as they have been dogmatists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0003.mp3|have failed to understand women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0004.mp3|that the terrible seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid their addresses to truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0005.mp3|have been unskilled and unseemly methods for winning a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0006.mp3|certainly she has never allowed herself to be won|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0007.mp3|and at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0008.mp3|if indeed it stands at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0009.mp3|for there are scoffers who maintain that it has fallen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0010.mp3|that all dogma lies on the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0011.mp3|nay more that it is at its last gasp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0012.mp3|but to speak seriously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0013.mp3|there are good grounds for hoping that all dogmatizing in philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0014.mp3|whatever solemn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0015.mp3|whatever conclusive and decided airs it has assumed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0017.mp3|and probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood what has actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have hitherto reared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0019.mp3|which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0020.mp3|in the form of subject|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0021.mp3|and ego superstition has not yet ceased doing mischief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0022.mp3|perhaps some play upon words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0023.mp3|a deception on the part of grammar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0024.mp3|or an audacious generalization of very restricted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0025.mp3|very personal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0026.mp3|very human|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0028.mp3|the philosophy of the dogmatists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0029.mp3|it is to be hoped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0030.mp3|was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0031.mp3|as was astrology in still earlier times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0032.mp3|in the service of which probably more labour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0036.mp3|we owe to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0038.mp3|the grand style of architecture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0039.mp3|it seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with everlasting claims|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0041.mp3|dogmatic philosophy has been a caricature of this kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0043.mp3|let us not be ungrateful to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0044.mp3|although it must certainly be confessed that the worst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0045.mp3|the most tiresome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0046.mp3|and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist error|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0047.mp3|namely plato's invention of pure spirit and the good in itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0048.mp3|but now when it has been surmounted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0049.mp3|when europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0050.mp3|rid of this nightmare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0055.mp3|it amounted to the very inversion of truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0056.mp3|and the denial of the perspective|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0057.mp3|the fundamental condition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0058.mp3|of life to speak of spirit and the good as plato spoke of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0059.mp3|indeed one might ask as a physician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0060.mp3|how did such a malady attack that finest product of antiquity plato|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0061.mp3|had the wicked socrates really corrupted him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0063.mp3|and deserved his hemlock but the struggle against plato|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0065.mp3|to speak plainer and for the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0066.mp3|the struggle against the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of christianity for christianity is platonism for the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0067.mp3|produced in europe a magnificent tension of soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0068.mp3|such as had not existed anywhere previously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0069.mp3|with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0070.mp3|as a matter of fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0071.mp3|the european feels this tension as a state of distress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0072.mp3|and twice attempts have been made in grand style to unbend the bow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0073.mp3|once by means of jesuitism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0074.mp3|and the second time by means of democratic enlightenment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0076.mp3|with the aid of liberty of the press and newspaper reading|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0078.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0080.mp3|the germans invented gunpowder all credit to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0081.mp3|but they again made things square they invented printing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0082.mp3|but we|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0084.mp3|nor democrats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0085.mp3|nor even sufficiently germans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0088.mp3|very free spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0089.mp3|we have it still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_00_nietzsche_0091.mp3|and perhaps also the arrow the duty and who knows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0000.mp3|the will to truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0001.mp3|which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0002.mp3|the famous truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with respect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0003.mp3|what questions has this will to truth not laid before us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0004.mp3|what strange perplexing questionable questions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0005.mp3|it is already a long story|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0006.mp3|yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0007.mp3|is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0009.mp3|and turn impatiently away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0010.mp3|that this sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0011.mp3|who is it really that puts questions to us here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0013.mp3|in fact we made a long halt at the question as to the origin of this will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0014.mp3|until at last we came to an absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0015.mp3|we inquired about the value of this will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0016.mp3|granted that we want the truth why not rather untruth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0017.mp3|and uncertainty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0018.mp3|even ignorance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0019.mp3|the problem of the value of truth presented itself before us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0020.mp3|or was it we who presented ourselves before the problem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0022.mp3|which the sphinx|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0023.mp3|it would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0024.mp3|and could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0025.mp3|as if we were the first to discern it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0026.mp3|get a sight of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0027.mp3|and risk raising it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0028.mp3|for there is risk in raising it perhaps there is no greater risk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0029.mp3|how could anything originate out of its opposite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0030.mp3|for example truth out of error|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0031.mp3|or the will to truth out of the will to deception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0032.mp3|or the generous deed out of selfishness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0034.mp3|such genesis is impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0035.mp3|whoever dreams of it is a fool nay worse than a fool|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0036.mp3|things of the highest value must have a different origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0037.mp3|an origin of their own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0038.mp3|in this transitory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0042.mp3|in this turmoil of delusion and cupidity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0043.mp3|they cannot have their source|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0044.mp3|but rather in the lap of being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0046.mp3|in the concealed god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0048.mp3|there must be their source and nowhere else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0049.mp3|this mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which metaphysicians of all times can be recognized|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0050.mp3|this mode of valuation is at the back of all their logical procedure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0051.mp3|through this belief of theirs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0052.mp3|they exert themselves for their knowledge for something that is in the end solemnly christened the truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0055.mp3|was most necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0056.mp3|though they had made a solemn vow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0059.mp3|whether antitheses exist at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0060.mp3|and secondly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0061.mp3|whether the popular valuations and antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their seal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0062.mp3|are not perhaps merely superficial estimates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0063.mp3|merely provisional perspectives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0064.mp3|besides being probably made from some corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0065.mp3|perhaps from below|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0066.mp3|frog perspectives as it were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0067.mp3|to borrow an expression current among painters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0068.mp3|in spite of all the value which may belong to the true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0070.mp3|and the unselfish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0071.mp3|it might be possible that a higher and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to pretence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0072.mp3|to the will to delusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0074.mp3|and cupidity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0075.mp3|it might even be possible that what constitutes the value of those good and respected things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0076.mp3|consists precisely in their being insidiously related|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0078.mp3|and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0079.mp3|perhaps even in being essentially identical with them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0080.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0081.mp3|but who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous perhapses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0082.mp3|for that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of philosophers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0083.mp3|such as will have other tastes and inclinations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0084.mp3|the reverse of those hitherto prevalent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0085.mp3|philosophers of the dangerous perhaps in every sense of the term|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0086.mp3|and to speak in all seriousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0087.mp3|i see such new philosophers beginning to appear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0088.mp3|having kept a sharp eye on philosophers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0089.mp3|and having read between their lines long enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0090.mp3|i now say to myself that the greater part of conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0091.mp3|and it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0092.mp3|one has here to learn anew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0093.mp3|as one learned anew about heredity and innateness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0095.mp3|just as little is being conscious opposed to the instinctive in any decisive sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0096.mp3|the greater part of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0097.mp3|and forced into definite channels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0098.mp3|and behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0099.mp3|there are valuations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0100.mp3|or to speak more plainly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0101.mp3|physiological demands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0102.mp3|for the maintenance of a definite mode of life for example|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0103.mp3|that the certain is worth more than the uncertain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0104.mp3|that illusion is less valuable than truth such valuations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0105.mp3|in spite of their regulative importance for us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0106.mp3|might notwithstanding be only superficial valuations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0108.mp3|such as may be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0109.mp3|supposing in effect that man is not just the measure of things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0110.mp3|the falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0111.mp3|it is here perhaps that our new language sounds most strangely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0112.mp3|the question is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0113.mp3|how far an opinion is life furthering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0114.mp3|life preserving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0115.mp3|species preserving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0116.mp3|perhaps species rearing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0118.mp3|are the most indispensable to us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0119.mp3|that without a recognition of logical fictions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0120.mp3|without a comparison of reality with the purely imagined world of the absolute and immutable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0121.mp3|without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0122.mp3|man could not live|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0124.mp3|a negation of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0126.mp3|and a philosophy which ventures to do so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0127.mp3|has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0128.mp3|that which causes philosophers to be regarded half distrustfully and half mockingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0129.mp3|is not the oft repeated discovery how innocent they are|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0130.mp3|how often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0133.mp3|but that there is not enough honest dealing with them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0134.mp3|whereas they all raise a loud and virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in the remotest manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0135.mp3|they all pose as though their real opinions had been discovered and attained through the self evolving of a cold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0137.mp3|divinely indifferent dialectic in contrast to all sorts of mystics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0139.mp3|fairer and foolisher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0140.mp3|talk of inspiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0142.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0143.mp3|a prejudiced proposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0145.mp3|or suggestion which is generally their heart's desire abstracted and refined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0146.mp3|is defended by them with arguments sought out after the event|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0147.mp3|they are all advocates who do not wish to be regarded as such|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0148.mp3|generally astute defenders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0150.mp3|of their prejudices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0152.mp3|and very far from having the conscience which bravely admits this to itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0153.mp3|very far from having the good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this be understood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0154.mp3|perhaps to warn friend or foe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0155.mp3|or in cheerful confidence and self ridicule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0157.mp3|equally stiff and decent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0159.mp3|makes us fastidious ones smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0160.mp3|we who find no small amusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical preachers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0162.mp3|still more so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0164.mp3|by means of which spinoza has|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0165.mp3|as it were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0166.mp3|clad his philosophy in mail and mask|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0169.mp3|in order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible maiden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0171.mp3|how much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0172.mp3|it has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up till now has consisted of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0174.mp3|the confession of its originator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0176.mp3|and moreover that the moral or immoral purpose in every philosophy has constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0178.mp3|to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have been arrived at|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0179.mp3|it is always well and wise to first ask oneself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0181.mp3|i do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0182.mp3|but that another impulse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0183.mp3|here as elsewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0184.mp3|has only made use of knowledge and mistaken knowledge as an instrument|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0186.mp3|will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0187.mp3|and that each one of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate lord over all the other impulses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0190.mp3|in the case of scholars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0191.mp3|in the case of really scientific men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0192.mp3|it may be otherwise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0193.mp3|better if you will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0197.mp3|when well wound up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0198.mp3|works away industriously to that end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0199.mp3|without the rest of the scholarly impulses taking any material part therein|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0202.mp3|are generally in quite another direction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0203.mp3|in the family perhaps or in money making or in politics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0206.mp3|almost indifferent at what point of research his little machine is placed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0207.mp3|and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a good philologist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0208.mp3|a mushroom specialist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0209.mp3|or a chemist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0211.mp3|in the philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0212.mp3|on the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0213.mp3|there is absolutely nothing impersonal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0215.mp3|his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to who he is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0216.mp3|that is to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0217.mp3|in what order the deepest impulses of his nature stand to each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0218.mp3|how malicious philosophers can be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0219.mp3|i know of nothing more stinging than the joke epicurus took the liberty of making on plato and the platonists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0221.mp3|in its original sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0222.mp3|and on the face of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0223.mp3|the word signifies flatterers of dionysius|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0226.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0230.mp3|and the latter is really the malignant reproach that epicurus cast upon plato|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0233.mp3|of which epicurus was not a master|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0235.mp3|the old school teacher of samos|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0236.mp3|who sat concealed in his little garden at athens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0237.mp3|and wrote three hundred books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0238.mp3|perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of plato|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0239.mp3|who knows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0240.mp3|greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden god epicurus really was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0241.mp3|did she ever find out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0242.mp3|there is a point in every philosophy at which the conviction of the philosopher appears on the scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0243.mp3|or to put it in the words of an ancient mystery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0245.mp3|you desire to live according to nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0247.mp3|imagine to yourselves a being like nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0248.mp3|boundlessly extravagant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0249.mp3|boundlessly indifferent|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0251.mp3|without pity or justice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0252.mp3|at once fruitful and barren and uncertain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0253.mp3|imagine to yourselves indifference as a power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0254.mp3|how could you live in accordance with such indifference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0256.mp3|is not that just endeavouring to be otherwise than this nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0257.mp3|is not living valuing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0259.mp3|being unjust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0260.mp3|being limited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0261.mp3|endeavouring to be different|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0264.mp3|how could you do differently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0266.mp3|and must be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0267.mp3|in reality however it is quite otherwise with you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0269.mp3|you want something quite the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0270.mp3|you extraordinary stage players and self deluders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0271.mp3|in your pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0272.mp3|to nature herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0273.mp3|and to incorporate them therein|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0277.mp3|with all your love for truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0278.mp3|you have forced yourselves so long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0279.mp3|so persistently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0280.mp3|and with such hypnotic rigidity to see nature falsely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0284.mp3|and to crown all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0286.mp3|stoicism is self tyranny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0288.mp3|is not the stoic a part of nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0289.mp3|but this is an old and everlasting story|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0291.mp3|as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0292.mp3|it always creates the world in its own image|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0293.mp3|it cannot do otherwise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0294.mp3|philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0295.mp3|the most spiritual will to power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0297.mp3|the eagerness and subtlety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0298.mp3|i should even say craftiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0299.mp3|with which the problem of the real and the apparent world is dealt with at present throughout europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0300.mp3|furnishes food for thought and attention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0301.mp3|and he who hears only a will to truth in the background|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0302.mp3|and nothing else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0303.mp3|cannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0304.mp3|in rare and isolated cases|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0305.mp3|it may really have happened that such a will to truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0306.mp3|a certain extravagant and adventurous pluck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0307.mp3|a metaphysician's ambition of the forlorn hope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0308.mp3|has participated therein|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0309.mp3|that which in the end always prefers a handful of certainty to a whole cartload of beautiful possibilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0310.mp3|there may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0312.mp3|rather than in an uncertain something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0313.mp3|but that is nihilism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0314.mp3|and the sign of a despairing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0315.mp3|mortally wearied soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0317.mp3|it seems|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0323.mp3|allowing with complacency their securest possession to escape for what does one at present believe in more firmly than in one's body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0324.mp3|who knows if they are not really trying to win back something which was formerly an even securer possession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0325.mp3|something of the old domain of the faith of former times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0326.mp3|perhaps the immortal soul perhaps the old god in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0327.mp3|ideas by which they could live better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0329.mp3|more vigorously and more joyously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0330.mp3|than by modern ideas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0331.mp3|there is distrust of these modern ideas in this mode of looking at things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0337.mp3|in whom there is nothing either new or true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0338.mp3|except this motleyness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0340.mp3|their instinct which repels them from modern reality is unrefuted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0341.mp3|what do their retrograde by paths concern us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0343.mp3|a little more strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0346.mp3|and artistic power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0347.mp3|and they would be off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0348.mp3|and not back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0350.mp3|and especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0351.mp3|kant was first and foremost proud of his table of categories|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0352.mp3|with it in his hand he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0353.mp3|this is the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0354.mp3|let us only understand this could be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0355.mp3|he was proud of having discovered a new faculty in man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0357.mp3|granting that he deceived himself in this matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0358.mp3|the development and rapid flourishing of german philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0359.mp3|and on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0360.mp3|at all events new faculties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0361.mp3|of which to be still prouder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0362.mp3|but let us reflect for a moment it is high time to do so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0364.mp3|and what is really his answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0365.mp3|by means of a means faculty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0366.mp3|but unfortunately not in five words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0367.mp3|but so circumstantially|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0368.mp3|imposingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0369.mp3|and with such display of german profundity and verbal flourishes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0371.mp3|people were beside themselves with delight over this new faculty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0372.mp3|and the jubilation reached its climax when kant further discovered a moral faculty in man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0373.mp3|for at that time germans were still moral|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0374.mp3|not yet dabbling in the politics of hard fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0375.mp3|then came the honeymoon of german philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0377.mp3|all seeking for faculties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0378.mp3|and what did they not find|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0379.mp3|in that innocent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0381.mp3|and still youthful period of the german spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0382.mp3|to which romanticism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0383.mp3|the malicious fairy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0384.mp3|piped and sang|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0385.mp3|when one could not yet distinguish between finding and inventing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0386.mp3|above all a faculty for the transcendental|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0388.mp3|intellectual intuition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0389.mp3|and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally pious inclined germans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0390.mp3|one can do no greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement which was really youthfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0391.mp3|notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0392.mp3|in hoary and senile conceptions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0393.mp3|than to take it seriously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0399.mp3|by means of a means faculty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0400.mp3|he had said or at least meant to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0401.mp3|but is that an answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0402.mp3|an explanation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0403.mp3|or is it not rather merely a repetition of the question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0404.mp3|how does opium induce sleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0411.mp3|how are synthetic judgments a priori possible by another question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0412.mp3|why is belief in such judgments necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0413.mp3|in effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0414.mp3|it is high time that we should understand that such judgments must be believed to be true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0415.mp3|for the sake of the preservation of creatures like ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0417.mp3|or more plainly spoken and roughly and readily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0418.mp3|synthetic judgments a priori should not be possible at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0419.mp3|we have no right to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0420.mp3|in our mouths they are nothing but false judgments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0423.mp3|the belief in their truth is necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0425.mp3|and finally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0426.mp3|to call to mind the enormous influence which german philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0428.mp3|has exercised throughout the whole of europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0430.mp3|thanks to german philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0431.mp3|it was a delight to the noble idlers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0432.mp3|the virtuous|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0438.mp3|in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0440.mp3|as regards materialistic atomism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0441.mp3|it is one of the best refuted theories that have been advanced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0442.mp3|and in europe there is now perhaps no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0443.mp3|except for convenient everyday use as an abbreviation of the means of expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0447.mp3|contrary to all the senses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0448.mp3|that the earth does not stand fast|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0456.mp3|and also declare war|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0458.mp3|against the atomistic requirements which still lead a dangerous after life in places where no one suspects them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0459.mp3|like the more celebrated metaphysical requirements|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0466.mp3|this belief ought to be expelled from science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0467.mp3|between ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0468.mp3|it is not at all necessary to get rid of the soul thereby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0469.mp3|and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypotheses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0470.mp3|as happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0473.mp3|and such conceptions as mortal soul and soul of subjective multiplicity and soul as social structure of the instincts and passions want henceforth to have legitimate rights in science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0474.mp3|in that the new psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of the soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0475.mp3|he is really|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0477.mp3|thrusting himself into a new desert and a new distrust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0478.mp3|it is possible that the older psychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0479.mp3|eventually|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0481.mp3|he finds that precisely thereby he is also condemned to invent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0483.mp3|perhaps to discover the new|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0484.mp3|psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the instinct of self preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0485.mp3|a living thing seeks above all to discharge its strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0486.mp3|life itself is will to power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0487.mp3|self preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent results thereof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0488.mp3|in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0490.mp3|as everywhere else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0491.mp3|let us beware of superfluous teleological principles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0494.mp3|in effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0495.mp3|that method ordains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0496.mp3|which must be essentially economy of principles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0497.mp3|it is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural philosophy is only a world exposition and world arrangement according to us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0498.mp3|if i may say so and not a world explanation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0499.mp3|but in so far as it is based on belief in the senses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0500.mp3|it is regarded as more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0501.mp3|and for a long time to come must be regarded as more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0502.mp3|namely as an explanation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0503.mp3|it has eyes and fingers of its own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0504.mp3|it has ocular evidence and palpableness of its own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0505.mp3|this operates fascinatingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0506.mp3|persuasively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0507.mp3|and convincingly upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0509.mp3|it follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0510.mp3|what is clear what is explained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0511.mp3|only that which can be seen and felt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0512.mp3|one must pursue every problem thus far|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0515.mp3|the charm of the platonic mode of thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0516.mp3|which was an aristocratic mode|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0517.mp3|consisted precisely in resistance to obvious sense evidence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0518.mp3|perhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our contemporaries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0519.mp3|but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0520.mp3|and this by means of pale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0523.mp3|the mob of the senses as plato said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0524.mp3|in this overcoming of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0525.mp3|and interpreting of the world in the manner of plato|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0528.mp3|with their principle of the smallest possible effort and the greatest possible blunder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0529.mp3|where there is nothing more to see or to grasp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0530.mp3|there is also nothing more for men to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0531.mp3|that is certainly an imperative different from the platonic one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0533.mp3|laborious race of machinists and bridge builders of the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0534.mp3|who have nothing but rough work to perform|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0535.mp3|to study physiology with a clear conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0536.mp3|one must insist on the fact that the sense organs are not phenomena in the sense of the idealistic philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0537.mp3|as such they certainly could not be causes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0539.mp3|therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0540.mp3|at least as regulative hypothesis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0541.mp3|if not as heuristic principle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0543.mp3|and others say even that the external world is the work of our organs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0544.mp3|but then our body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0545.mp3|as a part of this external world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0546.mp3|would be the work of our organs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0547.mp3|but then our organs themselves would be the work of our organs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0548.mp3|it seems to me that this is a complete reductio ad absurdum|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0550.mp3|consequently the external world is not the work of our organs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0551.mp3|there are still harmless self observers who believe that there are immediate certainties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0552.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0553.mp3|i think or as the superstition of schopenhauer puts it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0555.mp3|as though cognition here got hold of its object purely and simply as the thing in itself without any falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the object|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0560.mp3|we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0561.mp3|the people on their part may think that cognition is knowing all about things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0562.mp3|but the philosopher must say to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0565.mp3|the argumentative proof of which would be difficult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0566.mp3|perhaps impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0568.mp3|that it is i who think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0569.mp3|that there must necessarily be something that thinks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0570.mp3|that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0572.mp3|that it is already determined what is to be designated by thinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0573.mp3|that i know what thinking is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0574.mp3|for if i had not already decided within myself what it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0576.mp3|in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0578.mp3|in order to determine what it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0580.mp3|at any rate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0581.mp3|no immediate certainty for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0582.mp3|in place of the immediate certainty in which the people may believe in the special case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0583.mp3|the philosopher thus finds a series of metaphysical questions presented to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0584.mp3|veritable conscience questions of the intellect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0587.mp3|why do i believe in cause and effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0590.mp3|like the person who says|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0591.mp3|i think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0597.mp3|will encounter a smile and two notes of interrogation in a philosopher nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0598.mp3|sir the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0599.mp3|it is improbable that you are not mistaken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0600.mp3|but why should it be the truth seventeen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0601.mp3|with regard to the superstitions of logicians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0604.mp3|which is unwillingly recognized by these credulous minds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0605.mp3|namely that a thought comes when it wishes and not when i wish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0606.mp3|so that it is a perversion of the facts of the case to say that the subject i is the condition of the predicate think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0607.mp3|one thinks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0609.mp3|to put it mildly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0610.mp3|only a supposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0611.mp3|an assertion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0612.mp3|and assuredly not an immediate certainty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0613.mp3|after all one has even gone too far with this one thinks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0614.mp3|even the one contains an interpretation of the process|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0615.mp3|and does not belong to the process itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0616.mp3|one infers here according to the usual grammatical formula|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0617.mp3|to think is an activity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0618.mp3|every activity requires an agency that is active|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0619.mp3|consequently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0620.mp3|it was pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0621.mp3|besides the operating power the material particle wherein it resides and out of which it operates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0622.mp3|the atom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0623.mp3|more rigorous minds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0624.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0625.mp3|learnt at last to get along without this earth residuum and perhaps some day we shall accustom ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0626.mp3|even from the logician's point of view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0627.mp3|to get along without the little one to which the worthy old ego has refined itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0629.mp3|it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle minds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0630.mp3|it seems that the hundred times refuted theory of the free will owes its persistence to this charm alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0632.mp3|philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were the best known thing in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0634.mp3|schopenhauer has given us to understand that the will alone is really known to us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0635.mp3|absolutely and completely known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0636.mp3|without deduction or addition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0637.mp3|but it again and again seems to me that in this case schopenhauer also only did what philosophers are in the habit of doing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0638.mp3|he seems to have adopted a popular prejudice and exaggerated it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0639.mp3|willing seems to me to be above all something complicated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0640.mp3|something that is a unity only in name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0641.mp3|and it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0642.mp3|which has got the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0643.mp3|so let us for once be more cautious let us be unphilosophical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0644.mp3|let us say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0646.mp3|the sensation of the condition away from which we go the sensation of the condition towards which we go the sensation of this from and towards itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0647.mp3|and then besides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0648.mp3|an accompanying muscular sensation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0650.mp3|even without our putting in motion arms and legs commences its action by force of habit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0651.mp3|directly we will anything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0652.mp3|therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0655.mp3|in the second place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0656.mp3|thinking is also to be recognized|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0657.mp3|in every act of the will there is a ruling thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0658.mp3|and let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from the willing as if the will would then remain over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0659.mp3|in the third place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0660.mp3|the will is not only a complex of sensation and thinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0661.mp3|but it is above all an emotion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0662.mp3|and in fact the emotion of the command|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0663.mp3|that which is termed freedom of the will is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0665.mp3|this consciousness is inherent in every will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0666.mp3|and equally so the straining of the attention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0667.mp3|the straight look which fixes itself exclusively on one thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0668.mp3|the unconditional judgment that this and nothing else is necessary now the inward certainty that obedience will be rendered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0669.mp3|and whatever else pertains to the position of the commander|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0670.mp3|a man who wills commands something within himself which renders obedience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0671.mp3|or which he believes renders obedience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0672.mp3|but now let us notice what is the strangest thing about the will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0673.mp3|this affair so extremely complex|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0674.mp3|for which the people have only one name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0675.mp3|inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding and the obeying parties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0676.mp3|and as the obeying party we know the sensations of constraint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0677.mp3|impulsion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0678.mp3|pressure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0680.mp3|and motion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0681.mp3|which usually commence immediately after the act of will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0683.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0684.mp3|we are accustomed to disregard this duality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0685.mp3|and to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term i|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0686.mp3|a whole series of erroneous conclusions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0687.mp3|and consequently of false judgments about the will itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0688.mp3|has become attached to the act of willing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0689.mp3|to such a degree that he who wills believes firmly that willing suffices for action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0690.mp3|since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will when the effect of the command|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0691.mp3|consequently obedience and therefore action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0692.mp3|was to be expected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0693.mp3|the appearance has translated itself into the sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0694.mp3|as if there were a necessity of effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0695.mp3|in a word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0696.mp3|he who wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0697.mp3|he ascribes the success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0698.mp3|the carrying out of the willing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0699.mp3|to the will itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0700.mp3|and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0701.mp3|freedom of will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0702.mp3|that is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0703.mp3|who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0705.mp3|as such|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0706.mp3|enjoys also the triumph over obstacles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0707.mp3|but thinks within himself that it was really his own will that overcame them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0708.mp3|in this way the person exercising volition adds the feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0710.mp3|indeed our body is but a social structure composed of many souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0711.mp3|to his feelings of delight as commander|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0713.mp3|namely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0714.mp3|that the governing class identifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0715.mp3|in all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0716.mp3|on the basis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0717.mp3|as already said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0718.mp3|of a social structure composed of many souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0719.mp3|on which account a philosopher should claim the right to include willing as such within the sphere of morals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0720.mp3|regarded as the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of life manifests itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0722.mp3|but grow up in connection and relationship with each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0726.mp3|is betrayed in the end by the circumstance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0727.mp3|how unfailingly the most diverse philosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme of possible philosophies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0728.mp3|under an invisible spell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0729.mp3|they always revolve once more in the same orbit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0730.mp3|however independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0731.mp3|something within them leads them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0732.mp3|something impels them in definite order the one after the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0733.mp3|to wit the innate methodology and relationship of their ideas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0735.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0737.mp3|a remembering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0738.mp3|a return and a home coming to a far off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0739.mp3|ancient common household of the soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0740.mp3|out of which those ideas formerly grew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0742.mp3|the wonderful family resemblance of all indian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0745.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0746.mp3|where there is affinity of language|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0747.mp3|owing to the common philosophy of grammar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0748.mp3|i mean owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical functions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0749.mp3|it cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outset for a similar development and succession of philosophical systems|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0750.mp3|just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of world interpretation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0752.mp3|the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately also the spell of physiological valuations and racial conditions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0755.mp3|it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0756.mp3|but the extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with this very folly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0757.mp3|the desire for freedom of will in the superlative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0758.mp3|metaphysical sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0759.mp3|such as still holds sway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0760.mp3|unfortunately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0761.mp3|in the minds of the half educated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0762.mp3|the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0763.mp3|and to absolve god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0764.mp3|the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0767.mp3|and society therefrom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0769.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0772.mp3|out of the slough of nothingness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0773.mp3|if any one should find out in this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of free will and put it out of his head altogether|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0774.mp3|i beg of him to carry his enlightenment a step further|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0775.mp3|and also put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception of free will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0776.mp3|i mean non free will which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0779.mp3|one should use cause and effect only as pure conceptions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0780.mp3|that is to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0781.mp3|as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutual understanding|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0782.mp3|not for explanation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0783.mp3|in being in itself there is nothing of casual connection of necessity or of psychological non freedom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0784.mp3|there the effect does not follow the cause|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0797.mp3|as being in itself with things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0798.mp3|we act once more as we have always acted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0799.mp3|mythologically the non free will is mythology|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0800.mp3|in real life it is only a question of strong and weak wills|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0801.mp3|it is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0802.mp3|when a thinker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0803.mp3|in every causal connection and psychological necessity manifests something of compulsion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0805.mp3|obsequiousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0807.mp3|and non freedom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0808.mp3|it is suspicious to have such feelings the person betrays himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0809.mp3|and in general|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0810.mp3|if i have observed correctly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0811.mp3|the non freedom of the will is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0812.mp3|but always in a profoundly personal manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0813.mp3|some will not give up their responsibility their belief in themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0815.mp3|at any price the vain races belong to this class|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0819.mp3|and owing to an inward self contempt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0820.mp3|seek to get out of the business|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0824.mp3|are in the habit at present of taking the side of criminals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0826.mp3|and as a matter of fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0828.mp3|that is its good taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0829.mp3|let me be pardoned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0830.mp3|as an old philologist who cannot desist from the mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0831.mp3|but nature's conformity to law of which you physicists talk so proudly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0833.mp3|why it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad philology|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0834.mp3|it is no matter of fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0835.mp3|no text but rather just a naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0836.mp3|with which you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0838.mp3|nature is not different in that respect nor better than we|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0839.mp3|a fine instance of secret motive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0840.mp3|in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and autocratic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0841.mp3|likewise a second and more refined atheism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0842.mp3|is once more disguised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0844.mp3|and therefore cheers for natural law is it not so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0845.mp3|but as has been said that is interpretation not text|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0848.mp3|with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0849.mp3|could read out of the same nature and with regard to the same phenomena|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0850.mp3|just the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claims of power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0851.mp3|an interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and unconditionalness of all will to power before your eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0852.mp3|that almost every word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0853.mp3|and the word tyranny itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0854.mp3|would eventually seem unsuitable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0855.mp3|or like a weakening and softening metaphor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0856.mp3|as being too human|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0857.mp3|and who should|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0858.mp3|nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0859.mp3|end by asserting the same about this world as you do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0864.mp3|but because they are absolutely lacking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0865.mp3|and every power effects its ultimate consequences every moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0867.mp3|and you will be eager enough to make this objection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0868.mp3|well so much the better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0869.mp3|all psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and timidities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0870.mp3|it has not dared to launch out into the depths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0871.mp3|in so far as it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0872.mp3|evidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0874.mp3|as i conceive of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0875.mp3|the power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most intellectual world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0876.mp3|the world apparently most indifferent and unprejudiced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0877.mp3|and has obviously operated in an injurious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0880.mp3|and distorting manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0881.mp3|a proper physio psychology has to contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0882.mp3|it has the heart against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal conditionalness of the good and the bad impulses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0884.mp3|still more so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0885.mp3|a doctrine of the derivation of all good impulses from bad ones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0887.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0888.mp3|a person should regard even the emotions of hatred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0890.mp3|covetousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0891.mp3|and imperiousness as life conditioning emotions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0892.mp3|as factors which must be present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0893.mp3|fundamentally and essentially|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0894.mp3|in the general economy of life which must|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0896.mp3|be further developed if life is to be further developed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0897.mp3|he will suffer from such a view of things as from sea sickness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0898.mp3|and yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0899.mp3|and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one should keep away from it who can do so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0900.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0901.mp3|if one has once drifted hither with one's bark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0902.mp3|well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0905.mp3|let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0906.mp3|we sail away right over morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0907.mp3|we crush out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0908.mp3|we destroy perhaps the remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0909.mp3|but what do we matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0911.mp3|and the psychologist who thus makes a sacrifice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0913.mp3|will at least be entitled to demand in return that psychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0914.mp3|for whose service and equipment the other sciences exist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_01_nietzsche_0915.mp3|for psychology is once more the path to the fundamental problems|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0001.mp3|in what strange simplification and falsification man lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0002.mp3|one can never cease wondering when once one has got eyes for beholding this marvel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0003.mp3|how we have made everything around us clear and free and easy and simple|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0004.mp3|how we have been able to give our senses a passport to everything superficial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0005.mp3|our thoughts a godlike desire for wanton pranks and wrong inferences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0006.mp3|how from the beginning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0007.mp3|we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost inconceivable freedom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0008.mp3|thoughtlessness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0012.mp3|in order to enjoy life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0013.mp3|and only on this solidified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0015.mp3|the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0016.mp3|the will to ignorance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0017.mp3|to the uncertain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0018.mp3|to the untrue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0019.mp3|not as its opposite but as its refinement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0020.mp3|it is to be hoped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0022.mp3|that language|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0023.mp3|here as elsewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0024.mp3|will not get over its awkwardness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0027.mp3|which now belongs to our unconquerable flesh and blood will turn the words round in the mouths of us discerning ones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0028.mp3|here and there we understand it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0029.mp3|and laugh at the way in which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in this simplified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0030.mp3|thoroughly artificial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0031.mp3|suitably imagined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0032.mp3|and suitably falsified world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0034.mp3|whether it will or not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0035.mp3|it loves error|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0036.mp3|because|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0037.mp3|as living itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0038.mp3|it loves life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0039.mp3|after such a cheerful commencement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0040.mp3|a serious word would fain be heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0041.mp3|it appeals to the most serious minds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0043.mp3|ye philosophers and friends of knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0044.mp3|and beware of martyrdom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0045.mp3|of suffering for the truth's sake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0047.mp3|it spoils all the innocence and fine neutrality of your conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0048.mp3|it makes you headstrong against objections and red rags|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0049.mp3|it stupefies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0051.mp3|and brutalizes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0052.mp3|when in the struggle with danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0055.mp3|expulsion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0056.mp3|and even worse consequences of enmity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0058.mp3|as though the truth were such an innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0059.mp3|and you of all people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0060.mp3|ye knights of the sorrowful countenance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0061.mp3|messrs loafers and cobweb spinners of the spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0062.mp3|finally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0063.mp3|ye know sufficiently well that it cannot be of any consequence if ye just carry your point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0064.mp3|ye know that hitherto no philosopher has carried his point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0065.mp3|and that there might be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark which you place after your special words and favourite doctrines and occasionally after yourselves than in all the solemn pantomime and trumping games before accusers and law courts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0066.mp3|rather go out of the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0067.mp3|flee into concealment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0070.mp3|or somewhat feared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0071.mp3|and pray don't forget the garden the garden with golden trellis work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0072.mp3|and have people around you who are as a garden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0073.mp3|or as music on the waters at eventide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0074.mp3|when already the day becomes a memory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0075.mp3|choose the good solitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0079.mp3|which also gives you the right still to remain good in any sense whatsoever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0080.mp3|how poisonous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0081.mp3|how crafty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0083.mp3|does every long war make one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0084.mp3|which cannot be waged openly by means of force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0085.mp3|how personal does a long fear make one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0086.mp3|a long watching of enemies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0087.mp3|of possible enemies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0090.mp3|always become in the end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0091.mp3|even under the most intellectual masquerade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0092.mp3|and perhaps without being themselves aware of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0094.mp3|not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0095.mp3|which is the unfailing sign in a philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0096.mp3|the martyrdom of the philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0097.mp3|his sacrifice for the sake of truth forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0098.mp3|and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0101.mp3|that it is necessary with such a desire to be clear what spectacle one will see in any case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0104.mp3|merely the continued proof that the long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0105.mp3|real tragedy is at an end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0106.mp3|supposing that every philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0107.mp3|every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0108.mp3|where he is free from the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0110.mp3|the majority|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0111.mp3|where he may forget men who are the rule as their exception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0112.mp3|exclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0113.mp3|as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0115.mp3|in intercourse with men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0116.mp3|does not occasionally glisten in all the green and grey colours of distress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0117.mp3|owing to disgust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0122.mp3|is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0125.mp3|that he does not voluntarily take all this burden and disgust upon himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0126.mp3|that he persistently avoids it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0128.mp3|as i said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0130.mp3|one thing is then certain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0131.mp3|he was not made he was not predestined for knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0132.mp3|for as such he would one day have to say to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0133.mp3|the devil take my good taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0136.mp3|the exception and he would go down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0139.mp3|the long and serious study of the average man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0140.mp3|and consequently much disguise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0141.mp3|self overcoming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0142.mp3|familiarity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0143.mp3|and bad intercourse all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one's equals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0144.mp3|that constitutes a necessary part of the life history of every philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0145.mp3|perhaps the most disagreeable odious and disappointing part|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0146.mp3|if he is fortunate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0147.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0148.mp3|as a favourite child of knowledge should be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0149.mp3|he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and lighten his task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0150.mp3|i mean so called cynics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0151.mp3|those who simply recognize the animal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0152.mp3|the commonplace and the rule in themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0153.mp3|and at the same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them talk of themselves and their like before witnesses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0155.mp3|cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach what is called honesty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0156.mp3|and the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0157.mp3|and congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0163.mp3|as in the case of the abbe galiani|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0164.mp3|the profoundest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0166.mp3|and perhaps also filthiest man of his century|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0167.mp3|he was far profounder than voltaire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0168.mp3|and consequently also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0169.mp3|a good deal more silent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0170.mp3|it happens more frequently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0171.mp3|as has been hinted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0172.mp3|that a scientific head is placed on an ape's body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0173.mp3|a fine exceptional understanding in a base soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0174.mp3|an occurrence by no means rare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0175.mp3|especially among doctors and moral physiologists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0176.mp3|and whenever anyone speaks without bitterness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0177.mp3|or rather quite innocently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0178.mp3|of man as a belly with two requirements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0179.mp3|and a head with one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0180.mp3|whenever any one sees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0182.mp3|and wants to see only hunger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0183.mp3|sexual instinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0184.mp3|and vanity as the real and only motives of human actions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0185.mp3|in short when any one speaks badly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0186.mp3|and not even ill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0188.mp3|then ought the lover of knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0189.mp3|he ought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0191.mp3|to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0192.mp3|for the indignant man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0193.mp3|and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself with his own teeth or|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0194.mp3|in place of himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0197.mp3|or society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0199.mp3|morally speaking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0201.mp3|but in every other sense he is the more ordinary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0202.mp3|more indifferent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0203.mp3|and less instructive case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0204.mp3|and no one is such a liar as the indignant man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0205.mp3|it is difficult to be understood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0210.mp3|and one should be heartily grateful for the good will to some refinement of interpretation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0211.mp3|as regards the good friends however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0213.mp3|and think that as friends they have a right to ease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0215.mp3|one can thus laugh still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0216.mp3|or get rid of them altogether these good friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0217.mp3|and laugh then also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0218.mp3|what is most difficult to render from one language into another is the tempo of its style|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0219.mp3|which has its basis in the character of the race|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0220.mp3|or to speak more physiologically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0221.mp3|in the average tempo of the assimilation of its nutriment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0222.mp3|there are honestly meant translations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0226.mp3|merely because its lively and merry tempo which overleaps and obviates all dangers in word and expression could not also be rendered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0227.mp3|a german is almost incapacitated for presto in his language|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0228.mp3|consequently also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0229.mp3|as may be reasonably inferred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0231.mp3|free spirited thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0233.mp3|so aristophanes and petronius are untranslatable for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0234.mp3|everything ponderous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0236.mp3|and pompously clumsy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0237.mp3|all long winded and wearying species of style|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0238.mp3|are developed in profuse variety among germans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0240.mp3|in its mixture of stiffness and elegance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0241.mp3|is no exception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0242.mp3|as a reflection of the good old time to which it belongs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0244.mp3|lessing is an exception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0245.mp3|owing to his histrionic nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0250.mp3|and still more willingly among the roman comedy writers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0251.mp3|lessing loved also free spiritism in the tempo|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0252.mp3|and flight out of germany|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0253.mp3|but how could the german language|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0254.mp3|even in the prose of lessing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0257.mp3|fine air of florence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0259.mp3|perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he ventures to present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0263.mp3|dangerous thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0264.mp3|and a tempo of the gallop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0265.mp3|and of the best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0266.mp3|wantonest humour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0267.mp3|finally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0268.mp3|who would venture on a german translation of petronius|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0269.mp3|who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0270.mp3|more than any great musician hitherto|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0271.mp3|was a master of presto in invention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0274.mp3|what matter in the end about the swamps of the sick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0276.mp3|or of the ancient world when like him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0277.mp3|one has the feet of a wind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0279.mp3|the breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0280.mp3|the emancipating scorn of a wind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0281.mp3|which makes everything healthy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0282.mp3|by making everything run|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0283.mp3|and with regard to aristophanes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0284.mp3|that transfiguring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0286.mp3|for whose sake one pardons all hellenism for having existed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0287.mp3|provided one has understood in its full profundity all that there requires pardon and transfiguration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0288.mp3|there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on plato's secrecy and sphinx like nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0292.mp3|but a book of aristophanes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0293.mp3|how could even plato have endured life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0294.mp3|a greek life which he repudiated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0295.mp3|without an aristophanes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0297.mp3|it is a privilege of the strong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0298.mp3|and whoever attempts it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0299.mp3|even with the best right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0300.mp3|but without being obliged to do so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0301.mp3|proves that he is probably not only strong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0302.mp3|but also daring beyond measure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0303.mp3|he enters into a labyrinth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0304.mp3|he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already brings with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0305.mp3|not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0306.mp3|becomes isolated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0308.mp3|supposing such a one comes to grief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0309.mp3|it is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0310.mp3|nor sympathize with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0311.mp3|and he cannot any longer go back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0312.mp3|he cannot even go back again to the sympathy of men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0313.mp3|our deepest insights must|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0314.mp3|and should|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0315.mp3|appear as follies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0316.mp3|and under certain circumstances as crimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0318.mp3|the exoteric and the esoteric|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0319.mp3|as they were formerly distinguished by philosophers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0320.mp3|among the indians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0323.mp3|and mussulmans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0324.mp3|in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0325.mp3|wherever people believed in gradations of rank and not in equality and equal rights|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0326.mp3|are not so much in contradistinction to one another in respect to the exoteric class|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0329.mp3|estimating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0331.mp3|and judging from the outside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0332.mp3|and not from the inside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0333.mp3|the more essential distinction is that the class in question views things from below upwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0334.mp3|while the esoteric class views things from above downwards there are heights of the soul from which tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0335.mp3|and if all the woe in the world were taken together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0336.mp3|who would dare to decide whether the sight of it would necessarily seduce and constrain to sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0337.mp3|and thus to a doubling of the woe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0338.mp3|that which serves the higher class of men for nourishment or refreshment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0339.mp3|must be almost poison to an entirely different and lower order of human beings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0340.mp3|the virtues of the common man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0341.mp3|it might be possible for a highly developed man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0342.mp3|supposing him to degenerate and go to ruin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0343.mp3|to acquire qualities thereby alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0345.mp3|there are books which have an inverse value for the soul and the health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0346.mp3|or the higher and more powerful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0347.mp3|make use of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0348.mp3|in the former case they are dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0350.mp3|unsettling books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0351.mp3|in the latter case they are herald calls which summon the bravest to their bravery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0352.mp3|books for the general reader are always ill smelling books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0353.mp3|the odour of paltry people clings to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0354.mp3|where the populace eat and drink|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0356.mp3|it is accustomed to stink|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0357.mp3|one should not go into churches if one wishes to breathe pure air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0358.mp3|in our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the art of nuance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0359.mp3|which is the best gain of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0360.mp3|and we have rightly to do hard penance for having fallen upon men and things with yea and nay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0361.mp3|everything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0363.mp3|until a man learns to introduce a little art into his sentiments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0364.mp3|and prefers to try conclusions with the artificial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0365.mp3|as do the real artists of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0366.mp3|the angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no peace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0367.mp3|until it has suitably falsified men and things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0368.mp3|to be able to vent its passion upon them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0369.mp3|youth in itself even is something falsifying and deceptive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0371.mp3|when the young soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0372.mp3|tortured by continual disillusions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0373.mp3|finally turns suspiciously against itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0374.mp3|still ardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0376.mp3|how impatiently it tears itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0377.mp3|how it revenges itself for its long self blinding|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0378.mp3|as though it had been a voluntary blindness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0379.mp3|in this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one's sentiments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0380.mp3|one tortures one's enthusiasm with doubt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0381.mp3|one feels even the good conscience to be a danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0382.mp3|as if it were the self concealment and lassitude of a more refined uprightness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0383.mp3|and above all one espouses upon principle the cause against youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0384.mp3|a decade later and one comprehends that all this was also still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0386.mp3|throughout the longest period of human history|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0387.mp3|one calls it the prehistoric period|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0388.mp3|the value or non value of an action was inferred from its consequences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0389.mp3|the action in itself was not taken into consideration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0390.mp3|any more than its origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0391.mp3|but pretty much as in china at present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0393.mp3|the retro operating power of success or failure was what induced men to think well or ill of an action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0394.mp3|let us call this period the pre moral period of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0395.mp3|the imperative know thyself was then still unknown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0396.mp3|in the last ten thousand years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0397.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0398.mp3|on certain large portions of the earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0399.mp3|one has gradually got so far|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0400.mp3|that one no longer lets the consequences of an action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0401.mp3|but its origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0402.mp3|decide with regard to its worth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0403.mp3|a great achievement as a whole|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0404.mp3|an important refinement of vision and of criterion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0405.mp3|the unconscious effect of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in origin the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense as the moral one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0406.mp3|the first attempt at self knowledge is thereby made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0407.mp3|instead of the consequences the origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0408.mp3|what an inversion of perspective|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0409.mp3|and assuredly an inversion effected only after long struggle and wavering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0411.mp3|an ominous new superstition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0412.mp3|a peculiar narrowness of interpretation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0413.mp3|attained supremacy precisely thereby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0414.mp3|the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definite sense possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0415.mp3|as origin out of an intention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0416.mp3|people were agreed in the belief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0417.mp3|the intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0418.mp3|under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been bestowed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0419.mp3|and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the present day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0423.mp3|owing to a new self consciousness and acuteness in man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0424.mp3|is it not possible that we may be standing on the threshold of a period which to begin with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0428.mp3|the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies precisely in that which is not intentional|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0429.mp3|and that all its intentionalness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0430.mp3|all that is seen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0432.mp3|or sensed in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0433.mp3|belongs to its surface or skin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0434.mp3|which like every skin betrays something but conceals still more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0435.mp3|in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0436.mp3|we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0437.mp3|which first requires an explanation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0439.mp3|moreover|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0440.mp3|which has too many interpretations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0441.mp3|and consequently hardly any meaning in itself alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0442.mp3|that morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0443.mp3|in the sense in which it has been understood hitherto|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0444.mp3|as intention morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0445.mp3|has been a prejudice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0446.mp3|perhaps a prematureness or preliminariness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0447.mp3|probably something of the same rank as astrology and alchemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0448.mp3|but in any case something which must be surmounted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0449.mp3|the surmounting of morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0451.mp3|let that be the name for the long secret labour which has been reserved for the most refined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0452.mp3|the most upright|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0454.mp3|as the living touchstones of the soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0455.mp3|it cannot be helped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0456.mp3|the sentiment of surrender|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0457.mp3|of sacrifice for one's neighbour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0458.mp3|and all self renunciation morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0459.mp3|must be mercilessly called to account|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0460.mp3|and brought to judgment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0461.mp3|just as the aesthetics of disinterested contemplation under which the emasculation of art nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0462.mp3|there is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments for others and not for myself for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0463.mp3|and for one asking promptly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0464.mp3|are they not perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0467.mp3|and him who enjoys their fruit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0468.mp3|and also the mere spectator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0469.mp3|that is still no argument in their favour but just calls for caution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0470.mp3|let us therefore be cautious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0472.mp3|seen from every position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0473.mp3|the erroneousness of the world in which we think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light upon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0475.mp3|which would fain allure us into surmises concerning a deceptive principle in the nature of things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0478.mp3|who makes thinking itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0479.mp3|and consequently the spirit responsible for the falseness of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0480.mp3|an honourable exit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0482.mp3|he who regards this world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0483.mp3|including space|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0486.mp3|and movement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0487.mp3|as falsely deduced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0488.mp3|would have at least good reason in the end to become distrustful also of all thinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0489.mp3|has it not hitherto been playing upon us the worst of scurvy tricks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0490.mp3|and what guarantee would it give that it would not continue to do what it has always been doing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0491.mp3|in all seriousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0492.mp3|the innocence of thinkers has something touching and respect inspiring in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0493.mp3|which even nowadays permits them to wait upon consciousness with the request that it will give them honest answers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0495.mp3|whether it be real or not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0496.mp3|and why it keeps the outer world so resolutely at a distance|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0499.mp3|but we have now to cease being merely moral men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0500.mp3|apart from morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0501.mp3|such belief is a folly which does little honour to us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0502.mp3|if in middle class life an ever ready distrust is regarded as the sign of a bad character and consequently as an imprudence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0503.mp3|here among us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0505.mp3|what should prevent our being imprudent and saying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0506.mp3|the philosopher has at length a right to bad character as the being who has hitherto been most befooled on earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0507.mp3|he is now under obligation to distrustfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0508.mp3|to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of suspicion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0509.mp3|forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0510.mp3|for i myself have long ago learned to think and estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0511.mp3|and i keep at least a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with which philosophers struggle against being deceived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0514.mp3|it is in fact the worst proved supposition in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0515.mp3|so much must be conceded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0516.mp3|there could have been no life at all except upon the basis of perspective estimates and semblances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0517.mp3|and if|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0518.mp3|with the virtuous enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0519.mp3|one wished to do away altogether with the seeming world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0520.mp3|well granted that you could do that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0521.mp3|at least nothing of your truth would thereby remain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0522.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0523.mp3|what is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an essential opposition of true and false|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0524.mp3|is it not enough to suppose degrees of seemingness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0525.mp3|and as it were lighter and darker shades and tones of semblance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0527.mp3|why might not the world which concerns us be a fiction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0528.mp3|and to any one who suggested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0529.mp3|but to a fiction belongs an originator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0530.mp3|might it not be bluntly replied why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0531.mp3|may not this belong also belong to the fiction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0532.mp3|is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the subject|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0534.mp3|might not the philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0535.mp3|all respect to governesses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0538.mp3|o humanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0540.mp3|there is something ticklish in the truth and in the search for the truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0541.mp3|and if man goes about it too humanely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0543.mp3|i wager he finds nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0544.mp3|supposing that nothing else is given as real but our world of desires and passions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0545.mp3|that we cannot sink or rise to any other reality but just that of our impulses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0546.mp3|for thinking is only a relation of these impulses to one another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0547.mp3|are we not permitted to make the attempt and to ask the question whether this which is given does not suffice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0548.mp3|by means of our counterparts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0549.mp3|for the understanding even of the so called mechanical or material world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0550.mp3|i do not mean as an illusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0552.mp3|but as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotions themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0553.mp3|as a more primitive form of the world of emotions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0554.mp3|in which everything still lies locked in a mighty unity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0555.mp3|which afterwards branches off and develops itself in organic processes naturally also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0556.mp3|refines and debilitates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0557.mp3|as a kind of instinctive life in which all organic functions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0558.mp3|including self regulation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0559.mp3|assimilation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0560.mp3|nutrition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0562.mp3|and change of matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0563.mp3|are still synthetically united with one another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0564.mp3|as a primary form of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0566.mp3|it is not only permitted to make this attempt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0567.mp3|it is commanded by the conscience of logical method not to assume several kinds of causality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0568.mp3|so long as the attempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to its furthest extent to absurdity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0569.mp3|if i may be allowed to say so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0570.mp3|that is a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0571.mp3|it follows from its definition as mathematicians say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0573.mp3|whether we believe in the causality of the will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0574.mp3|if we do so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0575.mp3|and fundamentally our belief in this is just our belief in causality itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0576.mp3|we must make the attempt to posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0577.mp3|will can naturally only operate on will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0578.mp3|and not on matter not on nerves for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0579.mp3|in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0580.mp3|the hypothesis must be hazarded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0582.mp3|and whether all mechanical action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0583.mp3|inasmuch as a power operates therein|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0584.mp3|is not just the power of will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0585.mp3|the effect of will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0588.mp3|that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and ramification of one fundamental form of will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0589.mp3|namely the will to power as my thesis puts it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0590.mp3|granted that all organic functions could be traced back to this will to power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0591.mp3|and that the solution of the problem of generation and nutrition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0592.mp3|it is one problem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0593.mp3|could also be found therein|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0594.mp3|one would thus have acquired the right to define all active force unequivocally as will to power the world seen from within|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0595.mp3|the world defined and designated according to its intelligible character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0596.mp3|it would simply be will to power and nothing else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0599.mp3|god is disproved but not the devil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0600.mp3|on the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0601.mp3|on the contrary my friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0602.mp3|and who the devil also compels you to speak popularly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0603.mp3|as happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern times with the french revolution that terrible farce|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0604.mp3|quite superfluous when judged close at hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0605.mp3|into which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0606.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0607.mp3|the noble and visionary spectators of all europe have interpreted from a distance their own indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0609.mp3|and perhaps only thereby make its aspect endurable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0610.mp3|or rather has not this already happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0611.mp3|have not we ourselves been that noble posterity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0612.mp3|and in so far as we now comprehend this is it not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0617.mp3|the amiable idealists who are enthusiastic about the good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0619.mp3|and beautiful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0620.mp3|and let all kinds of motley|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0622.mp3|and good natured desirabilities swim about promiscuously in their pond|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0623.mp3|happiness and virtue are no arguments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0624.mp3|it is willingly forgotten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0626.mp3|even on the part of thoughtful minds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0628.mp3|a thing could be true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0629.mp3|although it were in the highest degree injurious and dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0631.mp3|the fundamental constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full knowledge of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0632.mp3|so that the strength of a mind might be measured by the amount of truth it could endure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0633.mp3|or to speak more plainly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0634.mp3|by the extent to which it required truth attenuated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0638.mp3|and falsified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0640.mp3|not to speak of the wicked who are happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0641.mp3|a species about whom moralists are silent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0643.mp3|independent spirits and philosophers than the gentle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0644.mp3|refined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0645.mp3|yielding good nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0646.mp3|and habit of taking things easily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0649.mp3|presupposing always|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0650.mp3|to begin with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0651.mp3|that the term philosopher be not confined to the philosopher who writes books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0652.mp3|or even introduces his philosophy into books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0654.mp3|which for the sake of german taste i will not omit to underline|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0655.mp3|for it is opposed to german taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0664.mp3|everything that is profound loves the mask|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0665.mp3|the profoundest things have a hatred even of figure and likeness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0666.mp3|should not the contrary only be the right disguise for the shame of a god to go about in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0667.mp3|a question worth asking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0668.mp3|it would be strange if some mystic has not already ventured on the same kind of thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0669.mp3|there are proceedings of such a delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness and make them unrecognizable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0670.mp3|there are actions of love and of an extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take a stick and thrash the witness soundly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0671.mp3|one thereby obscures his recollection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0672.mp3|many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0673.mp3|in order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0674.mp3|shame is inventive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0675.mp3|they are not the worst things of which one is most ashamed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0677.mp3|there is so much goodness in craft|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0678.mp3|i could imagine that a man with something costly and fragile to conceal|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0682.mp3|the refinement of his shame requiring it to be so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0683.mp3|a man who has depths in his shame meets his destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0684.mp3|and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate friends may be ignorant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0685.mp3|his mortal danger conceals itself from their eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0686.mp3|and equally so his regained security|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0687.mp3|such a hidden nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0688.mp3|which instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0690.mp3|desires and insists that a mask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of his friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0691.mp3|and supposing he does not desire it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0692.mp3|his eyes will some day be opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0693.mp3|and that it is well to be so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0694.mp3|every profound spirit needs a mask|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0698.mp3|owing to the constantly false|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0699.mp3|that is to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0700.mp3|superficial interpretation of every word he utters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0701.mp3|every step he takes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0702.mp3|every sign of life he manifests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0704.mp3|and do so at the right time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0705.mp3|one must not avoid one's tests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0706.mp3|although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous game one can play|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0707.mp3|and are in the end tests made only before ourselves and before no other judge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0708.mp3|not to cleave to any person be it even the dearest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0709.mp3|every person is a prison and also a recess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0711.mp3|be it even the most suffering and necessitous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0712.mp3|it is even less difficult to detach one's heart from a victorious fatherland|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0713.mp3|not to cleave to a sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0714.mp3|be it even for higher men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0715.mp3|into whose peculiar torture and helplessness chance has given us an insight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0716.mp3|not to cleave to a science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0717.mp3|though it tempt one with the most valuable discoveries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0718.mp3|apparently specially reserved for us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0719.mp3|not to cleave to one's own liberation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0720.mp3|to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0721.mp3|which always flies further aloft in order always to see more under it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0722.mp3|the danger of the flier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0723.mp3|not to cleave to our own virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0725.mp3|to our hospitality for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0726.mp3|which is the danger of dangers for highly developed and wealthy souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0727.mp3|who deal prodigally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0728.mp3|almost indifferently with themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0729.mp3|and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes a vice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0731.mp3|a new order of philosophers is appearing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0732.mp3|i shall venture to baptize them by a name not without danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0733.mp3|as far as i understand them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0734.mp3|as far as they allow themselves to be understood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0735.mp3|for it is their nature to wish to remain something of a puzzle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0736.mp3|these philosophers of the future might rightly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0737.mp3|perhaps also wrongly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0738.mp3|claim to be designated as tempters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0739.mp3|this name itself is after all only an attempt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0741.mp3|if it be preferred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0742.mp3|a temptation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0743.mp3|will they be new friends of truth these coming philosophers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0744.mp3|very probably for all philosophers hitherto have loved their truths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0745.mp3|but assuredly they will not be dogmatists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0746.mp3|it must be contrary to their pride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0747.mp3|and also contrary to their taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0748.mp3|that their truth should still be truth for every one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0749.mp3|that which has hitherto been the secret wish and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic efforts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0750.mp3|my opinion is my opinion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0751.mp3|another person has not easily a right to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0752.mp3|such a philosopher of the future will say perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0753.mp3|one must renounce the bad taste of wishing to agree with many people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0754.mp3|good is no longer good when one's neighbour takes it into his mouth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0755.mp3|and how could there be a common good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0756.mp3|the expression contradicts itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0757.mp3|that which can be common is always of small value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0758.mp3|in the end things must be as they are and have always been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0759.mp3|the great things remain for the great|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0760.mp3|the abysses for the profound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0761.mp3|the delicacies and thrills for the refined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0763.mp3|to sum up shortly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0764.mp3|everything rare for the rare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0765.mp3|need i say expressly after all this that they will be free|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0766.mp3|very free spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0767.mp3|these philosophers of the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0768.mp3|as certainly also they will not be merely free spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0769.mp3|but something more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0770.mp3|higher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0772.mp3|and fundamentally different|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0774.mp3|but while i say this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0775.mp3|i feel under obligation almost as much to them as to ourselves we free spirits who are their heralds and forerunners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0778.mp3|like a fog|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0779.mp3|has too long made the conception of free spirit obscure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0780.mp3|in every country of europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0781.mp3|and the same in america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0782.mp3|there is at present something which makes an abuse of this name a very narrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0785.mp3|who desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instincts prompt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0786.mp3|not to mention that in respect to the new philosophers who are appearing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0787.mp3|they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0788.mp3|briefly and regrettably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0789.mp3|they belong to the levellers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0790.mp3|these wrongly named free spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0792.mp3|without personal solitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0793.mp3|blunt honest fellows to whom neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0795.mp3|they are not free|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0797.mp3|especially in their innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost all human misery and failure in the old forms in which society has hitherto existed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0798.mp3|a notion which happily inverts the truth entirely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0799.mp3|what they would fain attain with all their strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0800.mp3|is the universal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0801.mp3|green meadow happiness of the herd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0802.mp3|together with security|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0805.mp3|and alleviation of life for every one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0807.mp3|and suffering itself is looked upon by them as something which must be done away with we opposite ones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0809.mp3|who have opened our eye and conscience to the question how and where the plant man has hitherto grown most vigorously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0810.mp3|believe that this has always taken place under the opposite conditions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0811.mp3|that for this end the dangerousness of his situation had to be increased enormously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0812.mp3|his inventive faculty and dissembling power his spirit had to develop into subtlety and daring under long oppression and compulsion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0813.mp3|and his will to life had to be increased to the unconditioned will to power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0814.mp3|we believe that severity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0817.mp3|danger in the street and in the heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0819.mp3|stoicism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0825.mp3|and serpentine in man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0826.mp3|serves as well for the elevation of the human species as its opposite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0827.mp3|we do not even say enough when we only say this much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0828.mp3|and in any case we find ourselves here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0829.mp3|both with our speech and our silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0830.mp3|at the other extreme of all modern ideology and gregarious desirability|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0832.mp3|what wonder that we free spirits are not exactly the most communicative spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0833.mp3|that we do not wish to betray in every respect what a spirit can free itself from|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0834.mp3|and where perhaps it will then be driven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0835.mp3|and as to the import of the dangerous formula|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0836.mp3|beyond good and evil with which we at least avoid confusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0838.mp3|having been at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0839.mp3|or at least guests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0840.mp3|in many realms of the spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0841.mp3|having escaped again and again from the gloomy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0842.mp3|agreeable nooks in which preferences and prejudices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0843.mp3|youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0845.mp3|the accident of men and books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0846.mp3|or even the weariness of travel seemed to confine us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0851.mp3|grateful even for distress and the vicissitudes of illness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0852.mp3|because they always free us from some rule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0853.mp3|and its prejudice grateful to the god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0856.mp3|and worm in us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0857.mp3|inquisitive to a fault|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0858.mp3|investigators to the point of cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0859.mp3|with unhesitating fingers for the intangible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0860.mp3|with teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0861.mp3|ready for any business that requires sagacity and acute senses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0862.mp3|ready for every adventure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0863.mp3|owing to an excess of free will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0864.mp3|with anterior and posterior souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0865.mp3|into the ultimate intentions of which it is difficult to pry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0867.mp3|hidden ones under the mantles of light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0868.mp3|appropriators|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0870.mp3|arrangers and collectors from morning till night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0872.mp3|economical in learning and forgetting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0873.mp3|inventive in scheming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0874.mp3|sometimes proud of tables of categories|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0875.mp3|sometimes pedants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0876.mp3|sometimes night owls of work even in full day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0879.mp3|even scarecrows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_02_nietzsche_0880.mp3|and it is necessary nowadays|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0007.mp3|this is the preordained hunting domain for a born psychologist and lover of a big hunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0008.mp3|but how often must he say despairingly to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0009.mp3|a single individual|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0014.mp3|that he could send into the history of the human soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0015.mp3|to drive his game together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0017.mp3|again and again he experiences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0018.mp3|profoundly and bitterly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0019.mp3|how difficult it is to find assistants and dogs for all the things that directly excite his curiosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0020.mp3|the evil of sending scholars into new and dangerous hunting domains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0023.mp3|and subtlety in every sense are required|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0024.mp3|is that they are no longer serviceable just when the big hunt and also the great danger commences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0025.mp3|it is precisely then that they lose their keen eye and nose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0027.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0029.mp3|a person would perhaps himself have to possess as profound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0030.mp3|as bruised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0031.mp3|as immense an experience as the intellectual conscience of pascal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0033.mp3|wicked spirituality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0035.mp3|from above|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0036.mp3|would be able to oversee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0038.mp3|and effectively formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0039.mp3|but who could do me this service|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0040.mp3|and who would have time to wait for such servants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0041.mp3|they evidently appear too rarely they are so improbable at all times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0043.mp3|which means that one has much to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0044.mp3|but a curiosity like mine is once for all the most agreeable of vices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0045.mp3|pardon me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0046.mp3|i mean to say that the love of truth has its reward in heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0047.mp3|and already upon earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0049.mp3|such as early christianity desired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0051.mp3|which had centuries of struggle between philosophical schools behind it and in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0053.mp3|this faith is not that sincere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0054.mp3|austere slave faith by which perhaps a luther or a cromwell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0055.mp3|or some other northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his god and christianity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0056.mp3|it is much rather the faith of pascal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0057.mp3|which resembles in a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0060.mp3|worm like reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0061.mp3|which is not to be slain at once and with a single blow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0065.mp3|all self confidence of spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0066.mp3|it is at the same time subjection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0068.mp3|and self mutilation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0069.mp3|there is cruelty and religious phoenicianism in this faith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0070.mp3|which is adapted to a tender|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0072.mp3|and very fastidious conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0073.mp3|it takes for granted that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably painful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0075.mp3|in the form of which faith comes to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0077.mp3|with their obtuseness as regards all christian nomenclature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0078.mp3|have no longer the sense for the terribly superlative conception which was implied to an antique taste by the paradox of the formula|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0081.mp3|nor anything at once so dreadful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0083.mp3|and questionable as this formula|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0084.mp3|it promised a transvaluation of all ancient values|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0085.mp3|it was the orient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0086.mp3|the profound orient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0088.mp3|light minded toleration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0089.mp3|on the roman catholicism of non faith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0090.mp3|and it was always not the faith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0091.mp3|but the freedom from the faith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0092.mp3|the half stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0093.mp3|which made the slaves indignant at their masters and revolt against them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0094.mp3|enlightenment causes revolt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0095.mp3|for the slave desires the unconditioned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0097.mp3|even in morals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0098.mp3|he loves as he hates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0099.mp3|without nuance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0100.mp3|to the very depths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0101.mp3|to the point of pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0102.mp3|to the point of sickness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0103.mp3|his many hidden sufferings make him revolt against the noble taste which seems to deny suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0105.mp3|fundamentally only an attitude of aristocratic morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0106.mp3|was not the least of the causes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0108.mp3|of the last great slave insurrection which began with the french revolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0109.mp3|wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so far|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0110.mp3|we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0111.mp3|solitude fasting and sexual abstinence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0112.mp3|but without its being possible to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0113.mp3|or if any relation at all of cause and effect exists there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0115.mp3|which then with equal suddenness transforms into penitential paroxysms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0116.mp3|world renunciation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0117.mp3|and will renunciation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0118.mp3|both symptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0119.mp3|but nowhere is it more obligatory to put aside explanations around no other type has there grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0120.mp3|no other type seems to have been more interesting to men and even to philosophers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0121.mp3|perhaps it is time to become just a little indifferent here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0122.mp3|to learn caution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0126.mp3|yet in the background of the most recent philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0127.mp3|that of schopenhauer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0128.mp3|we find almost as the problem in itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0129.mp3|this terrible note of interrogation of the religious crisis and awakening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0131.mp3|how is the saint possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0132.mp3|that seems to have been the very question with which schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0135.mp3|as far as germany is concerned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0138.mp3|should bring his own life work to an end just here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0141.mp3|and as it loved and lived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0142.mp3|at the very time that the mad doctors in almost all european countries had an opportunity to study the type close at hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0143.mp3|wherever the religious neurosis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0144.mp3|or as i call it the religious mood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0145.mp3|made its latest epidemical outbreak and display as the salvation army|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0146.mp3|if it be a question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0147.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0148.mp3|as to what has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0149.mp3|and even to philosophers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0150.mp3|in the whole phenomenon of the saint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0151.mp3|it is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0153.mp3|the immediate succession of opposites|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0155.mp3|it was believed here to be self evident that a bad man was all at once turned into a saint a good man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0156.mp3|the hitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0157.mp3|is it not possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed itself under the dominion of morals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0158.mp3|because it believed in oppositions of moral values|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0159.mp3|and saw|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0161.mp3|and interpreted these oppositions into the text and facts of the case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0163.mp3|miracle only an error of interpretation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0166.mp3|and that consequently unbelief in catholic countries means something quite different from what it does among protestants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0169.mp3|while with us it is rather a return to the spirit or non spirit of the race|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0170.mp3|we northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0171.mp3|even as regards our talents for religion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0172.mp3|we have poor talents for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0173.mp3|one may make an exception in the case of the celts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0174.mp3|who have theretofore furnished also the best soil for christian infection in the north|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0177.mp3|whenever there is any celtic blood in their origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0178.mp3|how catholic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0180.mp3|with the roman logic of its instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0181.mp3|how jesuitical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0182.mp3|that amiable and shrewd cicerone of port royal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0184.mp3|in spite of all his hostility to jesuits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0187.mp3|in whom every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throws his refined voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off its balance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0188.mp3|let us repeat after him these fine sentences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0189.mp3|and what wickedness and haughtiness is immediately aroused by way of answer in our probably less beautiful but harder souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0191.mp3|in our more german souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0197.mp3|that in my first impulse of rage on finding them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0198.mp3|i wrote on the margin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0199.mp3|until in my later rage i even took a fancy to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0202.mp3|that which is so astonishing in the religious life of the ancient greeks is the irrestrainable stream of gratitude which it pours forth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0205.mp3|when the populace got the upper hand in greece|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0206.mp3|fear became rampant also in religion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0207.mp3|and christianity was preparing itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0208.mp3|the passion for god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0210.mp3|honest hearted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0211.mp3|and importunate kinds of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0212.mp3|like that of luther|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0217.mp3|who lacks in an offensive manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0218.mp3|all nobility in bearing and desires|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0219.mp3|there is a feminine tenderness and sensuality in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0222.mp3|in many cases it appears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0223.mp3|curiously enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0225.mp3|here and there even as the hysteria of an old maid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0227.mp3|the church has frequently canonized the woman in such a case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0228.mp3|the mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before the saint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0229.mp3|as the enigma of self subjugation and utter voluntary privation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0230.mp3|why did they thus bow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0232.mp3|and as it were behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0233.mp3|the superior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0234.mp3|the strength of will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0235.mp3|in which they recognized their own strength and love of power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0236.mp3|and knew how to honour it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0238.mp3|in addition to this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0239.mp3|the contemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0240.mp3|such an enormity of self negation and anti naturalness will not have been coveted for nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0241.mp3|they have said inquiringly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0242.mp3|there is perhaps a reason for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0243.mp3|some very great danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0245.mp3|in a word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0246.mp3|the mighty ones of the world learned to have a new fear before him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0247.mp3|they divined a new power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0249.mp3|still unconquered enemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0250.mp3|it was the will to power which obliged them to halt before the saint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0251.mp3|they had to question him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0252.mp3|in the jewish old testament the book of divine justice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0255.mp3|and sayings on such an immense scale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0256.mp3|that greek and indian literature has nothing to compare with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0257.mp3|one stands with fear and reverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0260.mp3|by all means|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0261.mp3|to figure before asia as the progress of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0262.mp3|to be sure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0263.mp3|he who is himself only a slender|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0266.mp3|including the christians of cultured christianity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0267.mp3|need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0268.mp3|the taste for the old testament is a touchstone with respect to great and small|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0269.mp3|perhaps he will find that the new testament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0270.mp3|the book of grace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0271.mp3|still appeals more to his heart there is much of the odour of the genuine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0273.mp3|stupid beadsman and petty soul in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0275.mp3|as the bible as the book in itself is perhaps the greatest audacity and sin against the spirit which literary europe has upon its conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0276.mp3|why atheism nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0277.mp3|the father in god is thoroughly refuted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0278.mp3|equally so the judge the rewarder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0279.mp3|also his free will he does not hear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0280.mp3|and even if he did he would not know how to help|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0281.mp3|the worst is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0283.mp3|this is what i have made out by questioning and listening at a variety of conversations to be the cause of the decline of european theism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0284.mp3|it appears to me that though the religious instinct is in vigorous growth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0285.mp3|it rejects the theistic satisfaction with profound distrust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0286.mp3|what does all modern philosophy mainly do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0288.mp3|and indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0293.mp3|modern philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0295.mp3|is secretly or openly anti christian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0296.mp3|although for keener ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0302.mp3|i is the condition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0303.mp3|think is the predicate and is conditioned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0304.mp3|to think is an activity for which one must suppose a subject as cause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0305.mp3|the attempt was then made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0306.mp3|with marvelous tenacity and subtlety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0307.mp3|to see if one could not get out of this net|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0308.mp3|to see if the opposite was not perhaps true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0309.mp3|think the condition and i the conditioned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0310.mp3|i therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0311.mp3|only a synthesis which has been made by thinking itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0313.mp3|starting from the subject|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0314.mp3|the subject could not be proved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0315.mp3|nor the object either|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0316.mp3|the possibility of an apparent existence of the subject|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0317.mp3|and therefore of the soul may not always have been strange to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0318.mp3|the thought which once had an immense power on earth as the vedanta philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0319.mp3|there is a great ladder of religious cruelty with many rounds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0320.mp3|but three of these are the most important|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0321.mp3|once on a time men sacrificed human beings to their god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0322.mp3|and perhaps just those they loved the best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0323.mp3|to this category belong the firstling sacrifices of all primitive religions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0326.mp3|then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0327.mp3|during the moral epoch of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0328.mp3|they sacrificed to their god the strongest instincts they possessed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0336.mp3|all faith in hidden harmonies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0337.mp3|in future blessedness and justice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0338.mp3|was it not necessary to sacrifice god himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0339.mp3|and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0340.mp3|stupidity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0342.mp3|fate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0344.mp3|to sacrifice god for nothingness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0345.mp3|this paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for the rising generation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0346.mp3|we all know something thereof already|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0348.mp3|like myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0349.mp3|prompted by some enigmatical desire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0350.mp3|has long endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it from the half christian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0351.mp3|half german narrowness and stupidity in which it has finally presented itself to this century|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0355.mp3|with an asiatic and super asiatic eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0356.mp3|has actually looked inside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0358.mp3|beyond good and evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0359.mp3|and no longer like buddha and schopenhauer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0360.mp3|under the dominion and delusion of morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0361.mp3|whoever has done this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0362.mp3|has perhaps just thereby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0363.mp3|without really desiring it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0364.mp3|opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0365.mp3|the ideal of the most world approving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0368.mp3|who has not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was and is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0369.mp3|but wishes to have it again as it was and is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0370.mp3|for all eternity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0372.mp3|not only to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0374.mp3|and not only the play but actually to him who requires the play|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0375.mp3|and makes it necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0376.mp3|because he always requires himself anew and makes himself necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0380.mp3|and as it were the space around man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0382.mp3|his world becomes profounder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0383.mp3|new stars new enigmas and notions are ever coming into view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0384.mp3|perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercised its acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion for its exercise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0385.mp3|something of a game|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0386.mp3|something for children and childish minds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0387.mp3|perhaps the most solemn conceptions that have caused the most fighting and suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0388.mp3|the conceptions god and sin will one day seem to us of no more importance than a child's plaything or a child's pain seems to an old man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0389.mp3|and perhaps another plaything and another pain will then be necessary once more for the old man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0390.mp3|always childish enough an eternal child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0391.mp3|has it been observed to what extent outward idleness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0392.mp3|or semi idleness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0394.mp3|and for its soft placidity called prayer the state of perpetual readiness for the coming of god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0395.mp3|i mean the idleness with a good conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0396.mp3|the idleness of olden times and of blood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0397.mp3|to which the aristocratic sentiment that work is dishonouring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0398.mp3|that it vulgarizes body and soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0399.mp3|is not quite unfamiliar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0400.mp3|and that consequently the modern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0403.mp3|conceited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0404.mp3|foolishly proud laboriousness educates and prepares for unbelief more than anything else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0406.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0407.mp3|who are at present living apart from religion in germany|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0408.mp3|i find free thinkers of diversified species and origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0409.mp3|but above all a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation has dissolved the religious instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0410.mp3|so that they no longer know what purpose religions serve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0411.mp3|and only note their existence in the world with a kind of dull astonishment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0413.mp3|these good people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0414.mp3|be it by their business or by their pleasures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0415.mp3|not to mention the fatherland and the newspapers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0416.mp3|and their family duties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0419.mp3|it is not obvious to them whether it is a question of a new business or a new pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0420.mp3|for it is impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0421.mp3|they say to themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0422.mp3|that people should go to church merely to spoil their tempers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0423.mp3|they are by no means enemies of religious customs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0424.mp3|should certain circumstances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0425.mp3|state affairs perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0426.mp3|require their participation in such customs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0427.mp3|they do what is required|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0428.mp3|as so many things are done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0429.mp3|with a patient and unassuming seriousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0430.mp3|and without much curiosity or discomfort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0431.mp3|they live too much apart and outside to feel even the necessity for a for or against in such matters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0432.mp3|among those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority of german protestants of the middle classes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0433.mp3|especially in the great laborious centres of trade and commerce|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0434.mp3|also the majority of laborious scholars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0435.mp3|and the entire university personnel with the exception of the theologians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0436.mp3|whose existence and possibility there always gives psychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0438.mp3|or merely church going people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0439.mp3|there is seldom any idea of how much good will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0440.mp3|one might say arbitrary will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0441.mp3|is now necessary for a german scholar to take the problem of religion seriously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0442.mp3|his whole profession and as i have said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0443.mp3|his whole workmanlike laboriousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0444.mp3|to which he is compelled by his modern conscience inclines him to a lofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0445.mp3|with which is occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the uncleanliness of spirit which he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belong to the church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0446.mp3|it is only with the help of history not through his own personal experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0447.mp3|therefore that the scholar succeeds in bringing himself to a respectful seriousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0448.mp3|and to a certain timid deference in presence of religions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0450.mp3|he has not personally advanced one step nearer to that which still maintains itself as church or as piety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0451.mp3|perhaps even the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0452.mp3|the practical indifference to religious matters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0453.mp3|usually sublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0454.mp3|which shuns contact with religious men and things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0455.mp3|and it may be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0457.mp3|for the discovery of which other ages may envy it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0462.mp3|in the good conscience of his tolerance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0463.mp3|in the unsuspecting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0464.mp3|simple certainty with which his instinct treats the religious man as a lower and less valuable type|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0465.mp3|beyond|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0466.mp3|before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0467.mp3|and above which he himself has developed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0469.mp3|the little arrogant dwarf and mob man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0470.mp3|the sedulously alert|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0471.mp3|head and hand drudge of ideas of modern ideas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0472.mp3|whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0473.mp3|it is their preservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0476.mp3|here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adoration of pure forms in philosophers as well as in artists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0477.mp3|it is not to be doubted that whoever has need of the cult of the superficial to that extent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0478.mp3|has at one time or another made an unlucky dive beneath it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0479.mp3|perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0480.mp3|the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying to falsify its image as if taking wearisome revenge on it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0481.mp3|one might guess to what degree life has disgusted them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0482.mp3|by the extent to which they wish to see its image falsified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0483.mp3|attenuated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0487.mp3|as their highest rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0488.mp3|it is the profound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0489.mp3|suspicious fear of an incurable pessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a religious interpretation of existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0490.mp3|the fear of the instinct which divines that truth might be attained too soon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0491.mp3|before man has become strong enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0493.mp3|artist enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0495.mp3|the life in god regarded in this light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0496.mp3|would appear as the most elaborate and ultimate product of the fear of truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0497.mp3|as artist adoration and artist intoxication in presence of the most logical of all falsifications|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0498.mp3|as the will to the inversion of truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0499.mp3|to untruth at any price|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0500.mp3|perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective means of beautifying man than piety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0501.mp3|by means of it man can become so artful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0502.mp3|so superficial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0504.mp3|and so good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0505.mp3|that his appearance no longer offends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0506.mp3|to love mankind for god's sake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0507.mp3|this has so far been the noblest and remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0509.mp3|without any redeeming intention in the background|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0510.mp3|is only an additional folly and brutishness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0511.mp3|that the inclination to this love has first to get its proportion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0512.mp3|its delicacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0514.mp3|whoever first perceived and experienced this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0515.mp3|however his tongue may have stammered as it attempted to express such a delicate matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0516.mp3|let him for all time be holy and respected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0518.mp3|the philosopher as we free spirits understand him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0519.mp3|as the man of the greatest responsibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0520.mp3|who has the conscience for the general development of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0521.mp3|will use religion for his disciplining and educating work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0522.mp3|just as he will use the contemporary political and economic conditions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0523.mp3|the selecting and disciplining influence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0524.mp3|destructive as well as creative and fashioning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0525.mp3|which can be exercised by means of religion is manifold and varied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0526.mp3|according to the sort of people placed under its spell and protection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0527.mp3|for those who are strong and independent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0528.mp3|destined and trained to command|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0529.mp3|in whom the judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0530.mp3|religion is an additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of authority|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0531.mp3|as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0532.mp3|betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0534.mp3|which would fain escape obedience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0535.mp3|and in the case of the unique natures of noble origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0536.mp3|if by virtue of superior spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0537.mp3|reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of government over chosen disciples or members of an order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0538.mp3|religion itself may be used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of managing grosser affairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0539.mp3|and for securing immunity from the unavoidable filth of all political agitation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0540.mp3|the brahmins for instance understood this fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0541.mp3|with the help of a religious organization|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0542.mp3|they secured to themselves the power of nominating kings for the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0543.mp3|while their sentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0545.mp3|at the same time religion gives inducement and opportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for future ruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0546.mp3|in which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0547.mp3|through fortunate marriage customs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0548.mp3|volitional power and delight in self control are on the increase|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0549.mp3|to them religion offers sufficient incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0550.mp3|and to experience the sentiments of authoritative self control|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0551.mp3|of silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0552.mp3|and of solitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0554.mp3|and finally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0555.mp3|to ordinary men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0556.mp3|to the majority of the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0557.mp3|who exist for service and general utility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0560.mp3|peace of heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0561.mp3|ennoblement of obedience|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0563.mp3|with something of transfiguration and embellishment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0564.mp3|something of justification of all the commonplaceness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0565.mp3|all the meanness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0566.mp3|all the semi animal poverty of their souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0568.mp3|together with the religious significance of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0570.mp3|and makes even their own aspect endurable to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0571.mp3|it operates upon them as the epicurean philosophy usually operates upon sufferers of a higher order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0572.mp3|in a refreshing and refining manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0573.mp3|almost turning suffering to account|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0574.mp3|and in the end even hallowing and vindicating it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0575.mp3|there is perhaps nothing so admirable in christianity and buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0576.mp3|and thereby to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it difficult enough to live|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0577.mp3|this very difficulty being necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0579.mp3|to make also the bad counter reckoning against such religions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0580.mp3|and to bring to light their secret dangers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0581.mp3|the cost is always excessive and terrible when religions do not operate as an educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0582.mp3|but rule voluntarily and paramountly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0583.mp3|when they wish to be the final end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0584.mp3|and not a means along with other means|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0585.mp3|among men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0586.mp3|as among all other animals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0587.mp3|there is a surplus of defective|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0610.mp3|they take the part of these upon principle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0611.mp3|they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a disease|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0650.mp3|equally coarse and refined comedy of european christianity with the derisive and impartial eye of an epicurean god|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_03_nietzsche_0667.mp3|i should say that christianity has hitherto been the most portentous of presumptions|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_04_nietzsche_0025.mp3|which always recurs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_04_nietzsche_0027.mp3|it is not the strength|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0009.mp3|an interesting contrast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0010.mp3|which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious in the very person of a moralist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0011.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0012.mp3|the expression|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0014.mp3|in respect to what is designated thereby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0015.mp3|far too presumptuous and counter to good taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0016.mp3|which is always a foretaste of more modest expressions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0017.mp3|one ought to avow with the utmost fairness what is still necessary here for a long time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0018.mp3|what is alone proper for the present|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0027.mp3|and perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common forms of these living crystallizations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0028.mp3|as preparation for a theory of types of morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0029.mp3|to be sure people have not hitherto been so modest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0030.mp3|all the philosophers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0031.mp3|with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0032.mp3|demanded of themselves something very much higher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0034.mp3|and ceremonious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0035.mp3|when they concerned themselves with morality as a science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0037.mp3|and every philosopher hitherto has believed that he has given it a basis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0038.mp3|morality itself however has been regarded as something given|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0039.mp3|how far from their awkward pride was the seemingly insignificant problem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0040.mp3|left in dust and decay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0041.mp3|of a description of forms of morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0042.mp3|notwithstanding that the finest hands and senses could hardly be fine enough for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0044.mp3|in an arbitrary epitome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0045.mp3|or an accidental abridgement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0047.mp3|their position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0050.mp3|their climate and zone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0051.mp3|it was precisely because they were badly instructed with regard to nations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0053.mp3|and past ages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0054.mp3|and were by no means eager to know about these matters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0055.mp3|that they did not even come in sight of the real problems of morals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0056.mp3|problems which only disclose themselves by a comparison of many kinds of morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0057.mp3|in every science of morals hitherto|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0058.mp3|strange as it may sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0059.mp3|the problem of morality itself has been omitted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0060.mp3|there has been no suspicion that there was anything problematic there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0061.mp3|that which philosophers called giving a basis to morality and endeavoured to realize|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0062.mp3|has|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0063.mp3|when seen in a right light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0065.mp3|a new means of its expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0066.mp3|consequently just a matter of fact within the sphere of a definite morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0068.mp3|in its ultimate motive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0069.mp3|a sort of denial that it is lawful for this morality to be called in question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0070.mp3|and in any case the reverse of the testing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0073.mp3|and vivisecting of this very faith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0075.mp3|almost worthy of honour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0076.mp3|schopenhauer represents his own task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0077.mp3|and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of a science whose latest master still talks in the strain of children and old wives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0079.mp3|the axiom about the purport of which all moralists are practically agreed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0081.mp3|is really the proposition which all moral teachers strive to establish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0082.mp3|the real basis of ethics which has been sought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0083.mp3|like the philosopher's stone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0084.mp3|for centuries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0085.mp3|the difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be great|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0086.mp3|it is well known that schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his efforts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0087.mp3|and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and sentimental this proposition is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0088.mp3|in a world whose essence is will to power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0089.mp3|may be reminded that schopenhauer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0090.mp3|although a pessimist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0091.mp3|played the flute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0092.mp3|daily after dinner one may read about the matter in his biography|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0093.mp3|a question by the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0096.mp3|who makes a halt at morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0097.mp3|who assents to morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0099.mp3|what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0100.mp3|is that really a pessimist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0101.mp3|apart from the value of such assertions as there is a categorical imperative in us one can always ask|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0102.mp3|what does such an assertion indicate about him who makes it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0106.mp3|with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0107.mp3|with others he wishes to take revenge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0108.mp3|with others to conceal himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0110.mp3|this system of morals helps its author to forget|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0111.mp3|that system makes him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0112.mp3|or something of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0113.mp3|forgotten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0114.mp3|many a moralist would like to exercise power and creative arbitrariness over mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0115.mp3|many another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0116.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0119.mp3|is that i know how to obey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0120.mp3|and with you it shall not be otherwise than with me in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0121.mp3|systems of morals are only a sign language of the emotions one hundred eighty eight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0123.mp3|every system of morals is a sort of tyranny against nature and also against reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0126.mp3|no objection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0128.mp3|that all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful what is essential and invaluable in every system of morals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0129.mp3|is that it is a long constraint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0130.mp3|in order to understand stoicism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0131.mp3|or port royal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0132.mp3|or puritanism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0133.mp3|one should remember the constraint under which every language has attained to strength and freedom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0134.mp3|the metrical constraint the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0135.mp3|how much trouble have the poets and orators of every nation given themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0137.mp3|in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0138.mp3|for the sake of a folly as utilitarian bunglers say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0139.mp3|and thereby deem themselves wise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0140.mp3|from submission to arbitrary laws as the anarchists say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0141.mp3|and thereby fancy themselves free even free spirited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0142.mp3|the singular fact remains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0143.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0148.mp3|and masterly certainty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0149.mp3|which exists or has existed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0150.mp3|whether it be in thought itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0151.mp3|or in administration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0152.mp3|or in speaking and persuading|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0153.mp3|in art just as in conduct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0154.mp3|has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0155.mp3|and in all seriousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0156.mp3|it is not at all improbable that precisely this is nature and natural|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0158.mp3|every artist knows how different from the state of letting himself go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0159.mp3|is his most natural condition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0160.mp3|the free arranging|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0161.mp3|locating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0163.mp3|and constructing in the moments of inspiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0164.mp3|and how strictly and delicately he then obeys a thousand laws|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0165.mp3|which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0168.mp3|in comparison therewith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0169.mp3|something floating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0171.mp3|and ambiguous in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0172.mp3|the essential thing in heaven and in earth is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0173.mp3|apparently to repeat it once more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0174.mp3|that there should be long obedience in the same direction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0175.mp3|there thereby results|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0176.mp3|and has always resulted in the long run|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0177.mp3|something which has made life worth living|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0178.mp3|for instance virtue art music dancing reason spirituality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0179.mp3|anything whatever that is transfiguring refined foolish or divine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0180.mp3|the long bondage of the spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0181.mp3|the distrustful constraint in the communicability of ideas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0182.mp3|the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance with the rules of a church or a court|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0259.mp3|here also is a hint for the explanation of the paradox|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0260.mp3|why it was precisely in the most christian period of european history|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0261.mp3|and in general only under the pressure of christian sentiments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0263.mp3|there is something in the morality of plato which does not really belong to plato|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0266.mp3|in spite of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0268.mp3|no one desires to injure himself hence all evil is done unwittingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0269.mp3|the evil man inflicts injury on himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0270.mp3|he would not do so however if he knew that evil is evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0271.mp3|the evil man therefore is only evil through error|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0272.mp3|if one free him from error one will necessarily make him good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0274.mp3|who perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil doing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0275.mp3|and practically judge that it is stupid to do wrong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0276.mp3|while they accept good as identical with useful and pleasant without further thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0277.mp3|as regards every system of utilitarianism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0278.mp3|one may at once assume that it has the same origin|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0280.mp3|one will seldom err|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0281.mp3|plato did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the tenets of his teacher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0282.mp3|and above all to interpret himself into them|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0285.mp3|who lifted the entire socrates out of the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0286.mp3|as a popular theme and song|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0288.mp3|namely in all his own disguises and multiplicities|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0291.mp3|what is the platonic socrates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0292.mp3|if not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0293.mp3|the old theological problem of faith and knowledge or more plainly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0294.mp3|of instinct and reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0295.mp3|the question whether|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0297.mp3|instinct deserves more authority than rationality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0298.mp3|which wants to appreciate and act according to motives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0300.mp3|in conformity to purpose and utility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0301.mp3|it is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of socrates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0302.mp3|and had divided men's minds long before christianity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0303.mp3|socrates himself following of course the taste of his talent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0304.mp3|that of a surpassing dialectician|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0305.mp3|took first the side of reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0307.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0308.mp3|what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the noble athenians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0309.mp3|who were men of instinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0310.mp3|like all noble men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0311.mp3|and could never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0314.mp3|though silently and secretly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0315.mp3|he laughed also at himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0316.mp3|with his finer conscience and introspection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0317.mp3|he found in himself the same difficulty and incapacity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0318.mp3|but why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0319.mp3|he said to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0320.mp3|should one on that account separate oneself from the instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0321.mp3|one must set them right and the reason also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0322.mp3|one must follow the instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0323.mp3|but at the same time persuade the reason to support them with good arguments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0324.mp3|this was the real falseness of that great and mysterious ironist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0325.mp3|he brought his conscience up to the point that he was satisfied with a kind of self outwitting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0326.mp3|in fact he perceived the irrationality in the moral judgment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0327.mp3|plato|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0328.mp3|more innocent in such matters|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0331.mp3|at the expenditure of all his strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0333.mp3|that reason and instinct lead spontaneously to one goal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0334.mp3|to the good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0335.mp3|to god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0336.mp3|and since plato|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0337.mp3|all theologians and philosophers have followed the same path|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0338.mp3|which means that in matters of morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0339.mp3|instinct or as christians call it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0340.mp3|faith or as i call it|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0344.mp3|who recognized only the authority of reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0346.mp3|whoever has followed the history of a single science|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0363.mp3|when we hear another language spoken|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0380.mp3|we find it so much easier to fancy the chance of a tree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0381.mp3|even in the midst of the most remarkable experiences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0382.mp3|we still do just the same|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0383.mp3|we fabricate the greater part of the experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0384.mp3|and can hardly be made to contemplate any event|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0385.mp3|except as inventors thereof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0386.mp3|all this goes to prove that from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we have been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0387.mp3|accustomed to lying or|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0388.mp3|to express it more politely and hypocritically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0390.mp3|more pleasantly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0391.mp3|one is much more of an artist than one is aware of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0392.mp3|in an animated conversation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0393.mp3|i often see the face of the person with whom i am speaking so clearly and sharply defined before me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0394.mp3|according to the thought he expresses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0395.mp3|or which i believe to be evoked in his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0396.mp3|that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the strength of my visual faculty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0398.mp3|probably the person put on quite a different expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0399.mp3|or none at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0401.mp3|what we experience in dreams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0402.mp3|provided we experience it often|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0403.mp3|pertains at last just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anything actually experienced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0404.mp3|by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0405.mp3|we have a requirement more or less|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0406.mp3|and finally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0407.mp3|in broad daylight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0408.mp3|and even in the brightest moments of our waking life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0409.mp3|we are ruled to some extent by the nature of our dreams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0410.mp3|supposing that someone has often flown in his dreams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0411.mp3|and that at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0412.mp3|as soon as he dreams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0413.mp3|he is conscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and his peculiarly enviable happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0414.mp3|such a person|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0415.mp3|who believes that on the slightest impulse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0416.mp3|he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0417.mp3|who knows the sensation of a certain divine levity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0419.mp3|a downwards without descending or lowering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0420.mp3|without trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0421.mp3|how could the man with such dream experiences and dream habits fail to find happiness differently coloured and defined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0422.mp3|even in his waking hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0423.mp3|how could he fail to long differently for happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0426.mp3|when compared with his own flying be far too earthly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0429.mp3|far too troublesome for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0430.mp3|the difference among men does not manifest itself only in the difference of their lists of desirable things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0431.mp3|in their regarding different good things as worth striving for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0432.mp3|and being disagreed as to the greater or less value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0433.mp3|the order of rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0434.mp3|of the commonly recognized desirable things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0435.mp3|it manifests itself much more in what they regard as actually having and possessing a desirable thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0436.mp3|as regards a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0437.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0438.mp3|the control over her body and her sexual gratification serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the more modest man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0439.mp3|another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for possession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0441.mp3|and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially whether the woman not only gives herself to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0442.mp3|but also gives up for his sake what she has or would like to have|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0443.mp3|only then does he look upon her as possessed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0444.mp3|a third|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0445.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0446.mp3|has not even here got to the limit of his distrust and his desire for possession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0447.mp3|he asks himself whether the woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0448.mp3|when she gives up everything for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0449.mp3|does not perhaps do so for a phantom of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0450.mp3|he wishes first to be thoroughly indeed profoundly well known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0451.mp3|in order to be loved at all he ventures to let himself be found out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0452.mp3|only then does he feel the beloved one fully in his possession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0453.mp3|when she no longer deceives herself about him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0454.mp3|when she loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed insatiability|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0455.mp3|as for his goodness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0457.mp3|and spirituality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0458.mp3|one man would like to possess a nation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0459.mp3|and he finds all the higher arts of cagliostro and catalina suitable for his purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0460.mp3|another with a more refined thirst for possession says to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0461.mp3|one may not deceive where one desires to possess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0462.mp3|he is irritated and impatient at the idea that a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0465.mp3|make myself known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0467.mp3|one almost always finds the awkward craftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0470.mp3|he should merit help|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0471.mp3|seek just their help|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0472.mp3|and would show himself deeply grateful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0474.mp3|and subservient to them for all help|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0476.mp3|they take control of the needy as a property|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0477.mp3|just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a desire for property|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0478.mp3|one finds them jealous when they are crossed or forestalled in their charity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0479.mp3|parents involuntarily make something like themselves out of their children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0480.mp3|they call that education|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0481.mp3|no mother doubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is thereby her property|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0484.mp3|in former times fathers deemed it right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly born as among the ancient germans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0485.mp3|and like the father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0486.mp3|so also do the teacher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0487.mp3|the class|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0489.mp3|and the prince still see in every new individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0490.mp3|the consequence is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0491.mp3|the jews|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0492.mp3|a people born for slavery as tacitus and the whole ancient world say of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0493.mp3|the chosen people among the nations as they themselves say and believe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0494.mp3|the jews performed the miracle of the inversion of valuations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0495.mp3|by means of which life on earth obtained a new and dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0497.mp3|in this inversion of valuations in which is also included the use of the word poor as synonymous with saint and friend the significance of the jewish people is to be found|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0498.mp3|it is with them that the slave insurrection in morals commences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0500.mp3|such as we shall never see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0501.mp3|among ourselves this is an allegory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0502.mp3|and the psychologist of morals reads the whole star writing merely as an allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0503.mp3|the beast of prey and the man of prey for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0505.mp3|nature is misunderstood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0506.mp3|so long as one seeks a morbidness in the constitution of these healthiest of all tropical monsters and growths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0507.mp3|or even an innate hell in them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0508.mp3|as almost all moralists have done hitherto|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0509.mp3|does it not seem that there is a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0510.mp3|and that the tropical man must be discredited at all costs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0511.mp3|whether as disease and deterioration of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0515.mp3|in favour of the temperate men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0516.mp3|the moral|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0517.mp3|the mediocre|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0518.mp3|this for the chapter morals as timidity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0520.mp3|what else are they but suggestions for behaviour adapted to the degree of danger from themselves in which the individuals live|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0522.mp3|their good and bad propensities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0524.mp3|small and great expediencies and elaborations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0525.mp3|permeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old wife wisdom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0526.mp3|all of them grotesque and absurd in their form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0528.mp3|all of them speaking unconditionally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0529.mp3|and taking themselves unconditionally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0531.mp3|but rather endurable only|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0532.mp3|and sometimes even seductive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0534.mp3|especially of the other world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0535.mp3|that is all of little value when estimated intellectually|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0536.mp3|and is far from being science much less wisdom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0538.mp3|repeated once more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0539.mp3|and three times repeated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0540.mp3|it is expediency|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0545.mp3|stupidity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0546.mp3|whether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness towards the heated folly of the emotions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0547.mp3|which the stoics advised and fostered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0548.mp3|or the no more laughing and no more weeping of spinoza|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0550.mp3|which he recommended so naively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0551.mp3|or the lowering of the emotions to an innocent mean at which they may be satisfied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0553.mp3|or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntary attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0554.mp3|perhaps as music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0555.mp3|or as love of god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0556.mp3|and of mankind for god's sake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0557.mp3|for in religion the passions are once more enfranchised provided that|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0565.mp3|this also for the chapter morals as timidity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0566.mp3|inasmuch as in all ages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0567.mp3|as long as mankind has existed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0568.mp3|there have also been human herds family alliances|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0574.mp3|and always a great number who obey in proportion to the small number who command|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0578.mp3|one may reasonably suppose that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0579.mp3|generally speaking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0580.mp3|the need thereof is now innate in every one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0581.mp3|as a kind of formal conscience which gives the command thou shalt unconditionally do something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0582.mp3|unconditionally refrain from something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0583.mp3|in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0584.mp3|thou shalt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0585.mp3|this need tries to satisfy itself and to fill its form with a content|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0586.mp3|according to its strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0589.mp3|it at once seizes as an omnivorous appetite with little selection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0590.mp3|and accepts whatever is shouted into its ear by all sorts of commanders|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0592.mp3|the extraordinary limitation of human development|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0596.mp3|and turning thereof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0597.mp3|is attributable to the fact that the herd instinct of obedience is transmitted best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0598.mp3|and at the cost of the art of command|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0599.mp3|if one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0600.mp3|commanders and independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0602.mp3|and will have to impose a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to command just as if they also were only obeying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0603.mp3|this condition of things actually exists in europe at present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0604.mp3|i call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding class|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0605.mp3|they know no other way of protecting themselves from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older and higher orders of predecessors|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0613.mp3|the gregarious european man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only kind of man that is allowable|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0630.mp3|attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative constitutions|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0636.mp3|is the appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious europeans|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0665.mp3|they have also inherited and indoctrinated into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict with themselves that is to say|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0677.mp3|comes to the front|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0678.mp3|the two types are complementary to each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0679.mp3|and spring from the same causes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0680.mp3|as long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only gregarious utility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0681.mp3|as long as the preservation of the community is only kept in view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0683.mp3|there can be no morality of love to one's neighbour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0684.mp3|granted even that there is already a little constant exercise of consideration|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0689.mp3|granted that even in this condition of society all those instincts are already active which are latterly distinguished by honourable names as virtues and eventually almost coincide with the conception morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0690.mp3|in that period they do not as yet belong to the domain of moral valuations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0693.mp3|is neither called good nor bad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0694.mp3|moral nor immoral|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0695.mp3|in the best period of the romans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0696.mp3|and should it be praised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0697.mp3|a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this praise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0698.mp3|even at the best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0699.mp3|directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0701.mp3|love to our neighbour is always a secondary matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0703.mp3|it is this fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral valuation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0704.mp3|certain strong and dangerous instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0707.mp3|revengefulness|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0711.mp3|which up till then had not only to be honoured from the point of view of general utility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0712.mp3|under other names of course than those here given|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0713.mp3|but had to be fostered and cultivated because they were perpetually required in the common danger against the common enemies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0715.mp3|when the outlets for them are lacking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0716.mp3|and are gradually branded as immoral and given over to calumny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0717.mp3|the contrary instincts and inclinations now attain to moral honour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0718.mp3|the gregarious instinct gradually draws its conclusions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0719.mp3|how much or how little dangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an opinion|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0724.mp3|that is now the moral perspective|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0725.mp3|here again fear is the mother of morals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0726.mp3|it is by the loftiest and strongest instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0727.mp3|when they break out passionately and carry the individual far above and beyond the average|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0728.mp3|and the low level of the gregarious conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0729.mp3|that the self reliance of the community is destroyed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0730.mp3|its belief in itself|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0734.mp3|consequently these very instincts will be most branded and defamed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0735.mp3|the lofty independent spirituality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0736.mp3|the will to stand alone|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0749.mp3|under very peaceful circumstances|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0770.mp3|draws its ultimate conclusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0771.mp3|if one could at all do away with danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0772.mp3|the cause of fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0773.mp3|one would have done away with this morality at the same time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0774.mp3|it would no longer be necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0775.mp3|it would not consider itself any longer necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0776.mp3|whoever examines the conscience of the present day european|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0777.mp3|will always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds and hidden recesses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0778.mp3|the imperative of the timidity of the herd we wish that some time or other there may be nothing more to fear some time or other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0780.mp3|let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0781.mp3|for people's ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0783.mp3|we know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one plainly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0784.mp3|and without metaphor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0785.mp3|counts man among the animals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0786.mp3|but it will be accounted to us almost a crime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0789.mp3|we cannot do otherwise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0790.mp3|for it is precisely here that our new insight is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0791.mp3|we have found that in all the principal moral judgments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0792.mp3|europe has become unanimous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0793.mp3|including likewise the countries where european influence prevails in europe people evidently know what socrates thought he did not know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0794.mp3|and what the famous serpent of old once promised to teach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0797.mp3|when we always insist that that which here thinks it knows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0798.mp3|that which here glorifies itself with praise and blame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0799.mp3|and calls itself good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0800.mp3|is the instinct of the herding human animal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0801.mp3|the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more to the front|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0802.mp3|to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0803.mp3|according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance of which it is the symptom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0805.mp3|as we understand the matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0806.mp3|only one kind of human morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0807.mp3|beside which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0808.mp3|before which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0809.mp3|and after which many other moralities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0810.mp3|and above all higher moralities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0811.mp3|are or should be possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0812.mp3|against such a possibility against such a should be however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0813.mp3|this morality defends itself with all its strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0815.mp3|with the help of a religion which has humoured and flattered the sublimest desires of the herding animal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0816.mp3|things have reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of this morality even in political and social arrangements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0817.mp3|the democratic movement is the inheritance of the christian movement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0818.mp3|that its tempo|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0819.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0820.mp3|is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0822.mp3|is indicated by the increasingly furious howling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0824.mp3|who are now roving through the highways of european culture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0828.mp3|at one in their tenacious opposition to every special claim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0829.mp3|every special right and privilege this means ultimately opposition to every right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0830.mp3|for when all are equal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0831.mp3|no one needs rights any longer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0832.mp3|at one in their distrust of punitive justice as though it were a violation of the weak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0834.mp3|but equally at one in their religion of sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0835.mp3|in their compassion for all that feels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0837.mp3|and suffers down to the very animals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0839.mp3|the extravagance of sympathy for god belongs to a democratic age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0840.mp3|altogether at one in the cry and impatience of their sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0841.mp3|in their deadly hatred of suffering generally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0842.mp3|in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or allowing it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0844.mp3|under the spell of which europe seems to be threatened with a new buddhism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0845.mp3|at one in their belief in the morality of mutual sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0846.mp3|as though it were morality in itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0847.mp3|the climax|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0848.mp3|the attained climax of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0849.mp3|the sole hope of the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0850.mp3|the consolation of the present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0851.mp3|the great discharge from all the obligations of the past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0852.mp3|altogether at one in their belief in the community as the deliverer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0854.mp3|and therefore in themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0855.mp3|we who hold a different belief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0860.mp3|a waning type of man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0861.mp3|as involving his mediocrising and depreciation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0862.mp3|where have we to fix our hopes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0863.mp3|in new philosophers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0864.mp3|there is no other alternative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0865.mp3|in minds strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0868.mp3|in men of the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0869.mp3|who in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which will compel millenniums to take new paths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0870.mp3|to teach man the future of humanity as his will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0871.mp3|as depending on human will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0872.mp3|and to make preparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in rearing and educating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0873.mp3|in order thereby to put an end to the frightful rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name of history the folly of the greatest number is only its last form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0875.mp3|at the very idea of which everything that has existed in the way of occult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0878.mp3|the image of such leaders hovers before our eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0879.mp3|is it lawful for me to say it aloud ye free spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0880.mp3|the conditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for their genesis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0881.mp3|the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a constraint to these tasks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0882.mp3|a transvaluation of values|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0883.mp3|under the new pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart transformed into brass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0884.mp3|so as to bear the weight of such responsibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0885.mp3|and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0886.mp3|the dreadful danger that they might be lacking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0888.mp3|these are our real anxieties and glooms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0891.mp3|these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the heaven of our life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0892.mp3|there are few pains so grievous as to have seen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0894.mp3|or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and deteriorated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0895.mp3|but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger of man himself deteriorating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0896.mp3|he who like us has recognized the extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in respect to the future of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0898.mp3|nor even a finger of god has participated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0900.mp3|suffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0901.mp3|he sees at a glance all that could still be made out of man through a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and arrangements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0902.mp3|he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction how unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0903.mp3|and how often in the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisions and new paths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0904.mp3|he knows still better from his painfulest recollections on what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank have hitherto usually gone to pieces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0905.mp3|broken down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0907.mp3|and become contemptible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0908.mp3|the universal degeneracy of mankind to the level of the man of the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0909.mp3|as idealized by the socialistic fools and shallow pates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0911.mp3|to a man of free society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0913.mp3|is undoubtedly possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0914.mp3|he who has thought out this possibility to its ultimate conclusion knows another loathing unknown to the rest of mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_05_nietzsche_0915.mp3|and perhaps also a new mission|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0002.mp3|i would venture to protest against an improper and injurious alteration of rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0003.mp3|which quite unnoticed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0004.mp3|and as if with the best conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0005.mp3|threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations of science and philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0006.mp3|i mean to say that one must have the right out of one's own experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0007.mp3|experience as it seems to me always implies unfortunate experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0008.mp3|to treat of such an important question of rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0009.mp3|so as not to speak of colour like the blind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0010.mp3|or against science like women and artists ah|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0012.mp3|it always finds things out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0013.mp3|the declaration of independence of the scientific man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0014.mp3|his emancipation from philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0015.mp3|is one of the subtler after effects of democratic organization and disorganization|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0016.mp3|the self glorification and self conceitedness of the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0017.mp3|and in its best springtime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0019.mp3|here also the instinct of the populace cries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0020.mp3|freedom from all masters and after science has|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0021.mp3|with the happiest results|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0022.mp3|resisted theology|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0024.mp3|it now proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0025.mp3|and in its turn to play the master|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0026.mp3|what am i saying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0027.mp3|to play the philosopher on its own account|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0028.mp3|my memory the memory of a scientific man if you please|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0030.mp3|the philologists and schoolmasters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0031.mp3|who are both the one and the other by profession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0033.mp3|at another time it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of otium and refined luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0034.mp3|and felt himself aggrieved and belittled thereby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0035.mp3|on another occasion it was the colour blindness of the utilitarian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0036.mp3|who sees nothing in philosophy but a series of refuted systems|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0037.mp3|and an extravagant expenditure which does nobody any good|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0067.mp3|which has injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the doors to the instinct of the populace|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0085.mp3|that is very evident|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0107.mp3|the dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0108.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0109.mp3|so manifold nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0110.mp3|that one might doubt whether this fruit could still come to maturity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0111.mp3|the extent and towering structure of the sciences have increased enormously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0112.mp3|and therewith also the probability that the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0113.mp3|or will attach himself somewhere and specialize so that he will no longer attain to his elevation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0115.mp3|to his superspection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0116.mp3|his circumspection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0117.mp3|and his despection or he gets aloft too late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0118.mp3|when the best of his maturity and strength is past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0119.mp3|or when he is impaired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0121.mp3|and deteriorated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0122.mp3|so that his view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0123.mp3|his general estimate of things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0124.mp3|is no longer of much importance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0125.mp3|it is perhaps just the refinement of his intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0127.mp3|a millepede|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0129.mp3|he knows too well that as a discerner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0130.mp3|one who has lost his self respect no longer commands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0131.mp3|no longer leads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0132.mp3|unless he should aspire to become a great play actor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0134.mp3|in short a misleader|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0135.mp3|this is in the last instance a question of taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0136.mp3|if it has not really been a question of conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0137.mp3|to double once more the philosopher's difficulties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0138.mp3|there is also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0140.mp3|not concerning science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0141.mp3|but concerning life and the worth of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0142.mp3|he learns unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain this verdict|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0143.mp3|and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief only through the most extensive perhaps disturbing and destroying experiences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0144.mp3|often hesitating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0146.mp3|and dumbfounded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0148.mp3|the philosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0149.mp3|either with the scientific man and ideal scholar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0150.mp3|or with the religiously elevated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0152.mp3|desecularized visionary and god intoxicated man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0153.mp3|and even yet when one hears anybody praised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0154.mp3|because he lives wisely or as a philosopher it hardly means anything more than prudently and apart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0156.mp3|that seems to the populace to be a kind of flight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0157.mp3|a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a bad game|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0162.mp3|in relation to the genius|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0163.mp3|that is to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0164.mp3|a being who either engenders or produces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0165.mp3|both words understood in their fullest sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0166.mp3|the man of learning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0167.mp3|the scientific average man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0168.mp3|has always something of the old maid about him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0171.mp3|he is not conversant with the two principal functions of man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0172.mp3|to both|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0174.mp3|to the scholar and to the old maid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0175.mp3|one concedes respectability|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0176.mp3|as if by way of indemnification|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0177.mp3|in these cases one emphasizes the respectability|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0178.mp3|and yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0179.mp3|in the compulsion of this concession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0180.mp3|one has the same admixture of vexation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0181.mp3|let us examine more closely what is the scientific man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0182.mp3|firstly a commonplace type of man with commonplace virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0185.mp3|non authoritative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0186.mp3|and non self sufficient type of man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0187.mp3|he possesses industry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0188.mp3|patient adaptableness to rank and file|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0190.mp3|he has the instinct for people like himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0191.mp3|and for that which they require|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0192.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0193.mp3|the portion of independence and green meadow without which there is no rest from labour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0194.mp3|the claim to honour and consideration which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0195.mp3|the sunshine of a good name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0196.mp3|the perpetual ratification of his value and usefulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0197.mp3|with which the inward distrust which lies at the bottom of the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0198.mp3|has again and again to be overcome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0199.mp3|the learned man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0200.mp3|as is appropriate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0201.mp3|has also maladies and faults of an ignoble kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0202.mp3|he is full of petty envy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0203.mp3|and has a lynx eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations he cannot attain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0204.mp3|he is confiding|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0205.mp3|yet only as one who lets himself go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0206.mp3|but does not flow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0207.mp3|and precisely before the man of the great current he stands all the colder and more reserved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0208.mp3|his eye is then like a smooth and irresponsive lake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0209.mp3|which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0210.mp3|the worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results from the instinct of mediocrity of his type|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0211.mp3|from the jesuitism of mediocrity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0212.mp3|which labours instinctively for the destruction of the exceptional man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0213.mp3|and endeavours to break|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0214.mp3|or still better to relax|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0215.mp3|every bent bow to relax|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0217.mp3|with consideration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0218.mp3|and naturally with an indulgent hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0219.mp3|to relax with confiding sympathy that is the real art of jesuitism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0220.mp3|which has always understood how to introduce itself as the religion of sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0221.mp3|however gratefully one may welcome the objective spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0225.mp3|one must learn caution even with regard to one's gratitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0227.mp3|as if it were the goal in itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0228.mp3|as if it were salvation and glorification|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0229.mp3|as is especially accustomed to happen in the pessimist school|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0231.mp3|who no longer curses and scolds like the pessimist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0232.mp3|the ideal man of learning in whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand complete and partial failures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0233.mp3|is assuredly one of the most costly instruments that exist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0234.mp3|but his place is in the hand of one who is more powerful he is only an instrument|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0236.mp3|he is a mirror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0237.mp3|he is no purpose in himself the objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed to prostration before everything that wants to be known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0239.mp3|he waits until something comes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0240.mp3|and then expands himself sensitively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0241.mp3|so that even the light footsteps and gliding past of spiritual beings may not be lost on his surface and film whatever personality he still possesses seems to him accidental|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0246.mp3|and not infrequently wrongly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0247.mp3|he readily confounds himself with other persons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0248.mp3|he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0249.mp3|and here only is he unrefined and negligent perhaps he is troubled about the health|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0250.mp3|or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0251.mp3|or the lack of companions and society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0253.mp3|his thoughts already rove away to the more general case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0255.mp3|not from lack of trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0256.mp3|but from lack of capacity for grasping and dealing with his trouble the habitual complaisance with respect to all objects and experiences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0257.mp3|the radiant and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that comes his way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0258.mp3|his habit of inconsiderate good nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0259.mp3|of dangerous indifference as to yea and nay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0261.mp3|there are enough of cases in which he has to atone for these virtues of his|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0262.mp3|and as man generally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0265.mp3|i mean love and hatred as god woman and animal understand them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0266.mp3|he will do what he can and furnish what he can|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0267.mp3|but one must not be surprised if it should not be much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0268.mp3|if he should show himself just at this point to be false|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0271.mp3|and deteriorated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0272.mp3|his love is constrained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0273.mp3|his hatred is artificial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0275.mp3|a slight ostentation and exaggeration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0276.mp3|he is only genuine so far as he can be objective|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0277.mp3|only in his serene totality is he still nature and natural|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0278.mp3|his mirroring and eternally self polishing soul no longer knows how to affirm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0279.mp3|no longer how to deny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0280.mp3|he does not command|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0281.mp3|neither does he destroy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0284.mp3|he does not go in advance of any one nor after either|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0285.mp3|he places himself generally too far off to have any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0286.mp3|if he has been so long confounded with the philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0288.mp3|he has had far too much honour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0290.mp3|he is an instrument|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0291.mp3|something of a slave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0292.mp3|though certainly the sublimest sort of slave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0293.mp3|but nothing in himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0294.mp3|the objective man is an instrument|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0296.mp3|easily injured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0297.mp3|easily tarnished measuring instrument and mirroring apparatus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0298.mp3|which is to be taken care of and respected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0299.mp3|but he is no goal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0302.mp3|no termination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0303.mp3|and still less a commencement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0304.mp3|an engendering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0305.mp3|or primary cause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0306.mp3|nothing hardy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0309.mp3|that wants to be master|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0312.mp3|delicate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0313.mp3|movable potter's form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0315.mp3|for the most part a man without frame and content a selfless man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0318.mp3|i hope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the objective spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0319.mp3|people all hear it impatiently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0320.mp3|they regard him on that account with some apprehension|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0322.mp3|many questions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0323.mp3|indeed among timid hearers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0324.mp3|of whom there are now so many|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0325.mp3|he is henceforth said to be dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0327.mp3|it seems to them as if they heard some evil threatening sound in the distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0328.mp3|as if a new kind of explosive were being tried somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0329.mp3|a dynamite of the spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0332.mp3|that not only denies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0333.mp3|means denial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0334.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0336.mp3|practises denial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0337.mp3|against this kind of good will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0338.mp3|a will to the veritable actual negation of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0339.mp3|there is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0340.mp3|as is generally acknowledged nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0341.mp3|no better soporific and sedative than skepticism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0342.mp3|the mild|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0345.mp3|and hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an antidote to the spirit and its underground noises|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0347.mp3|as lovers of repose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0348.mp3|and almost as a kind of safety police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0349.mp3|this subterranean nay is terrible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0353.mp3|that delicate creature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0354.mp3|is far too easily frightened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0357.mp3|decided yea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0358.mp3|and feels something like a bite thereby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0361.mp3|they seem to him opposed to morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0363.mp3|on the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0364.mp3|to make a festival to his virtue by a noble aloofness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0366.mp3|what do i know or with socrates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0367.mp3|i know that i know nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0368.mp3|or here i do not trust myself no door is open to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0370.mp3|even if the door were open why should i enter immediately or|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0371.mp3|what is the use of any hasty hypotheses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0373.mp3|are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is crooked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0374.mp3|to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0375.mp3|is there not time enough for that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0376.mp3|has not the time leisure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0378.mp3|the uncertain also has its charms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0384.mp3|was a philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0386.mp3|and in truth he needs some consolation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0387.mp3|for skepticism is the most spiritual expression of a certain many sided physiological temperament|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0391.mp3|in the new generation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0392.mp3|which has inherited as it were different standards and valuations in its blood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0393.mp3|everything is disquiet|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0404.mp3|which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0405.mp3|they are no longer familiar with independence of decision|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0406.mp3|or the courageous feeling of pleasure in willing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0407.mp3|they are doubtful of the freedom of the will even in their dreams our present day europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0408.mp3|the scene of a senseless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0409.mp3|precipitate attempt at a radical blending of classes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0410.mp3|and consequently of races|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0412.mp3|sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0413.mp3|sometimes with gloomy aspect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0415.mp3|and often sick unto death of its will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0416.mp3|paralysis of will where do we not find this cripple sitting nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0420.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0422.mp3|i am ready to answer for this diagnosis of the european disease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0423.mp3|the disease of the will is diffused unequally over europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0424.mp3|it is worst and most varied where civilization has longest prevailed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0425.mp3|it decreases according as the barbarian still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0426.mp3|or again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0427.mp3|asserts his claims under the loose drapery of western culture it is therefore in the france of today|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0428.mp3|as can be readily disclosed and comprehended|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0429.mp3|that the will is most infirm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0431.mp3|which has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the portentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0432.mp3|now manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0435.mp3|in a resolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0436.mp3|is already somewhat stronger in germany|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0437.mp3|and again in the north of germany it is stronger than in central germany|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0438.mp3|it is considerably stronger in england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0440.mp3|and corsica|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0442.mp3|not to mention italy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0443.mp3|which is too young yet to know what it wants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0444.mp3|and must first show whether it can exercise will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0445.mp3|but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense middle empire where europe as it were flows back to asia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0448.mp3|there the will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0449.mp3|uncertain whether to be negative or affirmative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0450.mp3|waits threateningly to be discharged to borrow their pet phrase from our physicists perhaps not only indian wars and complications in asia would be necessary to free europe from its greatest danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0451.mp3|but also internal subversion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0452.mp3|the shattering of the empire into small states|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0453.mp3|and above all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0455.mp3|in my heart i should rather prefer the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0456.mp3|i mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of russia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0457.mp3|that europe would have to make up its mind to become equally threatening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0459.mp3|by means of a new caste to rule over the continent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0461.mp3|dreadful will of its own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0462.mp3|that can set its aims thousands of years ahead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0463.mp3|so that the long spun out comedy of its petty statism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0465.mp3|might finally be brought to a close|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0466.mp3|the time for petty politics is past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0467.mp3|the next century will bring the struggle for the dominion of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0468.mp3|the compulsion to great politics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0470.mp3|i should like to express myself preliminarily merely by a parable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0471.mp3|which the lovers of german history will already understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0472.mp3|that unscrupulous enthusiast for big|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0473.mp3|handsome grenadiers who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0474.mp3|as king of prussia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0477.mp3|in reality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0478.mp3|the new and now triumphantly emerged type of german|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0479.mp3|the problematic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0481.mp3|had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0482.mp3|he knew what was then lacking in germany|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0483.mp3|the want of which was a hundred times more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0484.mp3|his ill will to the young frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound instinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0486.mp3|to his bitterest regret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0487.mp3|that his own son was not man enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0488.mp3|there however he deceived himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0489.mp3|but who would not have deceived himself in his place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0490.mp3|he saw his son lapsed to atheism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0491.mp3|to the esprit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0492.mp3|to the pleasant frivolity of clever frenchmen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0494.mp3|he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no longer hard enough either for evil or good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0495.mp3|and of a broken will that no longer commands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0496.mp3|is no longer able to command|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0499.mp3|there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous skepticism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0500.mp3|who knows to what extent it was encouraged just by his father's hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to solitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0501.mp3|the skepticism of daring manliness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0502.mp3|which is closely related to the genius for war and conquest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0503.mp3|and made its first entrance into germany in the person of the great frederick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0504.mp3|this skepticism despises and nevertheless grasps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0505.mp3|it undermines and takes possession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0506.mp3|it does not believe but it does not thereby lose itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0507.mp3|it gives the spirit a dangerous liberty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0508.mp3|but it keeps strict guard over the heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0509.mp3|it is the german form of skepticism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0511.mp3|as a continued fredericianism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0513.mp3|has kept europe for a considerable time under the dominion of the german spirit and its critical and historical distrust owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character of the great german philologists and historical critics who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0514.mp3|rightly estimated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0515.mp3|were also all of them artists of destruction and dissolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0516.mp3|a new conception of the german spirit gradually established itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0517.mp3|in spite of all romanticism in music and philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0518.mp3|in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was decidedly prominent whether|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0520.mp3|as fearlessness of gaze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0521.mp3|as courage and sternness of the dissecting hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0524.mp3|there may be good grounds for it when warm blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before this spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0526.mp3|not without a shudder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0527.mp3|but if one would realize how characteristic is this fear of the man in the german spirit which awakened europe out of its dogmatic slumber let us call to mind the former conception which had to be overcome by this new one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0528.mp3|and that it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0529.mp3|with unbridled presumption|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0530.mp3|to recommend the germans to the interest of europe as gentle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0531.mp3|good hearted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0533.mp3|and poetical fools|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0534.mp3|finally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0536.mp3|that was as much as to say but this is a man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0540.mp3|that in the picture of the philosophers of the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0542.mp3|something in them would only be designated thereby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0543.mp3|and not they themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0544.mp3|with equal right they might call themselves critics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0545.mp3|and assuredly they will be men of experiments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0546.mp3|by the name with which i ventured to baptize them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0548.mp3|as critics in body and soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0550.mp3|and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0551.mp3|in their passion for knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0552.mp3|will they have to go further in daring and painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic century can approve of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0554.mp3|the conscious employment of a unity of method|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0555.mp3|the wary courage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0557.mp3|and the capacity for self responsibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0559.mp3|they will avow among themselves a delight in denial and dissection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0560.mp3|and a certain considerate cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0561.mp3|which knows how to handle the knife surely and deftly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0563.mp3|they will not deal with the truth in order that it may please them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0564.mp3|or elevate and inspire them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0565.mp3|they will rather have little faith in truth bringing with it such revels for the feelings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0566.mp3|they will smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0567.mp3|those rigorous spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0568.mp3|when any one says in their presence that thought elevates me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0569.mp3|why should it not be true or that work enchants me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0570.mp3|why should it not be beautiful or that artist enlarges me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0571.mp3|why should he not be great perhaps they will not only have a smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0573.mp3|idealistic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0578.mp3|critical discipline|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0579.mp3|and every habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0580.mp3|will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers of the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0581.mp3|they may even make a display thereof as their special adornment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0582.mp3|nevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that account|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0583.mp3|it will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to have it decreed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0584.mp3|as is so welcome nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0585.mp3|that philosophy itself is criticism and critical science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0587.mp3|let us call to mind the titles of his principal works|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0588.mp3|our new philosophers will say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0589.mp3|notwithstanding|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0590.mp3|that critics are instruments of the philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0591.mp3|and just on that account|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0592.mp3|as instruments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0593.mp3|they are far from being philosophers themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0595.mp3|i insist upon it that people finally cease confounding philosophical workers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0596.mp3|and in general scientific men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0597.mp3|with philosophers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0598.mp3|that precisely here one should strictly give each his own and not give those far too much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0599.mp3|these far too little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0600.mp3|it may be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself should have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0601.mp3|the scientific workers of philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0602.mp3|remain standing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0603.mp3|and must remain standing he himself must perhaps have been critic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0605.mp3|and historian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0606.mp3|and besides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0608.mp3|and collector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0609.mp3|and traveler|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0613.mp3|and free spirit and almost everything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0614.mp3|in order to traverse the whole range of human values and estimations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0615.mp3|and that he may be able with a variety of eyes and consciences to look from a height to any distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0616.mp3|from a depth up to any height|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0617.mp3|from a nook into any expanse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0618.mp3|but all these are only preliminary conditions for his task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0619.mp3|this task itself demands something else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0620.mp3|it requires him to create values the philosophical workers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0621.mp3|after the excellent pattern of kant and hegel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0622.mp3|have to fix and formalize some great existing body of valuations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0623.mp3|that is to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0624.mp3|former determinations of value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0625.mp3|creations of value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0626.mp3|which have become prevalent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0627.mp3|and are for a time called truths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0628.mp3|whether in the domain of the logical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0629.mp3|the political moral|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0630.mp3|or the artistic it is for these investigators to make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0632.mp3|conceivable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0634.mp3|and manageable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0635.mp3|to shorten everything long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0636.mp3|even time itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0637.mp3|and to subjugate the entire past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0638.mp3|an immense and wonderful task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0639.mp3|in the carrying out of which all refined pride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0640.mp3|all tenacious will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0641.mp3|can surely find satisfaction|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0645.mp3|and all subjugators of the past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0646.mp3|they grasp at the future with a creative hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0647.mp3|and whatever is and was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0648.mp3|becomes for them thereby a means|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0649.mp3|an instrument|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0650.mp3|and a hammer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0651.mp3|their knowing is creating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0652.mp3|their creating is a law giving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0653.mp3|their will to truth is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0654.mp3|are there at present such philosophers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0656.mp3|must there not be such philosophers some day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0657.mp3|it is always more obvious to me that the philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0658.mp3|as a man indispensable for the morrow and the day after the morrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0659.mp3|has ever found himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0660.mp3|and has been obliged to find himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0661.mp3|in contradiction to the day in which he lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0662.mp3|his enemy has always been the ideal of his day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0663.mp3|hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one calls philosophers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0664.mp3|who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0665.mp3|but rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0666.mp3|have found their mission|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0668.mp3|involuntary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0669.mp3|imperative mission in the end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0671.mp3|the greatness of their mission|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0672.mp3|in being the bad conscience of their age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0673.mp3|in putting the vivisector's knife to the breast of the very virtues of their age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0674.mp3|they have betrayed their own secret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0675.mp3|it has been for the sake of a new greatness of man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0677.mp3|they have always disclosed how much hypocrisy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0679.mp3|self indulgence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0681.mp3|how much falsehood was concealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0682.mp3|how much virtue was outlived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0685.mp3|if there could be philosophers nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0686.mp3|would be compelled to place the greatness of man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0687.mp3|the conception of greatness precisely in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0688.mp3|in his all roundness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0689.mp3|he would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety of that which a man could bear and take upon himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0690.mp3|according to the extent to which a man could stretch his responsibility nowadays the taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0691.mp3|nothing is so adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0692.mp3|in the ideal of the philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0695.mp3|and capacity for prolonged resolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0696.mp3|must specially be included in the conception of greatness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0697.mp3|with as good a right as the opposite doctrine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0698.mp3|with its ideal of a silly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0701.mp3|selfless humanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0702.mp3|was suited to an opposite age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0703.mp3|such as the sixteenth century|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0704.mp3|which suffered from its accumulated energy of will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0705.mp3|and from the wildest torrents and floods of selfishness in the time of socrates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0706.mp3|among men only of worn out instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0707.mp3|old conservative athenians who let themselves go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0708.mp3|for the sake of happiness as they said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0709.mp3|for the sake of pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0710.mp3|as their conduct indicated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0711.mp3|and who had continually on their lips the old pompous words to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0712.mp3|irony was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0713.mp3|the wicked socratic assurance of the old physician and plebeian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0714.mp3|who cut ruthlessly into his own flesh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0715.mp3|as into the flesh and heart of the noble with a look that said plainly enough do not dissemble before me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0717.mp3|we are equal at present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0718.mp3|on the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0719.mp3|when throughout europe the herding animal alone attains to honours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0721.mp3|when equality of right can too readily be transformed into equality in wrong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0722.mp3|i mean to say into general war against everything rare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0724.mp3|and privileged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0725.mp3|against the higher man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0726.mp3|the higher soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0727.mp3|the higher duty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0728.mp3|the higher responsibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0730.mp3|at present it belongs to the conception of greatness to be noble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0732.mp3|to be capable of being different|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0733.mp3|to stand alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0734.mp3|to have to live by personal initiative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0735.mp3|and the philosopher will betray something of his own ideal when he asserts he shall be the greatest who can be the most solitary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0736.mp3|the most concealed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0737.mp3|the most divergent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0738.mp3|the man beyond good and evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0739.mp3|the master of his virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0741.mp3|precisely this shall be called greatness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0742.mp3|as diversified as can be entire as ample as can be full|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0743.mp3|and to ask once more the question is greatness possible nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0745.mp3|because it cannot be taught|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0746.mp3|one must know it by experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0747.mp3|or one should have the pride not to know it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0748.mp3|the fact that at present people all talk of things of which they cannot have any experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0749.mp3|is true more especially and unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical matters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0750.mp3|the very few know them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0751.mp3|are permitted to know them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0752.mp3|and all popular ideas about them are false|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0754.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0755.mp3|the truly philosophical combination of a bold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0756.mp3|exuberant spirituality which runs at presto pace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0757.mp3|and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no false step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0758.mp3|is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0759.mp3|and therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0760.mp3|should any one speak of it in their presence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0761.mp3|it is incredible to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0762.mp3|they conceive of every necessity as troublesome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0763.mp3|as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0764.mp3|thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0765.mp3|almost as a trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0766.mp3|and often enough as worthy of the sweat of the noble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0767.mp3|but not at all as something easy and divine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0768.mp3|closely related to dancing and exuberance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0769.mp3|to think and to take a matter seriously arduously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0770.mp3|that is one and the same thing to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0771.mp3|such only has been their experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0772.mp3|artists have here perhaps a finer intuition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0773.mp3|they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything arbitrarily and everything of necessity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0775.mp3|of subtlety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0776.mp3|of power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0777.mp3|of creatively fixing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0779.mp3|and shaping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0780.mp3|reaches its climax|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0782.mp3|that necessity and freedom of will are then the same thing with them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0785.mp3|a gradation of rank in psychical states|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0786.mp3|to which the gradation of rank in the problems corresponds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0787.mp3|and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0788.mp3|without being predestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his spirituality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0789.mp3|of what use is it for nimble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0790.mp3|everyday intellects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0793.mp3|in their plebeian ambition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0794.mp3|close to such problems|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0795.mp3|and as it were into this holy of holies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0796.mp3|as so often happens nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0797.mp3|but coarse feet must never tread upon such carpets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0798.mp3|this is provided for in the primary law of things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0799.mp3|the doors remain closed to those intruders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0800.mp3|though they may dash and break their heads thereon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0803.mp3|more definitely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0804.mp3|they have to be bred for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0805.mp3|a person has only a right to philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0806.mp3|taking the word in its higher significance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0807.mp3|in virtue of his descent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0809.mp3|many generations must have prepared the way for the coming of the philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0810.mp3|each of his virtues must have been separately acquired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0813.mp3|and embodied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0814.mp3|not only the bold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0816.mp3|delicate course and current of his thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0817.mp3|but above all the readiness for great responsibilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0818.mp3|the majesty of ruling glance and contemning look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0819.mp3|the feeling of separation from the multitude with their duties and virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0821.mp3|be it god or devil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0822.mp3|the delight and practice of supreme justice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_06_nietzsche_0823.mp3|the art of commanding|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0001.mp3|it is probable that we|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0003.mp3|have still our virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0005.mp3|we europeans of the day after tomorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0007.mp3|with all our dangerous curiosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0009.mp3|our mellow and seemingly sweetened cruelty in sense and spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0010.mp3|we shall presumably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0013.mp3|with our most ardent requirements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0014.mp3|well then let us look for them in our labyrinths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0016.mp3|as we know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0017.mp3|so many things lose themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0018.mp3|so many things get quite lost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0020.mp3|is it not almost to believe in one's own virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0021.mp3|but this believing in one's own virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0023.mp3|respectable pigtail of an idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0024.mp3|which our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0025.mp3|and often enough also behind their understandings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0026.mp3|it seems|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0027.mp3|therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0028.mp3|that however little we may imagine ourselves to be old fashioned and grandfatherly respectable in other respects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0029.mp3|in one thing we are nevertheless the worthy grandchildren of our grandfathers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0030.mp3|we last europeans with good consciences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0031.mp3|we also still wear their pigtail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0033.mp3|if you only knew how soon so very soon it will be different|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0036.mp3|now with red light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0037.mp3|now with green|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0039.mp3|so we modern men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0040.mp3|owing to the complicated mechanism of our firmament are determined by different moralities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0041.mp3|our actions shine alternately in different colours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0042.mp3|and are seldom unequivocal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0043.mp3|and there are often cases|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0045.mp3|in which our actions are motley coloured two hundred sixteen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0046.mp3|to love one's enemies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0047.mp3|i think that has been well learnt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0048.mp3|it takes place thousands of times at present on a large and small scale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0049.mp3|indeed at times the higher and sublimer thing takes place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0050.mp3|we learn to despise when we love and precisely when we love best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0053.mp3|unconsciously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0054.mp3|without noise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0055.mp3|without ostentation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0056.mp3|with the shame and secrecy of goodness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0057.mp3|which forbids the utterance of the pompous word and the formula of virtue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0059.mp3|this is also an advance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0062.mp3|it is the music in our conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0063.mp3|the dance in our spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0064.mp3|to which puritan litanies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0066.mp3|and goody goodness won't chime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0068.mp3|they never forgive us if they have once made a mistake before us or even with regard to us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0069.mp3|they inevitably become our instinctive calumniators and detractors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0070.mp3|even when they still remain our friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0072.mp3|for they get the better even of their blunders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0073.mp3|the psychologists of france|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0074.mp3|and where else are there still psychologists nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0077.mp3|in short they betray something thereby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0079.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0083.mp3|nor tasted anything else in the end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0084.mp3|it was his mode of self torment and refined cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0085.mp3|as this is growing wearisome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0090.mp3|honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks they have to perform|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0093.mp3|jesuitical astuteness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0094.mp3|which is a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the middle class in its best moments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0095.mp3|subtler even than the understanding of its victims|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0096.mp3|a repeated proof that instinct is the most intelligent of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0098.mp3|you psychologists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0099.mp3|study the philosophy of the rule in its struggle with the exception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0100.mp3|there you have a spectacle fit for gods and godlike malignity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0102.mp3|in plainer words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0104.mp3|the practice of judging and condemning morally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0108.mp3|it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and becoming subtle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0110.mp3|they are glad in their inmost heart that there is a standard according to which those who are over endowed with intellectual goods and privileges|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0111.mp3|are equal to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0112.mp3|they contend for the equality of all before god and almost need the belief in god for this purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0113.mp3|it is among them that the most powerful antagonists of atheism are found|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0114.mp3|if any one were to say to them a lofty spirituality is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely moral man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0116.mp3|i would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality itself exists only as the ultimate product of moral qualities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0117.mp3|that it is a synthesis of all qualities attributed to the merely moral man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0118.mp3|after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0119.mp3|perhaps during a whole series of generations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0121.mp3|and the beneficent severity which knows that it is authorized to maintain gradations of rank in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0122.mp3|even among things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0123.mp3|and not only among men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0124.mp3|now that the praise of the disinterested person is so popular one must|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0125.mp3|probably not without some danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0126.mp3|get an idea of what people actually take an interest in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0127.mp3|and what are the things generally which fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0128.mp3|including the cultured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0129.mp3|even the learned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0130.mp3|and perhaps philosophers also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0131.mp3|if appearances do not deceive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0132.mp3|the fact thereby becomes obvious that the greater part of what interests and charms higher natures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0133.mp3|and more refined and fastidious tastes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0134.mp3|seems absolutely uninteresting to the average man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0136.mp3|notwithstanding|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0139.mp3|and wonders how it is possible to act disinterestedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0140.mp3|there have been philosophers who could give this popular astonishment a seductive and mystical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0142.mp3|instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that disinterested action is very interesting and interested action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0143.mp3|provided that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0144.mp3|and love what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0145.mp3|even an action for love's sake shall be unegoistic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0147.mp3|and the praise of the self sacrificer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0148.mp3|but whoever has really offered sacrifice knows that he wanted and obtained something for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0150.mp3|that he relinquished here in order to have more there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0151.mp3|perhaps in general to be more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0152.mp3|or even feel himself more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0153.mp3|but this is a realm of questions and answers in which a more fastidious spirit does not like to stay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0154.mp3|for here truth has to stifle her yawns so much when she is obliged to answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0155.mp3|and after all truth is a woman one must not use force with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0157.mp3|that i honour and respect an unselfish man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0161.mp3|but because i think he has a right to be useful to another man at his own expense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0162.mp3|in short the question is always who he is and who the other is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0164.mp3|in a person created and destined for command|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0165.mp3|self denial and modest retirement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0166.mp3|instead of being virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0167.mp3|would be the waste of virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0168.mp3|so it seems to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0169.mp3|every system of unegoistic morality which takes itself unconditionally and appeals to every one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0170.mp3|not only sins against good taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0171.mp3|but is also an incentive to sins of omission|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0172.mp3|an additional seduction under the mask of philanthropy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0173.mp3|and precisely a seduction and injury to the higher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0175.mp3|and more privileged types of men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0176.mp3|moral systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the gradations of rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0177.mp3|their presumption must be driven home to their conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0182.mp3|a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0183.mp3|wherever sympathy fellow suffering is preached nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0184.mp3|and if i gather rightly no other religion is any longer preached|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0185.mp3|let the psychologist have his ears open through all the vanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0186.mp3|through all the noise which is natural to these preachers as to all preachers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0189.mp3|genuine note of self contempt it belongs to the overshadowing and uglifying of europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0192.mp3|is excessively dissatisfied with himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0193.mp3|this is perfectly certain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0194.mp3|he suffers and his vanity wants him only to suffer with his fellows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0196.mp3|a tolerably ugly plebeian taken all in all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0197.mp3|absolutely requires a costume|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0198.mp3|he needs history as a storeroom of costumes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0199.mp3|to be sure he notices that none of the costumes fit him properly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0201.mp3|let us look at the nineteenth century with respect to these hasty preferences and changes in its masquerades of style|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0202.mp3|and also with respect to its moments of desperation on account of nothing suiting us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0203.mp3|it is in vain to get ourselves up as romantic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0204.mp3|or classical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0206.mp3|or florentine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0209.mp3|it does not clothe us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0210.mp3|but the spirit especially the historical spirit profits even by this desperation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0212.mp3|put on|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0220.mp3|we are prepared as no other age has ever been for a carnival in the grand style|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0222.mp3|laughter and arrogance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0223.mp3|for the transcendental height of supreme folly and aristophanic ridicule of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0224.mp3|perhaps we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0227.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0228.mp3|though nothing else of the present have a future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0230.mp3|the historical sense or the capacity for divining quickly the order of rank of the valuations according to which a people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0232.mp3|or an individual has lived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0233.mp3|the divining instinct for the relationships of these valuations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0234.mp3|for the relation of the authority of the valuations to the authority of the operating forces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0235.mp3|this historical sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0237.mp3|has come to us in the train of the enchanting and mad semi barbarity into which europe has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes and races|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0238.mp3|it is only the nineteenth century that has recognized this faculty as its sixth sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0239.mp3|owing to this mingling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0240.mp3|the past of every form and mode of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0241.mp3|and of cultures which were formerly closely contiguous and superimposed on one another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0242.mp3|flows forth into us modern souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0243.mp3|our instincts now run back in all directions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0244.mp3|we ourselves are a kind of chaos|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0246.mp3|as we have said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0247.mp3|the spirit perceives its advantage therein|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0248.mp3|by means of our semi barbarity in body and in desire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0249.mp3|we have secret access everywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0250.mp3|such as a noble age never had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0251.mp3|we have access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0252.mp3|and to every form of semi barbarity that has at any time existed on earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0253.mp3|and in so far as the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto has just been semi barbarity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0254.mp3|the historical sense implies almost the sense and instinct for everything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0255.mp3|the taste and tongue for everything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0256.mp3|whereby it immediately proves itself to be an ignoble sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0257.mp3|for instance we enjoy homer once more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0258.mp3|it is perhaps our happiest acquisition that we know how to appreciate homer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0259.mp3|whom men of distinguished culture as the french of the seventeenth century|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0263.mp3|the last echo of the century cannot and could not so easily appropriate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0264.mp3|whom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0265.mp3|the very decided yea and nay of their palate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0266.mp3|their promptly ready disgust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0268.mp3|their horror of the bad taste even of lively curiosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0269.mp3|and in general the averseness of every distinguished and self sufficing culture to avow a new desire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0270.mp3|a dissatisfaction with its own condition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0271.mp3|or an admiration of what is strange|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0273.mp3|and no faculty is more unintelligible to such men than just this historical sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0274.mp3|with its truckling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0276.mp3|the case is not different with shakespeare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0277.mp3|that marvelous spanish moorish saxon synthesis of taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0279.mp3|but we|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0281.mp3|this medley of the most delicate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0282.mp3|the most coarse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0283.mp3|and the most artificial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0284.mp3|with a secret confidence and cordiality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0285.mp3|we enjoy it as a refinement of art reserved expressly for us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0286.mp3|and allow ourselves to be as little disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the english populace in which shakespeare's art and taste lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0288.mp3|where|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0289.mp3|with all our senses awake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0290.mp3|we go our way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0293.mp3|that as men of the historical sense we have our virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0294.mp3|is not to be disputed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0295.mp3|we are unpretentious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0296.mp3|unselfish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0297.mp3|modest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0299.mp3|habituated to self control and self renunciation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0300.mp3|very grateful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0301.mp3|very patient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0303.mp3|but with all this we are perhaps not very tasteful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0304.mp3|let us finally confess it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0305.mp3|that what is most difficult for us men of the historical sense to grasp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0309.mp3|what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and almost hostile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0310.mp3|is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every culture and art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0311.mp3|the essentially noble in works and men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0312.mp3|their moment of smooth sea and halcyon self sufficiency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0313.mp3|the goldenness and coldness which all things show that have perfected themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0314.mp3|perhaps our great virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to good taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0316.mp3|and we can only evoke in ourselves imperfectly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0317.mp3|hesitatingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0318.mp3|and with compulsion the small|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0320.mp3|and happy godsends and glorifications of human life as they shine here and there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0323.mp3|by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still trembling ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0324.mp3|proportionateness is strange to us let us confess it to ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0325.mp3|our itching is really the itching for the infinite the immeasurable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0326.mp3|like the rider on his forward panting horse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0328.mp3|we modern men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0329.mp3|we semi barbarians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0332.mp3|pessimism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0333.mp3|utilitarianism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0335.mp3|all those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things according to pleasure and pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0337.mp3|according to accompanying circumstances and secondary considerations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0339.mp3|which every one conscious of creative powers and an artist's conscience will look down upon with scorn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0340.mp3|though not without sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0342.mp3|to be sure that is not sympathy as you understand it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0343.mp3|it is not sympathy for social distress for society with its sick and misfortuned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0344.mp3|for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie on the ground around us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0347.mp3|revolutionary slave classes who strive after power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0348.mp3|they call it freedom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0349.mp3|our sympathy is a loftier and further sighted sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0350.mp3|we see how man dwarfs himself how you dwarf him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0351.mp3|and there are moments when we view your sympathy with an indescribable anguish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0352.mp3|when we resist it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0353.mp3|when we regard your seriousness as more dangerous than any kind of levity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0355.mp3|and there is not a more foolish if possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0356.mp3|and we|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0357.mp3|it really seems that we would rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0358.mp3|well being as you understand it is certainly not a goal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0359.mp3|it seems to us an end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0360.mp3|a condition which at once renders man ludicrous and contemptible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0361.mp3|and makes his destruction desirable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0362.mp3|the discipline of suffering of great suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0363.mp3|know ye not that it is only this discipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hitherto|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0365.mp3|its shuddering in view of rack and ruin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0366.mp3|its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0369.mp3|and exploiting misfortune|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0370.mp3|and whatever depth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0375.mp3|or greatness has been bestowed upon the soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0376.mp3|has it not been bestowed through suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0377.mp3|through the discipline of great suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0378.mp3|in man creature and creator are united|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0379.mp3|in man there is not only matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0384.mp3|folly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0386.mp3|but there is also the creator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0387.mp3|the sculptor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0388.mp3|the hardness of the hammer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0389.mp3|the divinity of the spectator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0390.mp3|and the seventh day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0391.mp3|do ye understand this contrast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0392.mp3|and that your sympathy for the creature in man applies to that which has to be fashioned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0399.mp3|to that which must necessarily suffer and is meant to suffer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0400.mp3|and our sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0401.mp3|do ye not understand what our reverse sympathy applies to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0403.mp3|so it is sympathy against sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0404.mp3|but to repeat it once more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0405.mp3|there are higher problems than the problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0407.mp3|this world with which we are concerned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0408.mp3|in which we have to fear and love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0409.mp3|this almost invisible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0410.mp3|inaudible world of delicate command and delicate obedience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0411.mp3|a world of almost in every respect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0413.mp3|insidious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0415.mp3|and tender|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0417.mp3|it is well protected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0418.mp3|we are woven into a strong net and garment of duties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0419.mp3|and cannot disengage ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0420.mp3|precisely here we are men of duty even we|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0423.mp3|we dance in our chains and betwixt our swords|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0424.mp3|it is none the less true that more often we gnash our teeth under the circumstances|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0429.mp3|honesty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0431.mp3|we free spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0433.mp3|we will labour at it with all our perversity and love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0434.mp3|and not tire of perfecting ourselves in our virtue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0435.mp3|which alone remains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0436.mp3|may its glance some day overspread like a gilded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0438.mp3|mocking twilight this aging civilization with its dull gloomy seriousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0439.mp3|and if|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0443.mp3|and stretch its limbs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0444.mp3|and find us too hard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0445.mp3|and would fain have it pleasanter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0448.mp3|like an agreeable vice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0449.mp3|let us remain hard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0450.mp3|we latest stoics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0451.mp3|and let us send to its help whatever devilry we have in us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0454.mp3|our sharpened and fastidious curiosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0457.mp3|intellectual will to power and universal conquest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0458.mp3|which rambles and roves avidiously around all the realms of the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0459.mp3|let us go with all our devils to the help of our god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0460.mp3|it is probable that people will misunderstand and mistake us on that account|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0461.mp3|what does it matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0463.mp3|that is their devilry and nothing else what does it matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0464.mp3|and even if they were right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0465.mp3|have not all gods hitherto been such sanctified re baptized devils|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0466.mp3|and after all what do we know of ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0467.mp3|and what the spirit that leads us wants to be called|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0468.mp3|it is a question of names|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0470.mp3|our honesty we free spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0471.mp3|let us be careful lest it become our vanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0472.mp3|our ornament and ostentation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0474.mp3|our stupidity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0475.mp3|every virtue inclines to stupidity every stupidity to virtue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0476.mp3|stupid to the point of sanctity they say in russia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0478.mp3|is not life a hundred times too short for us to bore ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0480.mp3|i hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophy hitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporific appliances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0481.mp3|and that virtue in my opinion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0482.mp3|has been more injured by the tediousness of its advocates than by anything else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0483.mp3|at the same time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0485.mp3|i would not wish to overlook their general usefulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0486.mp3|it is desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon morals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0487.mp3|and consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some day become interesting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0488.mp3|but let us not be afraid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0489.mp3|things still remain today as they have always been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0490.mp3|i see no one in europe who has or discloses an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might be conducted in a dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0493.mp3|that calamity might be involved therein|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0495.mp3|for example|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0496.mp3|the indefatigable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0497.mp3|inevitable english utilitarians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0498.mp3|how ponderously and respectably they stalk on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0499.mp3|stalk along a homeric metaphor expresses it better in the footsteps of bentham|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0505.mp3|no new thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0508.mp3|an impossible literature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0509.mp3|taking it all in all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0514.mp3|has insinuated itself also into these moralists whom one must certainly read with an eye to their motives if one must read them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0515.mp3|concealed this time under the new form of the scientific spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0517.mp3|there is not absent from them a secret struggle with the pangs of conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0518.mp3|from which a race of former puritans must naturally suffer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0519.mp3|in all their scientific tinkering with morals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0520.mp3|is not a moralist the opposite of a puritan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0521.mp3|that is to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0522.mp3|as a thinker who regards morality as questionable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0523.mp3|as worthy of interrogation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0525.mp3|as a problem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0526.mp3|is moralizing not immoral in the end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0528.mp3|inasmuch as mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0529.mp3|or the general utility or the happiness of the greatest number|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0531.mp3|the happiness of england will be best served thereby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0533.mp3|by all means|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0534.mp3|to convince themselves that the striving after english happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0535.mp3|i mean after comfort and fashion and in the highest instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0536.mp3|a seat in parliament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0537.mp3|is at the same time the true path of virtue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0538.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0539.mp3|that in so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0540.mp3|it has just consisted in such striving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0541.mp3|not one of those ponderous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0542.mp3|conscience stricken herding animals who undertake to advocate the cause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare wants to have any knowledge or inkling of the facts that the general welfare is no ideal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0544.mp3|no notion that can be at all grasped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0545.mp3|but is only a nostrum|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0546.mp3|that what is fair to one may not at all be fair to another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0549.mp3|that there is a distinction of rank between man and man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0550.mp3|and consequently between morality and morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0551.mp3|they are an unassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0552.mp3|these utilitarian englishmen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0554.mp3|as already remarked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0555.mp3|in so far as they are tedious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0556.mp3|one cannot think highly enough of their utility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0557.mp3|one ought even to encourage them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0558.mp3|as has been partially attempted in the following rhymes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0561.mp3|unenraptured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0562.mp3|never jesting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0563.mp3|mediocre everlasting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0565.mp3|which may be proud of their humanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0566.mp3|there still remains so much fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0567.mp3|so much superstition of the fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0568.mp3|of the cruel wild beast the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of these humaner ages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0569.mp3|that even obvious truths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0570.mp3|as if by the agreement of centuries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0571.mp3|have long remained unuttered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0572.mp3|because they have the appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0573.mp3|i perhaps risk something when i allow such a truth to escape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0574.mp3|let others capture it again and give it so much milk of pious sentiment to drink|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0576.mp3|in its old corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0577.mp3|one ought to learn anew about cruelty and open one's eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0578.mp3|one ought at last to learn impatience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0579.mp3|in order that such immodest gross errors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0583.mp3|may no longer wander about virtuously and boldly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0585.mp3|this is my thesis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0586.mp3|the wild beast has not been slain at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0588.mp3|it flourishes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0589.mp3|it has only been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0590.mp3|transfigured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0591.mp3|that which constitutes the painful delight of tragedy is cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0592.mp3|that which operates agreeably in so called tragic sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0593.mp3|and at the basis even of everything sublime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0594.mp3|up to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0595.mp3|obtains its sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0596.mp3|what the roman enjoys in the arena|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0597.mp3|the christian in the ecstasies of the cross|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0599.mp3|or of the bull fight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0600.mp3|the present day japanese who presses his way to the tragedy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0603.mp3|with unhinged will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0605.mp3|what all these enjoy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0606.mp3|and strive with mysterious ardour to drink in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0609.mp3|to be sure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0610.mp3|we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of former times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0611.mp3|which could only teach with regard to cruelty that it originated at the sight of the suffering of others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0614.mp3|in causing one's own suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0615.mp3|and wherever man has allowed himself to be persuaded to self denial in the religious sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0618.mp3|or in general|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0621.mp3|and contrition|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0625.mp3|by the dangerous thrill of cruelty towards himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0626.mp3|finally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0627.mp3|let us consider that even the seeker of knowledge operates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0628.mp3|in that he compels his spirit to perceive against its own inclination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0629.mp3|and often enough against the wishes of his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0630.mp3|he forces it to say nay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0631.mp3|where he would like to affirm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0634.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0635.mp3|every instance of taking a thing profoundly and fundamentally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0636.mp3|is a violation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0637.mp3|an intentional injuring of the fundamental will of the spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0638.mp3|which instinctively aims at appearance and superficiality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0639.mp3|even in every desire for knowledge there is a drop of cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0641.mp3|i may be allowed a word of explanation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0642.mp3|that imperious something which is popularly called the spirit wishes to be master internally and externally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0643.mp3|and to feel itself master|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0644.mp3|it has the will of a multiplicity for a simplicity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0646.mp3|taming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0648.mp3|and essentially ruling will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0649.mp3|its requirements and capacities here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0650.mp3|are the same as those assigned by physiologists to everything that lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0652.mp3|and multiplies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0653.mp3|the power of the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong tendency to assimilate the new to the old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0654.mp3|to simplify the manifold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0655.mp3|to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0657.mp3|makes prominent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0658.mp3|and falsifies for itself certain traits and lines in the foreign elements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0659.mp3|in every portion of the outside world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0660.mp3|its object thereby is the incorporation of new experiences the assortment of new things in the old arrangements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0661.mp3|in short growth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0662.mp3|or more properly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0663.mp3|the feeling of growth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0664.mp3|the feeling of increased power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0665.mp3|is its object|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0666.mp3|this same will has at its service an apparently opposed impulse of the spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0667.mp3|a suddenly adopted preference of ignorance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0668.mp3|of arbitrary shutting out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0669.mp3|a closing of windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0670.mp3|an inner denial of this or that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0671.mp3|a prohibition to approach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0672.mp3|a sort of defensive attitude against much that is knowable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0673.mp3|a contentment with obscurity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0674.mp3|with the shutting in horizon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0675.mp3|an acceptance and approval of ignorance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0676.mp3|as that which is all necessary according to the degree of its appropriating power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0677.mp3|its digestive power to speak figuratively and in fact the spirit resembles a stomach more than anything else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0678.mp3|here also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be deceived perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is not so and so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0679.mp3|but is only allowed to pass as such|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0680.mp3|a delight in uncertainty and ambiguity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0681.mp3|an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0682.mp3|out of the way narrowness and mystery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0684.mp3|of the foreground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0685.mp3|of the magnified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0686.mp3|the diminished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0687.mp3|the misshapen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0688.mp3|the beautified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0689.mp3|an enjoyment of the arbitrariness of all these manifestations of power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0691.mp3|in this connection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0692.mp3|there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to deceive other spirits and dissemble before them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0693.mp3|the constant pressing and straining of a creating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0695.mp3|changeable power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0696.mp3|the spirit enjoys therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0697.mp3|it enjoys also its feeling of security therein|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0698.mp3|it is precisely by its protean arts that it is best protected and concealed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0699.mp3|counter to this propensity for appearance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0700.mp3|for simplification|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0702.mp3|for a cloak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0703.mp3|in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0704.mp3|for an outside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0705.mp3|for every outside is a cloak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0706.mp3|there operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0707.mp3|which takes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0708.mp3|and insists on taking things profoundly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0711.mp3|as a kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0712.mp3|which every courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0714.mp3|as it ought to be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0716.mp3|and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0717.mp3|he will say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0718.mp3|there is something cruel in the tendency of my spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0719.mp3|let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0721.mp3|it would sound nicer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0723.mp3|instead of our cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0724.mp3|perhaps our extravagant honesty were talked about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0726.mp3|and glorified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0727.mp3|we free very free spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0728.mp3|and some day perhaps such will actually be our|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0729.mp3|posthumous glory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0730.mp3|meanwhile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0731.mp3|for there is plenty of time until then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0734.mp3|they are beautiful glistening jingling festive words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0736.mp3|love of truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0737.mp3|love of wisdom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0738.mp3|sacrifice for knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0739.mp3|heroism of the truthful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0740.mp3|there is something in them that makes one's heart swell with pride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0741.mp3|but we anchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the secrecy of an anchorite's conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0742.mp3|that this worthy parade of verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0744.mp3|and gold dust of unconscious human vanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0747.mp3|in effect to translate man back again into nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0748.mp3|to master the many vain and visionary interpretations and subordinate meanings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over the eternal original text|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0750.mp3|hardened by the discipline of science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0751.mp3|stands before the other forms of nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0753.mp3|and stopped ulysses ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0755.mp3|who have piped to him far too long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0756.mp3|thou art more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0757.mp3|thou art higher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0758.mp3|thou hast a different origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0759.mp3|this may be a strange and foolish task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0760.mp3|but that it is a task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0761.mp3|who can deny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0762.mp3|why did we choose it this foolish task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0763.mp3|or to put the question differently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0764.mp3|why knowledge at all every one will ask us about this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0765.mp3|and thus pressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0767.mp3|who have asked ourselves the question a hundred times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0768.mp3|have not found and cannot find any better answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0769.mp3|learning alters us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0770.mp3|it does what all nourishment does that does not merely conserve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0771.mp3|as the physiologist knows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0772.mp3|but at the bottom of our souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0773.mp3|quite down below there is certainly something unteachable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0774.mp3|a granite of spiritual fate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0775.mp3|of predetermined decision and answer to predetermined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0776.mp3|chosen questions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0777.mp3|in each cardinal problem there speaks an unchangeable i am this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0778.mp3|a thinker cannot learn anew about man and woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0780.mp3|but can only learn fully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0782.mp3|occasionally we find certain solutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0783.mp3|perhaps they are henceforth called convictions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0785.mp3|one sees in them only footsteps to self knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0786.mp3|guide posts to the problem which we ourselves are|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0787.mp3|or more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0788.mp3|our spiritual fate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0790.mp3|quite down below|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0791.mp3|in view of this liberal compliment which i have just paid myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0792.mp3|permission will perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths about woman as she is provided that it is known at the outset how literally they are merely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0793.mp3|my truths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0794.mp3|woman wishes to be independent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0795.mp3|and therefore she begins to enlighten men about woman as she is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0796.mp3|this is one of the worst developments of the general uglifying of europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0798.mp3|woman has so much cause for shame|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0817.mp3|is it not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to be scientific|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0825.mp3|i believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally feminine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0826.mp3|why then she wishes to make herself feared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0827.mp3|perhaps she thereby wishes to get the mastery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0829.mp3|from the very first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0830.mp3|nothing is more foreign|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0831.mp3|more repugnant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0833.mp3|her great art is falsehood her chief concern is appearance and beauty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0834.mp3|let us confess it we men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0835.mp3|we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0836.mp3|we who have the hard task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0837.mp3|and for our recreation gladly seek the company of beings under whose hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0839.mp3|and delicate follies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0840.mp3|our seriousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0842.mp3|and profundity appear almost like follies to us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0844.mp3|did a woman herself ever acknowledge profundity in a woman's mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0845.mp3|or justice in a woman's heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0846.mp3|and is it not true that on the whole woman has hitherto been most despised by woman herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0847.mp3|and not at all by us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0848.mp3|we men desire that woman should not continue to compromise herself by enlightening us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0849.mp3|just as it was man's care and the consideration for woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0850.mp3|when the church decreed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0854.mp3|and in my opinion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0857.mp3|it betrays corruption of the instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0858.mp3|apart from the fact that it betrays bad taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0859.mp3|when a woman refers to madame roland|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0862.mp3|as though something were proved thereby in favour of woman as she is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0863.mp3|among men these are the three comical women as they are|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0864.mp3|nothing more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0865.mp3|and just the best involuntary counter arguments against feminine emancipation and autonomy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0866.mp3|stupidity in the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0868.mp3|the terrible thoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master of the house is managed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0869.mp3|woman does not understand what food means|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0870.mp3|and she insists on being cook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0871.mp3|if woman had been a thinking creature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0872.mp3|she should certainly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0873.mp3|as cook for thousands of years|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0876.mp3|through bad female cooks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0877.mp3|through the entire lack of reason in the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0878.mp3|the development of mankind has been longest retarded and most interfered with|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0887.mp3|the motherliest and wisest remark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0889.mp3|that was ever addressed to a son|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0891.mp3|the former when he sang|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0894.mp3|for this is just what she believes of the eternally masculine|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0909.mp3|have come down among them from an elevation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0910.mp3|as something delicate fragile wild strange sweet and animating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0911.mp3|but as something also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0914.mp3|equal training|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0915.mp3|equal claims and obligations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0916.mp3|that is a typical sign of shallow mindedness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0917.mp3|and a thinker who has proved himself shallow at this dangerous spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0918.mp3|shallow in instinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0919.mp3|may generally be regarded as suspicious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0921.mp3|as betrayed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0922.mp3|as discovered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0923.mp3|he will probably prove too short for all fundamental questions of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0924.mp3|future as well as present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0925.mp3|and will be unable to descend into any of the depths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0926.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0927.mp3|a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0928.mp3|and has also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and harshness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0929.mp3|and easily confounded with them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0931.mp3|he must conceive of her as a possession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0932.mp3|as confinable property|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0933.mp3|as a being predestined for service and accomplishing her mission therein|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0934.mp3|he must take his stand in this matter upon the immense rationality of asia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0935.mp3|upon the superiority of the instinct of asia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0936.mp3|as the greeks did formerly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0937.mp3|those best heirs and scholars of asia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0939.mp3|as is well known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0940.mp3|with their increasing culture and amplitude of power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0941.mp3|from homer to the time of pericles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0942.mp3|became gradually stricter towards woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0943.mp3|in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0944.mp3|more oriental|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0945.mp3|how necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0946.mp3|how logical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0947.mp3|even how humanely desirable this was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0948.mp3|let us consider for ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0949.mp3|the weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so much respect by men as at present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0950.mp3|this belongs to the tendency and fundamental taste of democracy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0951.mp3|in the same way as disrespectfulness to old age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0953.mp3|they want more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0954.mp3|they learn to make claims|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0955.mp3|the tribute of respect is at last felt to be well nigh galling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0956.mp3|rivalry for rights indeed actual strife itself would be preferred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0957.mp3|in a word woman is losing modesty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0958.mp3|and let us immediately add that she is also losing taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0959.mp3|she is unlearning to fear man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0960.mp3|but the woman who unlearns to fear sacrifices her most womanly instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0961.mp3|that woman should venture forward when the fear inspiring quality in man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0962.mp3|or more definitely the man in man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0963.mp3|is no longer either desired or fully developed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0964.mp3|is reasonable enough and also intelligible enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0965.mp3|what is more difficult to understand is that precisely thereby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0966.mp3|woman deteriorates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0967.mp3|this is what is happening nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0968.mp3|let us not deceive ourselves about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0969.mp3|wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the military and aristocratic spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0970.mp3|woman strives for the economic and legal independence of a clerk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0972.mp3|while she thus appropriates new rights|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0973.mp3|aspires to be master and inscribes progress of woman on her flags and banners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0975.mp3|woman retrogrades since the french revolution the influence of woman in europe has declined in proportion as she has increased her rights and claims|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0977.mp3|thus proves to be a remarkable symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0978.mp3|there is stupidity in this movement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0979.mp3|an almost masculine stupidity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0980.mp3|of which a well reared woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0981.mp3|who is always a sensible woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0982.mp3|might be heartily ashamed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0983.mp3|to lose the intuition as to the ground upon which she can most surely achieve victory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0984.mp3|to neglect exercise in the use of her proper weapons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0985.mp3|to let herself go before man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0987.mp3|artful humility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0989.mp3|fundamentally different ideal in woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0990.mp3|something eternally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0991.mp3|necessarily feminine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0996.mp3|like some delicate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0997.mp3|strangely wild|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_0998.mp3|and often pleasant domestic animal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1000.mp3|and not rather a condition of every higher culture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1001.mp3|of every elevation of culture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1002.mp3|what does all this betoken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1003.mp3|if not a disintegration of womanly instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1008.mp3|and to imitate all the stupidities from which man in europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1009.mp3|european manliness suffers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1010.mp3|who would like to lower woman to general culture indeed even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1011.mp3|here and there they wish even to make women into free spirits and literary workers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1012.mp3|as though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to a profound and godless man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1013.mp3|almost everywhere her nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music our latest german music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1014.mp3|and she is daily being made more hysterical and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1015.mp3|that of bearing robust children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1016.mp3|they wish to cultivate her in general still more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1018.mp3|as they say|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1020.mp3|as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that the cultivating of mankind and his weakening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1021.mp3|that is to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1022.mp3|the weakening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1025.mp3|have always kept pace with one another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1026.mp3|and that the most powerful and influential women in the world and lastly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1027.mp3|the mother of napoleon had just to thank their force of will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1028.mp3|and not their schoolmasters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1030.mp3|that which inspires respect in woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1031.mp3|and often enough fear also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1032.mp3|is her nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1033.mp3|which is more natural than that of man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1035.mp3|carnivora like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1036.mp3|cunning flexibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1037.mp3|her tiger claws beneath the glove|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1039.mp3|her untrainableness and innate wildness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1040.mp3|the incomprehensibleness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1042.mp3|and deviation of her desires and virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1044.mp3|in spite of fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1045.mp3|excites one's sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1046.mp3|woman is that she seems more afflicted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1047.mp3|more vulnerable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1048.mp3|more necessitous of love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1051.mp3|always with one foot already in tragedy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1052.mp3|which rends while it delights|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1054.mp3|and all that is now to be at an end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1055.mp3|and the disenchantment of woman is in progress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1056.mp3|the tediousness of woman is slowly evolving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1059.mp3|we know the horned animal which was always most attractive to thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1060.mp3|from which danger is ever again threatening thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1061.mp3|thy old fable might once more become history|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1062.mp3|an immense stupidity might once again overmaster thee and carry thee away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_07_nietzsche_1063.mp3|and no god concealed beneath it no|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0002.mp3|it is a piece of magnificent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0005.mp3|latter day art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0006.mp3|which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of music as still living|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0007.mp3|in order that it may be understood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0008.mp3|it is an honour to germans that such a pride did not miscalculate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0009.mp3|what flavours and forces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0010.mp3|what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0011.mp3|it impresses us at one time as ancient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0014.mp3|and too modern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0015.mp3|it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0016.mp3|it is not infrequently roguish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0018.mp3|it has fire and courage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0019.mp3|and at the same time the loose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0020.mp3|dun coloured skin of fruits which ripen too late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0021.mp3|it flows broad and full|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0022.mp3|and suddenly there is a moment of inexplicable hesitation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0023.mp3|like a gap that opens between cause and effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0025.mp3|almost a nightmare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0026.mp3|but already it broadens and widens anew the old stream of delight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0027.mp3|the most manifold delight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0028.mp3|of old and new happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0030.mp3|which he refuses to conceal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0032.mp3|happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here employed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0034.mp3|newly acquired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0039.mp3|no south|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0040.mp3|nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0041.mp3|nothing of grace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0044.mp3|a certain clumsiness even|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0045.mp3|which is also emphasized|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0046.mp3|as though the artist wished to say to us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0047.mp3|it is part of my intention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0048.mp3|a cumbersome drapery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0049.mp3|something arbitrarily barbaric and ceremonious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0051.mp3|something german in the best and worst sense of the word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0052.mp3|something in the german style|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0055.mp3|and inexhaustible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0058.mp3|which perhaps feels itself most at ease there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0060.mp3|genuine token of the german soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0061.mp3|which is at the same time young and aged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0062.mp3|too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0063.mp3|this kind of music expresses best what i think of the germans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0065.mp3|we good europeans we also have hours when we allow ourselves a warm hearted patriotism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0066.mp3|a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrow views|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0067.mp3|i have just given an example of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0068.mp3|hours of national excitement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0069.mp3|of patriotic anguish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0070.mp3|and all other sorts of old fashioned floods of sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0072.mp3|in a considerable time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0073.mp3|some in half a year|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0074.mp3|others in half a lifetime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0075.mp3|according to the speed and strength with which they digest and change their material|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0077.mp3|i could think of sluggish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0078.mp3|hesitating races|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0079.mp3|which even in our rapidly moving europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0081.mp3|and return once more to reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0082.mp3|that is to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0083.mp3|to good europeanism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0084.mp3|and while digressing on this possibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0086.mp3|they were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently spoke all the louder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0087.mp3|he has as much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0088.mp3|and knows as much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0090.mp3|he is still innocent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0091.mp3|but what does that matter nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0092.mp3|it is the age of the masses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0093.mp3|they lie on their belly before everything that is massive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0094.mp3|and so also in politicis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0095.mp3|a statesman who rears up for them a new tower of babel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0096.mp3|some monstrosity of empire and power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0098.mp3|what does it matter that we more prudent and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old belief that it is only the great thought that gives greatness to an action or affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0100.mp3|so that they would have to sacrifice their old and reliable virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0101.mp3|out of love to a new and doubtful mediocrity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0103.mp3|and when in the depths of their souls they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of the restlessness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0107.mp3|were to make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0109.mp3|were to depreciate their most radical proclivities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0110.mp3|subvert their consciences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0111.mp3|make their minds narrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0113.mp3|what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0114.mp3|a statesman who should do all this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0115.mp3|which his people would have to do penance for throughout their whole future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0116.mp3|if they had a future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0119.mp3|undoubtedly replied the other old patriot vehemently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0120.mp3|otherwise he could not have done it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0121.mp3|it was mad perhaps to wish such a thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0123.mp3|misuse of words cried his interlocutor contradictorily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0126.mp3|strong and mad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0128.mp3|the old men had obviously become heated as they thus shouted their truths in each other's faces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0133.mp3|namely in the deepening of another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0135.mp3|whether we call it simply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0136.mp3|without praise or blame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0137.mp3|by the political formula the democratic movement in europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0138.mp3|behind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to by such formulas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0139.mp3|an immense physiological process goes on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0140.mp3|which is ever extending the process of the assimilation of europeans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0141.mp3|their increasing detachment from the conditions under which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0143.mp3|united races originate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0145.mp3|that for centuries would fain inscribe itself with equal demands on soul and body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0146.mp3|that is to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0148.mp3|who possesses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0149.mp3|physiologically speaking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0150.mp3|a maximum of the art and power of adaptation as his typical distinction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0151.mp3|this process of the evolving european|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0153.mp3|but will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0154.mp3|the still raging storm and stress of national sentiment pertains to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0155.mp3|and also the anarchism which is appearing at present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0157.mp3|the apostles of modern ideas would least care to reckon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0160.mp3|industrious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0161.mp3|variously serviceable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0163.mp3|are in the highest degree suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and attractive qualities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0165.mp3|while the capacity for adaptation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0167.mp3|and begins a new work with every generation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0168.mp3|almost with every decade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0169.mp3|makes the powerfulness of the type impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0170.mp3|while the collective impression of such future europeans will probably be that of numerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0173.mp3|and very handy workmen who require a master|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0174.mp3|a commander|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0175.mp3|as they require their daily bread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0177.mp3|therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0179.mp3|the strong man will necessarily in individual and exceptional cases|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0180.mp3|become stronger and richer than he has perhaps ever been before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0181.mp3|owing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0182.mp3|owing to the immense variety of practice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0184.mp3|and disguise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0186.mp3|taking the word in all its meanings even in its most spiritual sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0188.mp3|and i hope that the men on this earth will do like the sun|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0189.mp3|and we foremost we good europeans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0190.mp3|there was a time when it was customary to call germans deep by way of distinction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0193.mp3|it is almost opportune and patriotic to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that commendation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0194.mp3|in short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0195.mp3|whether german depth is not at bottom something different and worse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0196.mp3|and something from which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0197.mp3|thank god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0198.mp3|we are on the point of successfully ridding ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0201.mp3|the german soul is above all manifold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0202.mp3|varied in its source|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0204.mp3|rather than actually built|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0205.mp3|this is owing to its origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0206.mp3|a german who would embolden himself to assert|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0209.mp3|dwell in my breast would make a bad guess at the truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0211.mp3|more correctly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0213.mp3|as a people made up of the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0215.mp3|the germans are more intangible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0216.mp3|more ample|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0217.mp3|more contradictory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0218.mp3|more unknown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0219.mp3|more incalculable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0220.mp3|more surprising|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0221.mp3|and even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0222.mp3|they escape definition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0223.mp3|and are thereby alone the despair of the french|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0224.mp3|it is characteristic of the germans that the question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0225.mp3|what is german never dies out among them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0227.mp3|we are known they cried jubilantly to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0228.mp3|but sand also thought he knew them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0233.mp3|but about many things around him he never spoke explicitly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0234.mp3|and all his life he knew how to keep an astute silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0235.mp3|probably he had good reason for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0236.mp3|it is certain that it was not the wars of independence that made him look up more joyfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0237.mp3|any more than it was the french revolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0238.mp3|the event on account of which he reconstructed his faust and indeed the whole problem of man was the appearance of napoleon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0240.mp3|as from a foreign land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0241.mp3|that which germans take a pride in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0244.mp3|it is characteristic of germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0245.mp3|the german soul has passages and galleries in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0246.mp3|there are caves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0247.mp3|hiding places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0248.mp3|and dungeons therein|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0249.mp3|its disorder has much of the charm of the mysterious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0250.mp3|the german is well acquainted with the bypaths to chaos|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0251.mp3|and as everything loves its symbol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0252.mp3|so the german loves the clouds and all that is obscure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0256.mp3|and shrouded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0257.mp3|it seems to him that everything uncertain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0258.mp3|undeveloped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0260.mp3|and growing is deep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0261.mp3|the german himself does not exist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0262.mp3|he is becoming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0263.mp3|he is developing himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0264.mp3|development is therefore the essentially german discovery and hit in the great domain of philosophical formulas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0265.mp3|a ruling idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0267.mp3|together with german beer and german music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0270.mp3|good natured and spiteful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0271.mp3|such a juxtaposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0272.mp3|preposterous in the case of every other people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0273.mp3|is unfortunately only too often justified in germany one has only to live for a while among swabians to know this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0277.mp3|let him only look at german taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0278.mp3|at german arts and manners what boorish indifference to taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0280.mp3|how disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution of this soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0281.mp3|the german drags at his soul he drags at everything he experiences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0282.mp3|he digests his events badly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0283.mp3|he never gets done with them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0284.mp3|and german depth is often only a difficult hesitating digestion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0285.mp3|and just as all chronic invalids|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0287.mp3|so the german loves frankness and honesty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0288.mp3|it is so convenient to be frank and honest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0289.mp3|this confidingness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0290.mp3|this complaisance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0291.mp3|this showing the cards of german honesty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0292.mp3|is probably the most dangerous and most successful disguise which the german is up to nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0294.mp3|with this he can still achieve much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0295.mp3|the german lets himself go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0296.mp3|and thereby gazes with faithful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0298.mp3|empty german eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0299.mp3|and other countries immediately confound him with his dressing gown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0300.mp3|i meant to say that let german depth be what it will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0301.mp3|among ourselves alone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh at it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0302.mp3|we shall do well to continue henceforth to honour its appearance and good name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0304.mp3|it is wise for a people to pose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0305.mp3|and let itself be regarded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0306.mp3|as profound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0308.mp3|good natured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0309.mp3|honest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0310.mp3|and foolish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0311.mp3|it might even be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0313.mp3|finally we should do honour to our name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0315.mp3|the good old time is past it sang itself out in mozart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0316.mp3|how happy are we that his rococo still speaks to us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0317.mp3|that his good company his tender enthusiasm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0319.mp3|his courtesy of heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0320.mp3|his longing for the elegant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0321.mp3|the amorous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0322.mp3|the tripping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0323.mp3|the tearful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0324.mp3|and his belief in the south|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0325.mp3|can still appeal to something left in us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0326.mp3|ah some time or other it will be over with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0327.mp3|but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with the intelligence and taste for beethoven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0328.mp3|for he was only the last echo of a break and transition in style|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0330.mp3|like mozart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0331.mp3|the last echo of a great european taste which had existed for centuries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0332.mp3|beethoven is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly breaking down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0333.mp3|and a future over young soul that is always coming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0334.mp3|there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal extravagant hope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0336.mp3|when it danced round the tree of liberty of the revolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0337.mp3|and finally almost fell down in adoration before napoleon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0338.mp3|but how rapidly does this very sentiment now pale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0339.mp3|how difficult nowadays is even the apprehension of this sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0340.mp3|how strangely does the language of rousseau|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0343.mp3|and byron sound to our ear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0344.mp3|in whom collectively the same fate of europe was able to speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0345.mp3|which knew how to sing in beethoven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0346.mp3|whatever german music came afterwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0347.mp3|belongs to romanticism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0350.mp3|historically considered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0351.mp3|was still shorter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0354.mp3|the transition of europe from rousseau to napoleon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0355.mp3|and to the rise of democracy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0359.mp3|that is extinct although not yet forgotten music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0361.mp3|besides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0362.mp3|was not noble enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0363.mp3|was not musical enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0364.mp3|to maintain its position anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0365.mp3|from the beginning it was second rate music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0366.mp3|which was little thought of by genuine musicians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0369.mp3|who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0370.mp3|on account of his lighter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0372.mp3|happier soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0373.mp3|quickly acquired admiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0374.mp3|and was equally quickly forgotten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0375.mp3|as the beautiful episode of german music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0376.mp3|but with regard to robert schumann|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0377.mp3|who took things seriously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0378.mp3|and has been taken seriously from the first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0379.mp3|he was the last that founded a school|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0380.mp3|do we not now regard it as a satisfaction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0382.mp3|a deliverance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0383.mp3|that this very romanticism of schumann's has been surmounted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0385.mp3|fleeing into the saxon switzerland of his soul|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0389.mp3|his manfred music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of injustice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0391.mp3|with his taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0393.mp3|a dangerous propensity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0394.mp3|doubly dangerous among germans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0395.mp3|for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0396.mp3|going constantly apart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0397.mp3|timidly withdrawing and retiring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0398.mp3|a noble weakling who revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0400.mp3|this schumann was already merely a german event in music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0401.mp3|and no longer a european event|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0402.mp3|as beethoven had been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0403.mp3|as in a still greater degree mozart had been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0404.mp3|with schumann german music was threatened with its greatest danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0405.mp3|that of losing the voice for the soul of europe and sinking into a merely national affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0407.mp3|how indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swamp of sounds without tune and rhythms without dance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0408.mp3|which germans call a book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0409.mp3|and even the german who reads books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0410.mp3|how lazily how reluctantly how badly he reads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0412.mp3|and consider it obligatory to know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0413.mp3|that there is art in every good sentence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0414.mp3|art which must be divined if the sentence is to be understood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0415.mp3|if there is a misunderstanding about its tempo|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0416.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0417.mp3|the sentence itself is misunderstood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0419.mp3|that one should feel the breaking of the too rigid symmetry as intentional and as a charm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0422.mp3|and how delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of their arrangement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0424.mp3|and to listen to so much art and intention in language|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0425.mp3|after all one just has no ear for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0426.mp3|and so the most marked contrasts of style are not heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0428.mp3|these were my thoughts when i noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two masters in the art of prose writing have been confounded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0431.mp3|as from the roof of a damp cave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0432.mp3|he counts on their dull sound and echo|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0433.mp3|and another who manipulates his language like a flexible sword|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0434.mp3|and from his arm down into his toes feels the dangerous bliss of the quivering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0435.mp3|over sharp blade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0436.mp3|which wishes to bite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0438.mp3|and cut|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0439.mp3|how little the german style has to do with harmony and with the ear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0440.mp3|is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselves write badly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0441.mp3|the german does not read aloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0442.mp3|he does not read for the ear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0443.mp3|but only with his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0444.mp3|he has put his ears away in the drawer for the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0445.mp3|in antiquity when a man read|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0446.mp3|which was seldom enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0447.mp3|he read something to himself and in a loud voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0448.mp3|they were surprised when any one read silently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0449.mp3|and sought secretly the reason of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0450.mp3|in a loud voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0452.mp3|with all the swellings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0454.mp3|and variations of key and changes of tempo|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0455.mp3|in which the ancient public world took delight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0456.mp3|the laws of the written style were then the same as those of the spoken style|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0457.mp3|and these laws depended partly on the surprising development and refined requirements of the ear and larynx|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0458.mp3|partly on the strength endurance and power of the ancient lungs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0459.mp3|in the ancient sense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0460.mp3|a period is above all a physiological whole|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0461.mp3|inasmuch as it is comprised in one breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0462.mp3|such periods as occur in demosthenes and cicero|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0464.mp3|and all in one breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0465.mp3|were pleasures to the men of antiquity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0466.mp3|who knew by their own schooling how to appreciate the virtue therein|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0468.mp3|we have really no right to the big period|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0471.mp3|those ancients|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0474.mp3|consequently connoisseurs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0475.mp3|consequently critics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0476.mp3|they thus brought their orators to the highest pitch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0477.mp3|in the same manner as in the last century|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0478.mp3|when all italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0479.mp3|the virtuosoship of song and with it also the art of melody reached its elevation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0481.mp3|however until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0482.mp3|there was properly speaking only one kind of public and approximately artistical discourse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0483.mp3|that delivered from the pulpit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0484.mp3|the preacher was the only one in germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0485.mp3|in what manner a sentence strikes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0489.mp3|and comes to a close|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0490.mp3|he alone had a conscience in his ears often enough a bad conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0491.mp3|for reasons are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom attained by a german|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0492.mp3|or almost always too late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0493.mp3|the masterpiece of german prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of its greatest preacher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0494.mp3|the bible has hitherto been the best german book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0495.mp3|compared with luther's bible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0496.mp3|almost everything else is merely literature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0497.mp3|something which has not grown in germany|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0498.mp3|and therefore has not taken and does not take root in german hearts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0499.mp3|as the bible has done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0500.mp3|there are two kinds of geniuses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0501.mp3|one which above all engenders and seeks to engender|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0502.mp3|and another which willingly lets itself be fructified and brings forth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0503.mp3|and similarly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0504.mp3|among the gifted nations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0505.mp3|there are those on whom the woman's problem of pregnancy has devolved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0508.mp3|and perfecting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0513.mp3|and others which have to fructify and become the cause of new modes of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0514.mp3|like the jews the romans and in all modesty be it asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0515.mp3|like the germans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0516.mp3|nations tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers and irresistibly forced out of themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0517.mp3|amorous and longing for foreign races for such as let themselves be fructified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0519.mp3|like everything conscious of being full of generative force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0520.mp3|and consequently empowered by the grace of god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0521.mp3|these two kinds of geniuses seek each other like man and woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0522.mp3|but they also misunderstand each other like man and woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0524.mp3|one does not know cannot know the best that is in one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0525.mp3|what europe owes to the jews|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0527.mp3|good and bad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0528.mp3|and above all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0529.mp3|the grand style in morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0530.mp3|the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0531.mp3|of infinite significations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0532.mp3|the whole romanticism and sublimity of moral questionableness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0533.mp3|and consequently just the most attractive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0535.mp3|and exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0536.mp3|in the aftersheen of which the sky of our european culture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0539.mp3|perhaps glows out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0541.mp3|grateful to the jews|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0543.mp3|if various clouds and disturbances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0544.mp3|in short slight attacks of stupidity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0545.mp3|pass over the spirit of a people that suffers and wants to suffer from national nervous fever and political ambition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0546.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0547.mp3|among present day germans there is alternately the anti french folly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0548.mp3|the anti semitic folly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0549.mp3|the anti polish folly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0550.mp3|the christian romantic folly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0552.mp3|the teutonic folly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0553.mp3|the prussian folly just look at those poor historians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0555.mp3|and their closely bandaged heads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0556.mp3|and whatever else these little obscurations of the german spirit and conscience may be called|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0557.mp3|may it be forgiven me that i|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0559.mp3|when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0560.mp3|did not remain wholly exempt from the disease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0562.mp3|began to entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0563.mp3|the first symptom of political infection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0564.mp3|about the jews for instance listen to the following|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0565.mp3|i have never yet met a german who was favourably inclined to the jews|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0567.mp3|this prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the sentiment itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0568.mp3|but only against its dangerous excess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0569.mp3|and especially against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0570.mp3|on this point we must not deceive ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0571.mp3|that germany has amply sufficient jews|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0573.mp3|the german blood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0575.mp3|as the italian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0578.mp3|that is the unmistakable declaration and language of a general instinct|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0579.mp3|to which one must listen and according to which one must act|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0580.mp3|let no more jews come in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0581.mp3|and shut the doors|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0594.mp3|which one would like nowadays to label as vices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0595.mp3|owing above all to a resolute faith which does not need to be ashamed before modern ideas|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0598.mp3|in the same way that the russian empire makes its conquest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0599.mp3|as an empire that has plenty of time and is not of yesterday|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0615.mp3|as the jews are such nations should most carefully avoid all hot headed rivalry and hostility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0616.mp3|it is certain that the jews if they desired|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0626.mp3|to be insorbed and absorbed by europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0627.mp3|they long to be finally settled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0629.mp3|and respected somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0630.mp3|and wish to put an end to the nomadic life|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0635.mp3|and with selection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0636.mp3|pretty much as the english nobility do it stands to reason that the more powerful and strongly marked types of new germanism could enter into relation with the jews with the least hesitation|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0691.mp3|a penitential fit may really be the relatively highest manifestation of humanity to which they can be elevated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0692.mp3|so much may reasonably be admitted|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0712.mp3|who could doubt that it is a useful thing for such minds to have the ascendancy for a time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0714.mp3|and deducing conclusions from them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0715.mp3|as exceptions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0717.mp3|after all they have more to do than merely to perceive|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0729.mp3|for scientific discoveries like those of darwin|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0735.mp3|let it not be forgotten that the english|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0737.mp3|brought about once before a general depression of european intelligence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0738.mp3|what is called modern ideas or the ideas of the eighteenth century or french ideas|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0800.mp3|one can safely predict that beforehand|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0806.mp3|in spite of all voluntary or involuntary germanizing and vulgarizing of taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0807.mp3|the capacity for artistic emotion|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0811.mp3|has been invented|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0812.mp3|such capacity has not been lacking in france for three centuries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0813.mp3|and owing to its reverence for the small number it has again and again made a sort of chamber music of literature possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0814.mp3|which is sought for in vain elsewhere in europe|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0826.mp3|as we have said|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0836.mp3|traversed his europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0838.mp3|several centuries of the european soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0839.mp3|as a surveyor and discoverer thereof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0841.mp3|to divine long afterwards some of the riddles that perplexed and enraptured him|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0848.mp3|which an englishman can never comprehend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0849.mp3|their temperament|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0861.mp3|there is also still in france a pre understanding and ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0871.mp3|as a great school of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0873.mp3|well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0874.mp3|such a person will learn to be somewhat on his guard against german music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0875.mp3|because|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0876.mp3|in injuring his taste anew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0877.mp3|it will also injure his health anew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0878.mp3|such a southerner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0880.mp3|if he should dream of the future of music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0881.mp3|must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the north|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0882.mp3|and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0884.mp3|and perhaps more perverse and mysterious music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0885.mp3|a super german music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0886.mp3|which does not fade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0888.mp3|and die away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0889.mp3|as all german music does|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0891.mp3|wanton sea and the mediterranean clearness of sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0892.mp3|a super european music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0893.mp3|which holds its own even in presence of the brown sunsets of the desert|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0894.mp3|whose soul is akin to the palm tree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0895.mp3|and can be at home and can roam with big|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0897.mp3|lonely beasts of prey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0898.mp3|i could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew nothing more of good and evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0900.mp3|some golden shadows and tender weaknesses might sweep lightly over it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0901.mp3|an art which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0902.mp3|from the far distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0903.mp3|would see the colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible moral world fleeing towards it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0904.mp3|and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to receive such belated fugitives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0905.mp3|owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality craze has induced and still induces among the nations of europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0906.mp3|owing also to the short sighted and hasty handed politicians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0907.mp3|who with the help of this craze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0908.mp3|are at present in power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0909.mp3|and do not suspect to what extent the disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude policy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0910.mp3|owing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable at present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0912.mp3|are now overlooked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0913.mp3|or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0914.mp3|with all the more profound and large minded men of this century|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0915.mp3|the real general tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the way for that new synthesis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0916.mp3|and tentatively to anticipate the european of the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0917.mp3|only in their simulations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0918.mp3|or in their weaker moments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0919.mp3|in old age perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0920.mp3|did they belong to the fatherlands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0921.mp3|they only rested from themselves when they became patriots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0922.mp3|i think of such men as napoleon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0927.mp3|schopenhauer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0928.mp3|it must not be taken amiss if i also count richard wagner among them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0934.mp3|nevertheless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0935.mp3|that richard wagner and the later french romanticism of the forties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0936.mp3|are most closely and intimately related to one another|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0939.mp3|in all the heights and depths of their requirements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0940.mp3|it is europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0941.mp3|the one europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0942.mp3|whose soul presses urgently and longingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0943.mp3|outwards and upwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0944.mp3|in their multifarious and boisterous art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0945.mp3|whither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0946.mp3|into a new light|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0948.mp3|but who would attempt to express accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could not express distinctly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0949.mp3|it is certain that the same storm and stress tormented them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0950.mp3|that they sought in the same manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0951.mp3|these last great seekers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0952.mp3|all of them steeped in literature to their eyes and ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0954.mp3|for the most part even themselves writers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0955.mp3|poets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0957.mp3|as musician is reckoned among painters|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_0999.mp3|or whether its distinction does not consist precisely in coming from super german sources and impulses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_1000.mp3|in which connection it may not be underrated how indispensable paris was to the development of his type|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_1001.mp3|which the strength of his instincts made him long to visit at the most decisive time|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_1004.mp3|could only perfect itself in sight of the french socialistic original|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_1005.mp3|on a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be found|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_1007.mp3|that he has acted in everything with more strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_08_nietzsche_1011.mp3|owing to the circumstance that we germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the french|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0006.mp3|and out of their equally constant practice of obeying and commanding|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0007.mp3|of keeping down and keeping at a distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0008.mp3|that other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0019.mp3|of the preliminary condition for the elevation of the type man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0020.mp3|the truth is hard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0021.mp3|let us acknowledge unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto has originated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0022.mp3|men with a still natural nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0023.mp3|barbarians in every terrible sense of the word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0024.mp3|men of prey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0025.mp3|still in possession of unbroken strength of will and desire for power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0026.mp3|threw themselves upon weaker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0029.mp3|or upon old mellow civilizations in which the final vital force was flickering out in brilliant fireworks of wit and depravity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0030.mp3|at the commencement the noble caste was always the barbarian caste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0031.mp3|their superiority did not consist first of all in their physical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0032.mp3|but in their psychical power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0033.mp3|they were more complete men which at every point also implies the same as more complete beasts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0034.mp3|corruption|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0035.mp3|as the indication that anarchy threatens to break out among the instincts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0036.mp3|and that the foundation of the emotions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0037.mp3|called life is convulsed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0038.mp3|is something radically different according to the organization in which it manifests itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0041.mp3|an aristocracy like that of france at the beginning of the revolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0042.mp3|flung away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself to an excess of its moral sentiments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0043.mp3|it was corruption|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0044.mp3|it was really only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for centuries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0045.mp3|by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its lordly prerogatives and lowered itself to a function of royalty in the end even to its decoration and parade dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0046.mp3|the essential thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0048.mp3|in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard itself as a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0049.mp3|but as the significance and highest justification thereof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0050.mp3|that it should therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion of individuals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0052.mp3|must be suppressed and reduced to imperfect men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0054.mp3|its fundamental belief must be precisely that society is not allowed to exist for its own sake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0055.mp3|but only as a foundation and scaffolding|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0056.mp3|by means of which a select class of beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0057.mp3|and in general to a higher existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0058.mp3|like those sun seeking climbing plants in java|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0060.mp3|which encircle an oak so long and so often with their arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0061.mp3|until at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0062.mp3|high above it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0063.mp3|but supported by it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0064.mp3|they can unfold their tops in the open light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0065.mp3|and exhibit their happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0067.mp3|from violence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0068.mp3|from exploitation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0069.mp3|and put one's will on a par with that of others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0070.mp3|this may result in a certain rough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessary conditions are given namely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0071.mp3|the actual similarity of the individuals in amount of force and degree of worth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0075.mp3|as one wished to take this principle more generally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0076.mp3|and if possible even as the fundamental principle of society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0077.mp3|it would immediately disclose what it really is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0079.mp3|a will to the denial of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0080.mp3|a principle of dissolution and decay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0081.mp3|here one must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental weakness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0082.mp3|life itself is essentially appropriation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0084.mp3|conquest of the strange and weak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0089.mp3|and at the least|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0090.mp3|putting it mildest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0091.mp3|exploitation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0092.mp3|but why should one for ever use precisely these words on which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0093.mp3|even the organization within which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0094.mp3|as was previously supposed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0095.mp3|the individuals treat each other as equal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0096.mp3|it takes place in every healthy aristocracy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0097.mp3|must itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0098.mp3|if it be a living and not a dying organization|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0100.mp3|which the individuals within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the incarnated will to power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0101.mp3|it will endeavour to grow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0102.mp3|to gain ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0103.mp3|attract to itself and acquire ascendancy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0104.mp3|not owing to any morality or immorality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0105.mp3|but because it lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0106.mp3|and because life is precisely will to power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0107.mp3|on no point|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0108.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0109.mp3|is the ordinary consciousness of europeans more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0110.mp3|people now rave everywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0111.mp3|even under the guise of science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0112.mp3|about coming conditions of society in which the exploiting character is to be absent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0113.mp3|that sounds to my ears as if they promised to invent a mode of life which should refrain from all organic functions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0115.mp3|or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of the living being as a primary organic function|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0116.mp3|it is a consequence of the intrinsic will to power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0117.mp3|which is precisely the will to life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0118.mp3|granting that as a theory this is a novelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0119.mp3|as a reality it is the fundamental fact of all history let us be so far honest towards ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0120.mp3|in a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0121.mp3|i found certain traits recurring regularly together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0122.mp3|and connected with one another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0123.mp3|until finally two primary types revealed themselves to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0124.mp3|and a radical distinction was brought to light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0125.mp3|there is master morality and slave morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0126.mp3|i would at once add|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0127.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0128.mp3|that in all higher and mixed civilizations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0129.mp3|there are also attempts at the reconciliation of the two moralities|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0131.mp3|indeed sometimes their close juxtaposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0134.mp3|pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0135.mp3|or among the ruled class the slaves and dependents of all sorts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0136.mp3|in the first case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0137.mp3|when it is the rulers who determine the conception good it is the exalted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0138.mp3|proud disposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0139.mp3|and that which determines the order of rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0140.mp3|the noble type of man separates from himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0143.mp3|the antithesis good and evil is of a different origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0144.mp3|the cowardly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0145.mp3|the timid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0146.mp3|the insignificant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0147.mp3|and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0150.mp3|the distrustful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0151.mp3|with their constrained glances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0153.mp3|the dog like kind of men who let themselves be abused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0154.mp3|the mendicant flatterers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0155.mp3|and above all the liars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0156.mp3|it is a fundamental belief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0157.mp3|we truthful ones the nobility in ancient greece called themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0158.mp3|it is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0159.mp3|and were only derivatively and at a later period applied to actions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0160.mp3|it is a gross mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0162.mp3|when historians of morals start with questions like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0163.mp3|why have sympathetic actions been praised the noble type of man regards himself as a determiner of values|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0164.mp3|he does not require to be approved of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0165.mp3|he passes the judgment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0166.mp3|what is injurious to me is injurious in itself he knows that it is he himself only who confers honour on things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0169.mp3|in the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0171.mp3|which seeks to overflow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0172.mp3|the happiness of high tension|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0173.mp3|the consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0178.mp3|the noble man honours in himself the powerful one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0179.mp3|him also who has power over himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0180.mp3|who knows how to speak and how to keep silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0181.mp3|who takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0182.mp3|and has reverence for all that is severe and hard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0184.mp3|it is thus rightly expressed from the soul of a proud viking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0185.mp3|such a type of man is even proud of not being made for sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0186.mp3|the hero of the saga therefore adds warningly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0187.mp3|he who has not a hard heart when young will never have one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0189.mp3|or in acting for the good of others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0191.mp3|the characteristic of the moral|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0194.mp3|a radical enmity and irony towards selflessness belong as definitely to noble morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0197.mp3|it is their art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0198.mp3|their domain for invention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0200.mp3|all law rests on this double reverence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0202.mp3|is typical in the morality of the powerful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0203.mp3|and if|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0204.mp3|reversely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0205.mp3|men of modern ideas believe almost instinctively in progress and the future and are more and more lacking in respect for old age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0206.mp3|the ignoble origin of these ideas has complacently betrayed itself thereby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0207.mp3|a morality of the ruling class|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0209.mp3|is more especially foreign and irritating to present day taste in the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to one's equals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0210.mp3|that one may act towards beings of a lower rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0211.mp3|towards all that is foreign|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0212.mp3|just as seems good to one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0213.mp3|or as the heart desires and in any case beyond good and evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0214.mp3|it is here that sympathy and similar sentiments can have a place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0215.mp3|the ability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0216.mp3|both only within the circle of equals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0217.mp3|artfulness in retaliation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0219.mp3|a certain necessity to have enemies as outlets for the emotions of envy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0220.mp3|quarrelsomeness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0222.mp3|in fact in order to be a good friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0223.mp3|all these are typical characteristics of the noble morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0224.mp3|which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0225.mp3|as has been pointed out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0226.mp3|is not the morality of modern ideas and is therefore at present difficult to realize|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0227.mp3|and also to unearth and disclose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0228.mp3|it is otherwise with the second type of morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0229.mp3|slave morality supposing that the abused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0230.mp3|the oppressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0231.mp3|the suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0232.mp3|the unemancipated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0233.mp3|the weary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0234.mp3|and those uncertain of themselves should moralize|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0235.mp3|what will be the common element in their moral estimates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0236.mp3|probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0237.mp3|perhaps a condemnation of man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0238.mp3|together with his situation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0239.mp3|the slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the powerful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0240.mp3|he has a skepticism and distrust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0242.mp3|he would fain persuade himself that the very happiness there is not genuine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0243.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0244.mp3|those qualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are brought into prominence and flooded with light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0245.mp3|it is here that sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0246.mp3|the kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0247.mp3|helping hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0248.mp3|the warm heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0253.mp3|for here these are the most useful qualities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0254.mp3|and almost the only means of supporting the burden of existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0255.mp3|slave morality is essentially the morality of utility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0256.mp3|here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0257.mp3|power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0258.mp3|a certain dreadfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0262.mp3|according to slave morality therefore the evil man arouses fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0263.mp3|according to master morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0264.mp3|it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0265.mp3|while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0266.mp3|the contrast attains its maximum when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0267.mp3|in accordance with the logical consequences of slave morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0268.mp3|a shade of depreciation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0272.mp3|according to the servile mode of thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0273.mp3|the good man must in any case be the safe man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0274.mp3|he is good natured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0275.mp3|easily deceived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0276.mp3|perhaps a little stupid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0278.mp3|everywhere that slave morality gains the ascendancy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0279.mp3|language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words good and stupid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0280.mp3|a last fundamental difference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0281.mp3|the desire for freedom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0282.mp3|the instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty belong as necessarily to slave morals and morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0283.mp3|as artifice and enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0284.mp3|hence we can understand without further detail why love as a passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0286.mp3|must absolutely be of noble origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0287.mp3|as is well known|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0288.mp3|its invention is due to the provencal poet cavaliers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0289.mp3|those brilliant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0291.mp3|and almost owes itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0292.mp3|vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for a noble man to understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0293.mp3|he will be tempted to deny it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0295.mp3|the problem for him is to represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion of themselves which they themselves do not possess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0296.mp3|and consequently also do not deserve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0297.mp3|and who yet believe in this good opinion afterwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0298.mp3|this seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so self disrespectful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0299.mp3|and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0300.mp3|that he would like to consider vanity an exception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0301.mp3|and is doubtful about it in most cases when it is spoken of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0302.mp3|he will say for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0303.mp3|i may be mistaken about my value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0304.mp3|and on the other hand may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others precisely as i rate it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0312.mp3|for many reasons i can delight in the good opinion of others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0313.mp3|perhaps because i love and honour them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0314.mp3|and rejoice in all their joys|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0315.mp3|perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0316.mp3|perhaps because the good opinion of others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0317.mp3|even in cases where i do not share it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0318.mp3|is useful to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0319.mp3|or gives promise of usefulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0320.mp3|all this however is not vanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0321.mp3|the man of noble character must first bring it home forcibly to his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0322.mp3|especially with the aid of history|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0324.mp3|from time immemorial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0325.mp3|in all social strata in any way dependent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0326.mp3|the ordinary man was only that which he passed for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0327.mp3|not being at all accustomed to fix values|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0328.mp3|he did not assign even to himself any other value than that which his master assigned to him it is the peculiar right of masters to create values|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0329.mp3|it may be looked upon as the result of an extraordinary atavism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0330.mp3|that the ordinary man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0331.mp3|even at present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0332.mp3|is still always waiting for an opinion about himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0333.mp3|and then instinctively submitting himself to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0334.mp3|yet by no means only to a good opinion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0335.mp3|but also to a bad and unjust one think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0337.mp3|of the greater part of the self appreciations and self depreciations which believing women learn from their confessors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0338.mp3|and which in general the believing christian learns from his church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0339.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0340.mp3|conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order and its cause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0341.mp3|the blending of the blood of masters and slaves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0342.mp3|the originally noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to themselves and to think well of themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0343.mp3|will now be more and more encouraged and extended|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0344.mp3|but it has at all times an older|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0346.mp3|and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0347.mp3|and in the phenomenon of vanity this older propensity overmasters the younger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0348.mp3|the vain person rejoices over every good opinion which he hears about himself quite apart from the point of view of its usefulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0349.mp3|and equally regardless of its truth or falsehood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0350.mp3|just as he suffers from every bad opinion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0351.mp3|for he subjects himself to both|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0352.mp3|he feels himself subjected to both|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0353.mp3|by that oldest instinct of subjection which breaks forth in him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0354.mp3|it is the slave in the vain man's blood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0355.mp3|the remains of the slave's craftiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0356.mp3|and how much of the slave is still left in woman for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0357.mp3|which seeks to seduce to good opinions of itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0358.mp3|it is the slave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0360.mp3|who immediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0361.mp3|as though he had not called them forth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0362.mp3|and to repeat it again vanity is an atavism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0363.mp3|a species originates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0365.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0367.mp3|and in general a surplus of protection and care|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0368.mp3|immediately tend in the most marked way to develop variations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0370.mp3|now look at an aristocratic commonwealth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0373.mp3|as a voluntary or involuntary contrivance for the purpose of rearing human beings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0375.mp3|thrown upon their own resources|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0376.mp3|who want to make their species prevail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0377.mp3|chiefly because they must prevail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0378.mp3|or else run the terrible danger of being exterminated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0382.mp3|the species needs itself as species|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0383.mp3|as something which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0384.mp3|precisely by virtue of its hardness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0386.mp3|and simplicity of structure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0387.mp3|can in general prevail and make itself permanent in constant struggle with its neighbours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0388.mp3|or with rebellious or rebellion threatening vassals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0389.mp3|the most varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0390.mp3|in spite of all gods and men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0391.mp3|and has hitherto been victorious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0392.mp3|these qualities it calls virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0393.mp3|and these virtues alone it develops to maturity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0394.mp3|it does so with severity indeed it desires severity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0395.mp3|every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education of youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0396.mp3|in the control of women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0397.mp3|in the marriage customs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0399.mp3|in the penal laws which have an eye only for the degenerating|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0402.mp3|a type with few|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0404.mp3|a species of severe|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0409.mp3|with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and nuances of society is thus established|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0410.mp3|unaffected by the vicissitudes of generations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0411.mp3|the constant struggle with uniform unfavourable conditions is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0413.mp3|the cause of a type becoming stable and hard|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0416.mp3|a happy state of things results|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0417.mp3|the enormous tension is relaxed|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0424.mp3|if it would continue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0425.mp3|it can only do so as a form of luxury|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0427.mp3|whether they be deviations into the higher|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0432.mp3|the individual dares to be individual and detach himself|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0435.mp3|and often mixed and entangled together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0436.mp3|a magnificent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0439.mp3|a kind of tropical tempo in the rivalry of growth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0440.mp3|and an extraordinary decay and self destruction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0441.mp3|owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoisms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0444.mp3|or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0445.mp3|it was this morality itself which piled up the strength so enormously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0446.mp3|which bent the bow in so threatening a manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0447.mp3|it is now out of date it is getting out of date|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0448.mp3|the dangerous and disquieting point has been reached when the greater|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0450.mp3|more comprehensive life is lived beyond the old morality|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0452.mp3|and is obliged to have recourse to his own law giving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0453.mp3|his own arts and artifices for self preservation|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0476.mp3|that the end is quickly approaching|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0513.mp3|a hesitation of the eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0514.mp3|a cessation of all gestures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0515.mp3|by which it is indicated that a soul feels the nearness of what is worthiest of respect|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0517.mp3|on the whole|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0518.mp3|the reverence for the bible has hitherto been maintained in europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0519.mp3|is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of manners which europe owes to christianity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0520.mp3|books of such profoundness and supreme significance require for their protection an external tyranny of authority|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0523.mp3|that there are holy experiences before which they must take off their shoes and keep away the unclean hand|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0525.mp3|on the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0526.mp3|in the so called cultured classes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0527.mp3|the believers in modern ideas nothing is perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0528.mp3|the easy insolence of eye and hand with which they touch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0530.mp3|and finger everything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0531.mp3|and it is possible that even yet there is more relative nobility of taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0533.mp3|among the lower classes of the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0534.mp3|especially among peasants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0536.mp3|the cultured class|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0538.mp3|whether they were perhaps diligent economizers attached to a desk and a cash box|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0542.mp3|fond of rude pleasures and probably of still ruder duties and responsibilities|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0545.mp3|at one time or another|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0549.mp3|as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0550.mp3|which blushes at every compromise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0551.mp3|it is quite impossible for a man not to have the qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in his constitution|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0555.mp3|it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0556.mp3|any kind of offensive incontinence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0557.mp3|any kind of sordid envy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0558.mp3|or of clumsy self vaunting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0559.mp3|the three things which together have constituted the genuine plebeian type in all times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0560.mp3|such must pass over to the child as surely as bad blood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0561.mp3|and with the help of the best education and culture one will only succeed in deceiving with regard to such heredity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0562.mp3|and what else does education and culture try to do nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0566.mp3|education and culture must be essentially the art of deceiving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0567.mp3|deceiving with regard to origin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0569.mp3|an educator who nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0570.mp3|and called out constantly to his pupils|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0575.mp3|with what results|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0577.mp3|at the risk of displeasing innocent ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0578.mp3|i submit that egoism belongs to the essence of a noble soul|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0580.mp3|and have to sacrifice themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0581.mp3|the noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0582.mp3|and also without consciousness of harshness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0584.mp3|or arbitrariness therein|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0585.mp3|but rather as something that may have its basis in the primary law of things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0587.mp3|he acknowledges under certain circumstances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0588.mp3|which made him hesitate at first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0589.mp3|that there are other equally privileged ones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0590.mp3|as soon as he has settled this question of rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0591.mp3|he moves among those equals and equally privileged ones with the same assurance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0592.mp3|as regards modesty and delicate respect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0593.mp3|which he enjoys in intercourse with himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0594.mp3|in accordance with an innate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0595.mp3|it is an additional instance of his egoism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0596.mp3|this artfulness and self limitation in intercourse with his equals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0597.mp3|every star is a similar egoist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0598.mp3|he honours himself in them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0599.mp3|and in the rights which he concedes to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0601.mp3|as the essence of all intercourse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0602.mp3|belongs also to the natural condition of things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0603.mp3|the noble soul gives as he takes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0604.mp3|prompted by the passionate and sensitive instinct of requital|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0605.mp3|which is at the root of his nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0607.mp3|neither significance nor good repute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0608.mp3|there may be a sublime way of letting gifts as it were light upon one from above|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0610.mp3|but for those arts and displays the noble soul has no aptitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0611.mp3|his egoism hinders him here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0612.mp3|in general he looks aloft unwillingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0613.mp3|he looks either forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0614.mp3|horizontally and deliberately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0615.mp3|or downwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0616.mp3|one can only truly esteem him who does not look out for himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0618.mp3|the chinese have a proverb which mothers even teach their children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0619.mp3|this is the essentially fundamental tendency in latter day civilizations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0620.mp3|i have no doubt that an ancient greek|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0623.mp3|in this respect alone we should immediately be distasteful to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0624.mp3|what after all is ignobleness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0628.mp3|are more or less definite mental symbols for frequently returning and concurring sensations|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_09_nietzsche_0630.mp3|it is not sufficient to use the same words in order to understand one another|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0193.mp3|and conceals the end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0194.mp3|as every means does|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0195.mp3|spoil all intercourse for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0196.mp3|this kind of man is acquainted with solitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0198.mp3|happy chances are necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0199.mp3|and many incalculable elements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0200.mp3|in order that a higher man in whom the solution of a problem is dormant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0201.mp3|may yet take action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0202.mp3|or break forth as one might say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0203.mp3|at the right moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0204.mp3|on an average it does not happen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0205.mp3|and in all corners of the earth there are waiting ones sitting who hardly know to what extent they are waiting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0206.mp3|and still less that they wait in vain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0207.mp3|occasionally too the waking call comes too late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0208.mp3|the chance which gives permission to take action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0210.mp3|and strength for action have been used up in sitting still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0211.mp3|and how many a one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0212.mp3|just as he sprang up has found with horror that his limbs are benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0213.mp3|it is too late he has said to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0214.mp3|and has become self distrustful and henceforth for ever useless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0215.mp3|in the domain of genius|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0216.mp3|may not the raphael without hands taking the expression in its widest sense perhaps not be the exception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0217.mp3|but the rule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0218.mp3|perhaps genius is by no means so rare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0220.mp3|the right time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0221.mp3|in order to take chance by the forelock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0222.mp3|he who does not wish to see the height of a man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0223.mp3|looks all the more sharply at what is low in him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0224.mp3|and in the foreground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0225.mp3|and thereby betrays himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0226.mp3|in all kinds of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul is better off than the nobler soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0227.mp3|the dangers of the latter must be greater|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0228.mp3|the probability that it will come to grief and perish is in fact immense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0229.mp3|considering the multiplicity of the conditions of its existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0230.mp3|in a lizard a finger grows again which has been lost not so in man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0231.mp3|it is too bad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0232.mp3|always the old story|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0233.mp3|when a man has finished building his house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0238.mp3|wanderer who art thou|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0239.mp3|i see thee follow thy path without scorn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0240.mp3|without love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0241.mp3|with unfathomable eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0242.mp3|wet and sad as a plummet which has returned to the light insatiated out of every depth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0243.mp3|what did it seek down there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0244.mp3|with a bosom that never sighs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0245.mp3|with lips that conceal their loathing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0247.mp3|who art thou|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0248.mp3|what hast thou done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0249.mp3|rest thee here this place has hospitality for every one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0250.mp3|refresh thyself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0251.mp3|and whoever thou art what is it that now pleases thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0252.mp3|what will serve to refresh thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0253.mp3|only name it whatever i have i offer thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0254.mp3|to refresh me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0255.mp3|to refresh me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0257.mp3|but give me i pray thee what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0258.mp3|what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0259.mp3|speak out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0260.mp3|another mask|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0261.mp3|a second mask two hundred seventy nine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0262.mp3|men of profound sadness betray themselves when they are happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0263.mp3|they have a mode of seizing upon happiness as though they would choke and strangle it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0264.mp3|out of jealousy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0265.mp3|ah they know only too well that it will flee from them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0267.mp3|bad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0268.mp3|what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0269.mp3|does he not go back yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0270.mp3|but you misunderstand him when you complain about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0272.mp3|will people believe it of me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0273.mp3|but i insist that they believe it of me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0274.mp3|i have always thought very unsatisfactorily of myself and about myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0275.mp3|only in very rare cases|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0276.mp3|only compulsorily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0278.mp3|owing to an unconquerable distrust of the possibility of self knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0280.mp3|this matter of fact is almost the most certain thing i know about myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0281.mp3|there must be a sort of repugnance in me to believe anything definite about myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0282.mp3|is there perhaps some enigma therein|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0283.mp3|probably but fortunately nothing for my own teeth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0284.mp3|perhaps it betrays the species to which i belong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0285.mp3|but not to myself as is sufficiently agreeable to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0286.mp3|but what has happened to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0287.mp3|i do not know he said hesitatingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0288.mp3|perhaps the harpies have flown over my table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0289.mp3|it sometimes happens nowadays that a gentle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0291.mp3|retiring man becomes suddenly mad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0292.mp3|breaks the plates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0293.mp3|upsets the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0296.mp3|and shocks everybody|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0297.mp3|and finally withdraws ashamed and raging at himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0299.mp3|for what purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0301.mp3|to suffocate with his memories|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0302.mp3|to him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0303.mp3|and only seldom finds his table laid and his food prepared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0304.mp3|the danger will always be great|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0305.mp3|nowadays however it is extraordinarily so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0306.mp3|thrown into the midst of a noisy and plebeian age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0307.mp3|with which he does not like to eat out of the same dish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0308.mp3|he may readily perish of hunger and thirst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0310.mp3|we have probably all sat at tables to which we did not belong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0314.mp3|the after dinner nausea two hundred eighty three|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0315.mp3|if one wishes to praise at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0316.mp3|it is a delicate and at the same time a noble self control|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0317.mp3|to praise only where one does not agree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0319.mp3|which is contrary to good taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0321.mp3|to be sure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0322.mp3|which offers excellent opportunity and provocation to constant misunderstanding to be able to allow oneself this veritable luxury of taste and morality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0323.mp3|one must not live among intellectual imbeciles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0324.mp3|but rather among men whose misunderstandings and mistakes amuse by their refinement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0325.mp3|or one will have to pay dearly for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0326.mp3|he praises me therefore he acknowledges me to be right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0328.mp3|for it brings the asses into our neighbourhood and friendship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0330.mp3|to have|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0331.mp3|or not to have|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0332.mp3|one's emotions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0334.mp3|according to choice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0336.mp3|to seat oneself on them as upon horses and often as upon asses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0337.mp3|for one must know how to make use of their stupidity as well as of their fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0338.mp3|to conserve one's three hundred foregrounds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0339.mp3|also one's black spectacles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0340.mp3|for there are circumstances when nobody must look into our eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0341.mp3|still less into our motives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0342.mp3|and to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice politeness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0343.mp3|and to remain master of one's four virtues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0347.mp3|and solitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0348.mp3|for solitude is a virtue with us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0350.mp3|which divines that in the contact of man and man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0351.mp3|in society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0352.mp3|it must be unavoidably impure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0354.mp3|the greatest events and thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0355.mp3|the greatest thoughts however are the greatest events|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0357.mp3|the generations which are contemporary with them do not experience such events|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0358.mp3|they live past them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0360.mp3|the light of the furthest stars is longest in reaching man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0361.mp3|and before it has arrived man denies that there are stars there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0362.mp3|how many centuries does a mind require to be understood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0363.mp3|that is also a standard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0364.mp3|one also makes a gradation of rank and an etiquette therewith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0365.mp3|such as is necessary for mind and for star|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0366.mp3|here is the prospect free the mind exalted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0367.mp3|but there is a reverse kind of man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0368.mp3|who is also upon a height|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0369.mp3|and has also a free prospect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0370.mp3|but looks downwards two hundred eighty seven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0371.mp3|what is noble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0372.mp3|what does the word noble still mean for us nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0374.mp3|how is he recognized under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0376.mp3|it is not his actions which establish his claim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0377.mp3|actions are always ambiguous always inscrutable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0378.mp3|neither is it his works|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0379.mp3|one finds nowadays among artists and scholars plenty of those who betray by their works that a profound longing for nobleness impels them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0380.mp3|but this very need of nobleness is radically different from the needs of the noble soul itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0381.mp3|and is in fact the eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0383.mp3|but the belief which is here decisive and determines the order of rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0384.mp3|to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper meaning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0385.mp3|it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0386.mp3|something which is not to be sought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0387.mp3|is not to be found|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0388.mp3|and perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0390.mp3|is not to be lost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0392.mp3|let them turn and twist themselves as they will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0393.mp3|and hold their hands before their treacherous eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0394.mp3|as though the hand were not a betrayer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0395.mp3|it always comes out at last that they have something which they hide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0396.mp3|namely intellect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0397.mp3|one of the subtlest means of deceiving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0398.mp3|at least as long as possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0399.mp3|and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider than one really is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0400.mp3|which in everyday life is often as desirable as an umbrella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0401.mp3|is called enthusiasm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0402.mp3|including what belongs to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0407.mp3|something of the murmuring tones and timid vigilance of solitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0408.mp3|in his strongest words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0409.mp3|even in his cry itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0411.mp3|of concealment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0412.mp3|he who has sat day and night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0413.mp3|from year's end to year's end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0414.mp3|alone with his soul in familiar discord and discourse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0415.mp3|he who has become a cave bear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0416.mp3|or a treasure seeker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0418.mp3|it may be a labyrinth but can also be a gold mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0419.mp3|his ideas themselves eventually acquire a twilight colour of their own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0421.mp3|as much of the depth as of the mould|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0422.mp3|something uncommunicative and repulsive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0423.mp3|which blows chilly upon every passer by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0424.mp3|the recluse does not believe that a philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0425.mp3|supposing that a philosopher has always in the first place been a recluse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0426.mp3|ever expressed his actual and ultimate opinions in books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0427.mp3|are not books written precisely to hide what is in us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0429.mp3|he will doubt whether a philosopher can have ultimate and actual opinions at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0430.mp3|whether behind every cave in him there is not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0431.mp3|and must necessarily be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0432.mp3|a still deeper cave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0433.mp3|an ampler|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0435.mp3|richer world beyond the surface|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0436.mp3|an abyss behind every bottom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0437.mp3|beneath every foundation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0438.mp3|every philosophy is a foreground philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0440.mp3|there is something arbitrary in the fact that the philosopher came to a stand here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0441.mp3|took a retrospect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0442.mp3|and looked around|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0443.mp3|that he here laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0444.mp3|there is also something suspicious in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0445.mp3|every philosophy also conceals a philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0446.mp3|every opinion is also a lurking place every word is also a mask two hundred ninety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0447.mp3|every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being misunderstood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0448.mp3|the latter perhaps wounds his vanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0449.mp3|but the former wounds his heart his sympathy which always says|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0450.mp3|ah why would you also have as hard a time of it as i have two hundred ninety one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0456.mp3|uncanny to the other animals by his artifice and sagacity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0457.mp3|rather than by his strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0458.mp3|has invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his soul as something simple|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0459.mp3|and the whole of morality is a long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0460.mp3|audacious falsification|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0461.mp3|by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of the soul becomes possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0462.mp3|from this point of view there is perhaps much more in the conception of art than is generally believed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0463.mp3|a philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0464.mp3|that is a man who constantly experiences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0469.mp3|and dreams extraordinary things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0470.mp3|who is struck by his own thoughts as if they came from the outside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0471.mp3|from above and below|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0472.mp3|as a species of events and lightning flashes peculiar to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0473.mp3|who is perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightnings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0474.mp3|a portentous man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0475.mp3|around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and something uncanny going on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0476.mp3|a philosopher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0478.mp3|a being who often runs away from himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0479.mp3|is often afraid of himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0480.mp3|but whose curiosity always makes him come to himself again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0481.mp3|a man who says|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0483.mp3|i take it for my own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0484.mp3|and mean to guard and protect it from every one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0485.mp3|a man who can conduct a case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0486.mp3|carry out a resolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0487.mp3|remain true to an opinion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0488.mp3|keep hold of a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0489.mp3|punish and overthrow insolence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0490.mp3|a man who has his indignation and his sword|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0491.mp3|and to whom the weak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0492.mp3|the suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0494.mp3|and even the animals willingly submit and naturally belong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0495.mp3|in short a man who is a master by nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0496.mp3|when such a man has sympathy well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0497.mp3|that sympathy has value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0498.mp3|but of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0499.mp3|or of those even who preach sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0500.mp3|there is nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0501.mp3|throughout almost the whole of europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0502.mp3|a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0506.mp3|with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0507.mp3|seeks to deck itself out as something superior|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0508.mp3|there is a regular cult of suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0509.mp3|the unmanliness of that which is called sympathy by such groups of visionaries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0512.mp3|the first thing that strikes the eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0513.mp3|one must resolutely and radically taboo this latest form of bad taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0514.mp3|and finally i wish people to put the good amulet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0516.mp3|on heart and neck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0518.mp3|despite the philosopher who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0519.mp3|as a genuine englishman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0520.mp3|tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking minds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0521.mp3|laughing is a bad infirmity of human nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0523.mp3|i would even allow myself to rank philosophers according to the quality of their laughing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0524.mp3|up to those who are capable of golden laughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0526.mp3|which i am strongly inclined to believe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0527.mp3|owing to many reasons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0528.mp3|i have no doubt that they also know how to laugh thereby in an overman like and new fashion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0529.mp3|and at the expense of all serious things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0530.mp3|gods are fond of ridicule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0531.mp3|it seems that they cannot refrain from laughter even in holy matters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0532.mp3|the genius of the heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0533.mp3|as that great mysterious one possesses it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0535.mp3|whose voice can descend into the nether world of every soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0536.mp3|who neither speaks a word nor casts a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch of allurement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0537.mp3|to whose perfection it pertains that he knows how to appear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0538.mp3|not as he is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0539.mp3|but in a guise which acts as an additional constraint on his followers to press ever closer to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0540.mp3|to follow him more cordially and thoroughly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0541.mp3|the genius of the heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0542.mp3|which imposes silence and attention on everything loud and self conceited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0544.mp3|to lie placid as a mirror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0545.mp3|that the deep heavens may be reflected in them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0546.mp3|the genius of the heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0547.mp3|which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0548.mp3|and to grasp more delicately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0551.mp3|and is a divining rod for every grain of gold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0552.mp3|long buried and imprisoned in mud and sand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0553.mp3|the genius of the heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0554.mp3|from contact with which every one goes away richer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0555.mp3|not favoured or surprised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0557.mp3|but richer in himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0558.mp3|newer than before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0559.mp3|broken up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0562.mp3|more uncertain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0564.mp3|more delicate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0565.mp3|more fragile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0566.mp3|more bruised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0567.mp3|but full of hopes which as yet lack names|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0568.mp3|full of a new will and current|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0569.mp3|full of a new ill will and counter current|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0570.mp3|but what am i doing my friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0571.mp3|of whom am i talking to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0572.mp3|have i forgotten myself so far that i have not even told you his name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0573.mp3|unless it be that you have already divined of your own accord who this questionable god and spirit is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0574.mp3|that wishes to be praised in such a manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0576.mp3|as it happens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on his legs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0577.mp3|and in foreign lands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0578.mp3|i have also encountered on my path many strange and dangerous spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0581.mp3|and again and again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0582.mp3|the one of whom i have just spoken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0583.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0586.mp3|to whom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0587.mp3|as you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0588.mp3|i once offered in all secrecy and reverence my first fruits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0589.mp3|the last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0590.mp3|as it seems to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0591.mp3|who has offered a sacrifice to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0592.mp3|for i have found no one who could understand what i was then doing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0593.mp3|in the meantime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0594.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0595.mp3|i have learned much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0596.mp3|far too much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0597.mp3|about the philosophy of this god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0599.mp3|as i said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0600.mp3|from mouth to mouth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0604.mp3|as far as i am allowed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0605.mp3|a little taste of this philosophy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0606.mp3|in a hushed voice as is but seemly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0607.mp3|for it has to do with much that is secret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0611.mp3|and uncanny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0618.mp3|there is less to be said against it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0619.mp3|except that it comes too late and not at the right time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0621.mp3|as it has been disclosed to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0625.mp3|that in the frankness of my story i must go further than is agreeable to the strict usages of your ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0626.mp3|certainly the god in question went further|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0627.mp3|very much further|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0628.mp3|in such dialogues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0629.mp3|and was always many paces ahead of me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0630.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0631.mp3|if it were allowed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0632.mp3|i should have to give him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0633.mp3|according to human usage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0635.mp3|i should have to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0636.mp3|his fearless honesty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0638.mp3|and love of wisdom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0639.mp3|but such a god does not know what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0640.mp3|keep that he would say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0641.mp3|for thyself and those like thee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0642.mp3|and whoever else require it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0643.mp3|have no reason to cover my nakedness one suspects that this kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0644.mp3|he once said under certain circumstances i love mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0645.mp3|and referred thereby to ariadne who was present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0648.mp3|inventive animal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0649.mp3|that has not his equal upon earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0650.mp3|he makes his way even through all labyrinths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0651.mp3|i like man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0652.mp3|and often think how i can still further advance him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0653.mp3|and make him stronger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0655.mp3|and more profound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0656.mp3|stronger more evil and more profound i asked in horror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0657.mp3|yes he said again stronger more evil and more profound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0658.mp3|also more beautiful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0660.mp3|as though he had just paid some charming compliment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0661.mp3|one here sees at once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0662.mp3|and in general there are good grounds for supposing that in some things the gods could all of them come to us men for instruction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0663.mp3|we men are more human|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0665.mp3|what are you after all my written and painted thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0667.mp3|young and malicious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0668.mp3|so full of thorns and secret spices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0669.mp3|that you made me sneeze and laugh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0670.mp3|and now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0671.mp3|you have already doffed your novelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0672.mp3|and some of you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0674.mp3|are ready to become truths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0676.mp3|so pathetically honest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0677.mp3|so tedious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0678.mp3|and was it ever otherwise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0679.mp3|what then do we write and paint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0680.mp3|we mandarins with chinese brush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0682.mp3|what are we alone capable of painting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0684.mp3|only that which is just about to fade and begins to lose its odour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0686.mp3|only exhausted and departing storms and belated yellow sentiments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0688.mp3|only birds strayed and fatigued by flight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0689.mp3|which now let themselves be captured with the hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0690.mp3|with our hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0692.mp3|things only which are exhausted and mellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0693.mp3|and it is only for your afternoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0695.mp3|my written and painted thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0698.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0699.mp3|many variegated softenings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0700.mp3|and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0701.mp3|but nobody will divine thereby how ye looked in your morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0702.mp3|you sudden sparks and marvels of my solitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/13594/beyondgoodandevil_10_nietzsche_0706.mp3|evil thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0007.mp3|the glint of straws blown from horses feeds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0010.mp3|the blaze of gold lettering along the house fronts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0011.mp3|the slight quiver of the nerves after a momentarily dangerous crossing accentuating the perception is that london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0012.mp3|does that rise up in your londoner's mind's eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0016.mp3|he thinks of his own places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0018.mp3|like that of baggage wagons huddled together after a great defeat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0019.mp3|blocked in the narrow ways of the city|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0022.mp3|of buses drawing out of line|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0023.mp3|of sticky mud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0024.mp3|with a pallid church wavering into invisibility towards the steeple in the weeping sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0026.mp3|of half the street up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0027.mp3|of the monstrous figure of a horse down and surely there is no more monstrous apparition than that of a horse down in the sticky streets with its frantic struggles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0028.mp3|the glancing off of its hoofs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0029.mp3|the roll of eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0030.mp3|the sudden apparition of great teeth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0031.mp3|and then its lying still is this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0035.mp3|the london we see from a distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0036.mp3|or do we see it in the glare of kerosene lamps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0037.mp3|the diffused blaze of shop fronts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0038.mp3|the slowly moving faces revealed for a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0039.mp3|then as it were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0042.mp3|marketing crowds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0043.mp3|they will be carrying string bags|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0044.mp3|carrying paper parcels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0047.mp3|treading on the white scrolls of orange peels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0048.mp3|on small heaps of muddy sawdust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0053.mp3|peals of notes of barrel organs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0054.mp3|in a patch of shadow left in a vacant space|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0055.mp3|you will hardly make out the figure of a forlorn man standing still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0057.mp3|announcing one of the ills of the flesh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0058.mp3|he offers for sale things that you would think nobody could stop to buy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0061.mp3|almost assuredly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0063.mp3|we seeing things with the eye of a bird that is close to the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0064.mp3|and with the eye of a bird seeking for minute fragments of seed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0065.mp3|minute insects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0066.mp3|tiny parasites|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0069.mp3|as nothing but the architectural arrangements of translucent gin bottles in pale shop windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0071.mp3|the essential bohemian must think of those whose sign visual is the aligned brass knockers of suburban streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0074.mp3|humanity not caring to think about what it does not like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0076.mp3|the working man thinks of high streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0077.mp3|of small streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0078.mp3|of tenement blocks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0080.mp3|the limits of the classes are not of course so crudely definite but that there is an infinity of individual variants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0081.mp3|there are the crowds of philanthropists who make swallow flights into slums|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0082.mp3|the mechanics who dream of their own carriages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0083.mp3|there is room for millennialists who strive to create garden cities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0085.mp3|but in the bulk the londoner is anything rather than tolerant of a class not his own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0086.mp3|the unfamiliar is almost inevitably the iniquitous we may|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0087.mp3|among the october partridges|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0088.mp3|have a sudden vision of a slinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0089.mp3|horribly suggestive pair of figures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0090.mp3|we saw them as we walked gaily home from the very best ball of last season|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0091.mp3|in the pale delicate stillness of dawn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0092.mp3|at the mouth of a black court|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0093.mp3|under the unclean light of a street lamp held out from a dirty wall by a bracket|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0116.mp3|a man may have passed right across london in his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0117.mp3|he may have dropped as it were from ledge to ledge|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0125.mp3|not the shabby lodgings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0126.mp3|not the dismal blind yard in which sandwich boards are given out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0127.mp3|not any of the intermediate stages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0128.mp3|but the west of his youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0131.mp3|the inscriptions in the kosher shops|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0147.mp3|an unemotional mind and a great sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0149.mp3|and an immense knowledge|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0151.mp3|of other cities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0152.mp3|he must have an avidity and a sobriety of intellect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0153.mp3|an untirable physique and a delicately tempered mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0155.mp3|an intelligent foreigner running through a town of strongly marked features may carry away a definite impression of its character and its life|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0209.mp3|he has a hazy notion that no one in london need die of starvation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0210.mp3|seeing that there are workhouses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0211.mp3|but as a rule he knows nothing of the workings of poor law relief|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0214.mp3|as a result|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0215.mp3|have added to his particular picture of the place|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0222.mp3|the suggestion of a naked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0225.mp3|but an intangible cloud like population of white faced misery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0226.mp3|may come suddenly to disturb his ideas of hoxton or highgate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0230.mp3|the profusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0232.mp3|of a foreign view of hyde park|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0233.mp3|in front of the dark eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0234.mp3|the flashing teeth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0235.mp3|the blue blouse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0236.mp3|he will grow uncomfortably uncertain whether|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0240.mp3|catch hold of with his hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0241.mp3|he knows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0243.mp3|so appallingly little of his london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0244.mp3|it isn't his business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0251.mp3|they have not any corporate spirit in particular|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0252.mp3|and the londoner when talked to by inhabitants of other considerable towns is apt to be violently confronted with what he hasn't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0255.mp3|but nearer home he will learn more severe lessons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0256.mp3|let him go to one of the larger towns well outside his home counties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0257.mp3|and he will have it forced in on him that he has no municipal buildings costing well nigh a million|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0259.mp3|that his atmosphere has not half the corrosive properties that it should have to betoken the last word of wealth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0260.mp3|of progress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0261.mp3|and of commercial energy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0262.mp3|he will be told that he has nothing worth having|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0263.mp3|and that he is infinitely too proud of what he has|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0264.mp3|yet as a rule the accusation is unkind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0265.mp3|however proud the londoner may be of his personality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0267.mp3|of his wine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0270.mp3|his most considerable exhibition of pride will appear in his mild disgust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0271.mp3|if he is mistaken for a provincial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0272.mp3|he is singularly useless as a defender of the city's fame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0273.mp3|he will know of a mansion house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0274.mp3|but he will probably not know whether it is a municipal place of business or merely the residence of a chief magistrate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0275.mp3|he will have a vague idea that something goes on at spring gardens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0277.mp3|on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0278.mp3|be certain whether london contained a university|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0280.mp3|tucked away in some corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0282.mp3|or very good postal directories|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0285.mp3|his eyes will have told him that that is not the case to day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0286.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0287.mp3|set there in the hideous heart of the german competition he so much dreads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0288.mp3|confronted by the blackened landscape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0290.mp3|by horizons obscured with rusty cinder heaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0291.mp3|by heaps of sand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0293.mp3|of red|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0296.mp3|by dirt of the foulest and labour of the obviously grimmest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0300.mp3|he has factories larger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0303.mp3|more solvent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0304.mp3|and a landscape more blackened and more grim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0305.mp3|the westphalian will say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0309.mp3|and an old gray horse cropping the grass between the flagstones of threadneedle street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0310.mp3|he will not in the least know what reserves of wealth or of energy his london may have|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0312.mp3|his intimate london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0313.mp3|will be the little bits of it that witnessed the great moments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0314.mp3|the poignant moods of his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0315.mp3|it will be what happened to be the backgrounds of his more intense emotions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0316.mp3|certain corners of streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0318.mp3|certain cloud forms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0319.mp3|gusts of white smoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0321.mp3|familiar sounds these|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0322.mp3|in their remembrance will wring his heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0323.mp3|he will have noticed them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0324.mp3|or hardly noticed them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0325.mp3|glancing aside in his moments of terror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0326.mp3|of perplexity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0327.mp3|of passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0329.mp3|and the remembrance of them|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0331.mp3|will bring up again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0332.mp3|tempered by the glamour of memory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0333.mp3|by the romance of old days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0334.mp3|the reflection of those griefs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0335.mp3|of those terrors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0336.mp3|of those old piteousnesses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0337.mp3|for london is before all things an incomparable background|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0338.mp3|it is always in the right note|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0344.mp3|he may have received a moment before the first embrace of a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0345.mp3|or a moment before his doctor may have told him that he is not very long for this world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0346.mp3|he will stand looking down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0347.mp3|and a sudden consonance with his mood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0348.mp3|of overwhelming and hardly comprehensible joy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0351.mp3|in the long wavering reflections on the gleaming paving stones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0352.mp3|in the engrossed hurry of the passer by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0353.mp3|it will become|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0354.mp3|intimately and rightly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0355.mp3|the appropriate background for a beginning of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0356.mp3|or for a farewell from life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0357.mp3|for the glow of a commenced love or for the dull pain of a malady ending only in death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0358.mp3|it is that more than anything that london has ready for every man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0359.mp3|it can provide a background for everything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0360.mp3|with the sympathy of the weeping heavens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0362.mp3|it remains always a background|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0363.mp3|it never obtrudes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0364.mp3|a man may be so soothingly alone with his joys as with his griefs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0365.mp3|we may hurry across the great stretches and folds of a park|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0366.mp3|with a glamorous smirched sunset|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0367.mp3|curling clouds over the distant houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0368.mp3|wisps of mist becoming palpably blue against thorn trees and the call of a closing space and of a closing in day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0369.mp3|indescribably mournful and distant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0370.mp3|we may hurry to our triumph of love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0371.mp3|to our bankruptcy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0372.mp3|to our end or our beginning of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0376.mp3|to a house where there are the titter and bustle of a wedding|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0377.mp3|or where on the stairs there are the heavy footfalls and muffled breathings of men carrying down the coffin of our best friend in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0378.mp3|the background for either mood will be the right one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0380.mp3|i have known a man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0381.mp3|dying a long way from london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0382.mp3|sigh queerly for a sight of the gush of smoke that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0383.mp3|on a platform of the underground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0388.mp3|into the dim upper light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0389.mp3|he wanted to see it again as others have wished to see once more the bay of naples|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0390.mp3|the olive groves of catania|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0392.mp3|the odd top hatted unpresentable figure of a battered man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0393.mp3|holding a paper of bun crumbs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0394.mp3|with pigeons on his shoulders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0395.mp3|on his hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0397.mp3|london is a thing of these bits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0398.mp3|it is seldom that one sees at one time as much of it as one may always see of any country town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0399.mp3|it has nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0400.mp3|it never had anything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0401.mp3|worth talking of as a spectacular expression of humanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0402.mp3|of that incongruous jumble of races that is in england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0405.mp3|the tombs of its kings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0409.mp3|relatively to london nowhere in particular|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0410.mp3|viewed from a distance it is a cloud on the horizon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0412.mp3|further side of the surrey hills at night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0414.mp3|of pine tops|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0415.mp3|of elms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0416.mp3|one may see on the sky a brooding and sinister glow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_02_ford_0417.mp3|that is london manifesting itself on the clouds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0001.mp3|i can scarcely tell even where that is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0002.mp3|i have heard that it can be seen from near colchester|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0003.mp3|from near maidstone i have seen it myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0006.mp3|speaking a little arbitrarily we may say that there are three londons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0007.mp3|there is the psychological london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0008.mp3|where the london spirit is the note of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0009.mp3|there is the administrative county|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0010.mp3|and there is the london of natural causes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0012.mp3|assembly of houses in the basin of the lower thames|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0013.mp3|to where then do the spheres of influence of these three londons reach out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0015.mp3|i do not know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0016.mp3|and i have asked myself the question many times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0017.mp3|the administrative county includes so little of psychological london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0020.mp3|in their own ways|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0025.mp3|and half of the essex flats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0029.mp3|because the greater part of its inhabitants get their supplies from the stores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0030.mp3|and go for their intellectual stimulants to a place in oxford street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0032.mp3|i heard the other day from an administrator of those parts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0033.mp3|he was living in ruined temples|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0034.mp3|but his clothes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0039.mp3|his mustard and his wines came from the one institution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0040.mp3|he was astonishingly well up in the books of the year|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0041.mp3|better certainly than most london reviewers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0042.mp3|because of the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0047.mp3|these ruined temples where he camped for the night became little pieces of london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0053.mp3|and newer families imitate them for sentimental or for social reasons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0054.mp3|in poorer neighbourhoods this is much more the case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0055.mp3|old places of entertainment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0056.mp3|like the horns assembly rooms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0058.mp3|and large theatres spring up along the tram lines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0059.mp3|i think there are no local daily papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0060.mp3|though in the dark heart of the docks knots of men stand round blank walls on these journalists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0061.mp3|having the same relation to those of fleet street as the pavement artist has to academicians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0062.mp3|chalk in capital letters details of the last murders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0064.mp3|and wrecks and the people of the poorer suburbs do their shopping in their own high streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0068.mp3|limit psychological london by the glow on its sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0069.mp3|to the sphere of influence of the stores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0070.mp3|or to the administrative county|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0073.mp3|ignores alike the psychological and the natural|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0075.mp3|the sewers of slums and great expanses of green land the natural features of london are obscured but they underlie the others patiently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0076.mp3|they are the hills that made possible the basin of the thames|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0078.mp3|they are the old marshes and flat lands on which it was so easy to build|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0079.mp3|they show still a little in open hilly spaces of the outlying ring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0080.mp3|in odd bits of forest here and there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0081.mp3|in level commons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0083.mp3|where there are still many ponds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0084.mp3|no doubt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0085.mp3|in the ultimate fullness of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0088.mp3|and marshes will resume their sway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0089.mp3|but nowadays we may say that london begins where tree trunks commence to be black|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0091.mp3|or wimbledon from norwich|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0092.mp3|this tree trunk boundary is however defective enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0093.mp3|in many parts of epping the wood is so dense that boughs and boulders are as green|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0094.mp3|as brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0098.mp3|the zone of blackened trunks extends further than is fair towards the north and the east|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0099.mp3|but judged by this standard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0101.mp3|as far as i have been able to observe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0106.mp3|to the west of brentford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0107.mp3|the southwest of barnes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0109.mp3|well to the east of bromley|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0113.mp3|find this tree trunk limitation a little faulty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0115.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0116.mp3|as the invariable and bewildering exception to this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0118.mp3|it may as well be set down that the most londony of all london trees has a bark that is never uniformly black|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0120.mp3|because it sheds its bark continually|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0122.mp3|if i may be allowed an image that appears frivolous but that is sober enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0123.mp3|a perpetual emblem to the city of the morning tub|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0125.mp3|in the parks to the thorn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0126.mp3|but it is the tree of intimate london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0132.mp3|and how many other elms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0133.mp3|greet us on the run into town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0134.mp3|and the feathery outlines of how many of these trees close the vistas of those new suburban streets that are for ever drilling little pathways into the ancient estates of the home counties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0136.mp3|elms standing on rising ground have formed familiar landmarks for twenty centuries before there were beacons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0139.mp3|or pilots on the river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0140.mp3|for the question of london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0141.mp3|seen from one point of view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0142.mp3|resolves itself into that one of highways|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0143.mp3|and the very origin of london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0144.mp3|the first cause of its existence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0145.mp3|is that waterway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0146.mp3|nowadays we have discovered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0147.mp3|as if in the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0148.mp3|a new secret of rapid communication|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0150.mp3|as with every previous modification of the kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0151.mp3|the face of london bids fair to change unrecognisably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0154.mp3|towards richmond|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0155.mp3|and towards kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0156.mp3|and on its other bounds towards how many other outlying places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0157.mp3|the electric tram is doing all this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0158.mp3|to come into a city by means of one of these new|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0159.mp3|swift carriages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0160.mp3|to come from any distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0161.mp3|say by a motor car|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0162.mp3|is to fly too fast for any easy recognition of the gradual changes from country to town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0163.mp3|there are hedgerows|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0200.mp3|a sort of nightmare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0201.mp3|but the motorist is too low down as a rule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0202.mp3|the air presses against the eyes and half closes them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0203.mp3|he has a tendency to look forward along the road|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0204.mp3|to see more of vehicles and of pedestrians than of the actual country or the regiments of buildings he grows a little aloof|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0207.mp3|of getting used to it or of thinking of distances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0209.mp3|in terms of the motor car|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0228.mp3|the speed is not so great|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0229.mp3|and you have not the least anxiety as to what it may choose to run into|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0230.mp3|if you want to see things you are at a greater height|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0231.mp3|your range of sight is much longer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0232.mp3|you may pick out upon the pavement any strange object|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0236.mp3|winkles out of a blue paper bag or a girl with extremely brilliant red hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0237.mp3|you pick them out from a distance and watch them for a minute or two|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0239.mp3|the other day i saw from the top of an electric tram|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0240.mp3|very far away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0241.mp3|above the converging lines in the perspective of a broad highway of new shops|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0243.mp3|the thin arm stretched out above the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0247.mp3|turning slowly in mid air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0249.mp3|a puff of smoke shot out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0250.mp3|writhed very white|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0254.mp3|the thin extended arm of the crane a little more foreshortened against the haze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0255.mp3|then the outlines grew tremulous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0256.mp3|it all vanished with a touch of that pathos like a hunger that attaches to all things of which we see the beginnings or the middle courses without knowing the ends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0257.mp3|it was impressive enough the modern spirit expressing itself in terms not of men but of forces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0258.mp3|we gliding by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0259.mp3|the timbers swinging up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0260.mp3|without any visible human action in either motion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0261.mp3|no doubt men were at work in the engine belly of the crane|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0262.mp3|just as others were very far away among the dynamos that kept us moving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0263.mp3|but they were sweating invisible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0264.mp3|that too is the modern spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0267.mp3|and to all appearances infallible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0271.mp3|these electric trams appear romantic and a little wonderful gongs sound at their approach rather plaintively|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0274.mp3|mellow flood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0275.mp3|a reflection is cast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0276.mp3|dim and flying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0277.mp3|upon old black houses behind trees and upon the large|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0282.mp3|the clang of the gongs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0283.mp3|the rumble growing and dying away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0284.mp3|the strong lights|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0285.mp3|the momentary and half revealed details of the darkened buildings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0286.mp3|the thought of all these people going out a long way to sleep in the blacker darkness have about them something touching and romantic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0287.mp3|something characteristic and foreign|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0288.mp3|of the older methods of communication i suppose the bicycle to come next|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0289.mp3|but i have always found entering london in this way to be tedious and dispiriting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0290.mp3|you have to attend to yourself even more particularly than when you are in a motor car|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0291.mp3|you have only half a horizon the half that is in front of you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0292.mp3|you are nearer the dust when there is dust or nearer the mud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0293.mp3|transition from country to town becomes rather wearisome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0294.mp3|you think a good deal in miles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0295.mp3|london manifests itself slowly with high banked and gravelled footpaths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0296.mp3|with those same blackened tree trunks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0297.mp3|in a certain coarseness of the grass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0298.mp3|in houses of call that you feel uninclined to call at|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0300.mp3|indefinably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0301.mp3|you don't know why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0305.mp3|all sorts of hamlets with kingston on thames|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0310.mp3|others look like the station omnibuses of country hotels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0311.mp3|their existence is largely unsuspected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0315.mp3|it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0316.mp3|as a rule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0317.mp3|bright green|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0319.mp3|it goes at a good pace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0320.mp3|and it is the sign that you have reached the sphere of influence of the very outer suburbs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0321.mp3|i at least have never entered london by road without meeting or passing one of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0323.mp3|they are the signs of london's reaching out its arms still further|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0325.mp3|in older days they started from whitehall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0326.mp3|from the bank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0327.mp3|from the borough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0328.mp3|and were called short stages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0329.mp3|as real london spreads they cease to pay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0330.mp3|they travel farther afield|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_03_ford_0331.mp3|and their place is taken by our municipal services or by those of the larger trusts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0000.mp3|it is a long time since i have come into london on foot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0001.mp3|so long that i have forgotten what it feels like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0003.mp3|i fancy that the proceeding is no longer modern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0004.mp3|and is in consequence illegitimate to my purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0007.mp3|and the gipsies who walk beside basket caravans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0011.mp3|it is not very usual to meet them in inner london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0012.mp3|though i have seen two or three at a time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0013.mp3|with their chimneys smoking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0016.mp3|because it was towards the end of may|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0017.mp3|but except when there is some such reason for haste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0018.mp3|these caravans rarely cross london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0019.mp3|they circle it by the roads just inside the suburbs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0020.mp3|only yesterday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0021.mp3|about six miles from whitehall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0024.mp3|i glanced down it walking outwards it was empty silent and sordid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0027.mp3|eight or nine dark women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0028.mp3|and several children with black or red heads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0029.mp3|in four or five of the small new streets that ran at right angles to my road there were caravans covered with basket chairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0031.mp3|wicker baskets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0032.mp3|women were holding these things up in front of the lace curtains of sitting room windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0033.mp3|these people are not mere picturesque survivals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0038.mp3|that looking at things through the small square of a back window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0039.mp3|being at home in the middle of strange things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0041.mp3|one would become more or less of a foreign observer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0042.mp3|that attitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0043.mp3|backed up by that sense of being at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0044.mp3|is the worst that one could assume|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0045.mp3|it kills even tolerance for the habits of others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0048.mp3|reaching his london in a pullman car|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0050.mp3|very much like one of his own hotels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0051.mp3|not very much unlike his own home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0053.mp3|he steps down from it in the dim light of charing cross|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0054.mp3|he has gone through none of the processes of travel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0055.mp3|none of his edges have been rubbed off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0056.mp3|he is not necessarily the best type of russian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0057.mp3|he is quite ready to kick a porter and be cursed for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0059.mp3|and records his hasty impressions in letters home that may become so many international causes of misunderstanding in the slower days it was different he was sent abroad because he was the best type of his race|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0062.mp3|on foot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0063.mp3|by ship to hull|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0064.mp3|overland to london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0065.mp3|he had plenty of preparation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0066.mp3|plenty of hardship to rub the angles down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0067.mp3|and he was very glad to reach his journey's end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0069.mp3|he reported well of the place he had reached|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0070.mp3|if an ambassador he was polished cosmopolitan and pleasing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0072.mp3|he was a fine spirit he had all sorts of tales to tell of escapes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0073.mp3|of strange things seen by the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0074.mp3|he became a delightful person|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0075.mp3|he was full of deference for local customs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0076.mp3|because his life or his livelihood depended on his ability to please|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0080.mp3|stable boys and hangers on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0081.mp3|or one may evidence casanova|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0082.mp3|who was pleased and pleased himself in london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0083.mp3|or you may read in mister round's commune of london how great a part in the twelfth century foreign merchants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0084.mp3|cut off from their own lands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0085.mp3|played in exacting from the angevin kings the liberty of london herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0086.mp3|it was the same with those whom london sent out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0087.mp3|the few the gentlemen and the merchant adventurers went|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0089.mp3|to the spice islands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0090.mp3|the hardships of a long voyage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0091.mp3|the great mysteries of seas and skies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0093.mp3|they went among strange peoples with minds ready to be delighted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0095.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0096.mp3|nothing more romantic than pepper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0099.mp3|they had left their homes so far behind them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0100.mp3|and this indeed is the defect of the quality of rapid travel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0101.mp3|the londoner abroad is no longer sought after|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0103.mp3|a messenger of the goodness of his race|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0104.mp3|as were congreve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0109.mp3|richardson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0110.mp3|nowadays in the flood of him he has become the tweed suited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0111.mp3|long toothed being of caricatures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0112.mp3|the defect of the quality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0113.mp3|because the traveller now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0115.mp3|takes his home and his home spirit so much with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0116.mp3|and the one and the other are apt to find that every man's hand is against him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0117.mp3|yet if that be the defect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0118.mp3|the product of the quality of rapid transit is london itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0119.mp3|france has its ministry of roads and bridges|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0120.mp3|and that is probably why paris is not france|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0121.mp3|we have none and london is england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0122.mp3|it began by london's settling on the best placed highway in europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0123.mp3|and england is still very much tied to the thames|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0126.mp3|paris has been merely the administrative city|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0127.mp3|in england administration has remained with fair constancy at westminster|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0128.mp3|near enough to the centre of the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0129.mp3|wealth has always come into england by the thames at london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0130.mp3|at any rate in later centuries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0131.mp3|the tendency has been for the administration to settle near the centres of wealth and the combined attractions have made the tract of marsh and flat ground in the lower basin of the river the centre of the arts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0132.mp3|of the industries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0137.mp3|as in the days of john or during the wars of the roses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0140.mp3|but to the end of his reign had practically no administrative power over england at large|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0142.mp3|save in the home counties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0150.mp3|that in fact was the personal influence of london wealth on the country at large|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0151.mp3|and from that day forth it has seemed more and more impossible that a parliament should be held anywhere but in london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0154.mp3|they remain both the question and the cause of that question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0160.mp3|the old question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0161.mp3|and just as to day the alternative to rapid transit is the erecting of tall buildings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0162.mp3|so it was in the old days for ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0163.mp3|the story has been the same down to the minute details|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0168.mp3|till the middle of the seventeenth century|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0169.mp3|then suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0177.mp3|of railway engineers on the day after|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0181.mp3|its roads mere footpaths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0182.mp3|its space circumscribed enough as the town grew more important feudal nobles built palaces on the banks of the stream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0183.mp3|crowds vast for their day came on foot or horse from the surrounding country or in ships from outer europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0186.mp3|climbing up to six|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0189.mp3|near the river were these houses of the comfortable classes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0196.mp3|the comfortable classes built themselves small houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0199.mp3|exactly the same thing has happened with every subsequent improvement in communications|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0200.mp3|ten years ago tall flats for the comfortable and tall dwellings for workmen seemed to have solved the question|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0201.mp3|the latter are already discredited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0202.mp3|the former have always been disliked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0204.mp3|we may consider that the thousands and thousands of small brick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0207.mp3|though still growing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0208.mp3|are old fashioned already|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0209.mp3|so quickly do we move|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0210.mp3|the electric tractions are|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0213.mp3|london is full of traces of these past stages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0215.mp3|somerset house and whitehall and westminster palaces remain administrative long after kings and protectors have left the lower river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0217.mp3|or by firm upon firm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0218.mp3|in stages one above another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0219.mp3|of solicitors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0220.mp3|of architects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0221.mp3|of money lenders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0222.mp3|of journalists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0223.mp3|varying types of houses are buried in all parts of london in a way that is bewildering and makes classification impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0225.mp3|rome and london alike|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0228.mp3|which in any city less prodigal of relics would be a place of pilgrimage for sightseers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0230.mp3|these are not factors in the life of modern london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0232.mp3|shadowed by old trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0234.mp3|jostled by the newest of shops dwelt in by generations as new|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0237.mp3|black or red trams waiting for you in a very narrow square of old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0238.mp3|but not ancient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0243.mp3|slate roofed houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0244.mp3|with bow windows to suggest a certain superiority|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0245.mp3|run at right angles to the highway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0247.mp3|as the tram advances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0248.mp3|each moving vista ending in the screen of distant trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0249.mp3|suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0250.mp3|on the highroad itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0251.mp3|there is a long block of buildings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0253.mp3|and with green shutters above|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0255.mp3|slate roofed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0256.mp3|rather startling and rather impressive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0257.mp3|a high paling and a few tall elms still on the road line|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0261.mp3|till the other day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0262.mp3|an old estate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0266.mp3|what shall be the defects of their qualities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0268.mp3|with the revolution of her wheel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0269.mp3|will bring to light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0270.mp3|perhaps the county council will be forced to play the part of the squire of country villages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0272.mp3|and the faces of their children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0274.mp3|but for the moment these houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0275.mp3|empty still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0276.mp3|clean still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0277.mp3|and standing on a green field|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0280.mp3|as i have said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0281.mp3|impressive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0283.mp3|let into a district of a million or so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0284.mp3|with westminster|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0286.mp3|and with london bridge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0287.mp3|there are ancient houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0288.mp3|late georgian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0290.mp3|as if querulously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0291.mp3|over the side hoardings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0292.mp3|they seem to gloom behind high walls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0293.mp3|in the shadow of tall trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0294.mp3|at the end of black gardens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0295.mp3|they are painted white|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0299.mp3|on their roofs among the chimneys and boughs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0300.mp3|once they were the considerable houses of an exclusive village|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0302.mp3|now the county council houses and their trams shall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0303.mp3|in the same spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0305.mp3|by right of roads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0306.mp3|touching these few houses is a short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0307.mp3|more modern but still old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0308.mp3|double line of shops|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0309.mp3|the more reputable touch the most jumbled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0310.mp3|they have been made by building sale rooms out over old gardens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0312.mp3|old curiosity shops|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0314.mp3|the queer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0322.mp3|and continue their individual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0328.mp3|plate glass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0329.mp3|soft stone and gilt letters crowds move slowly in front of these it is not possible to hurry even on the broad pavements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0330.mp3|and most people move leisurely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0331.mp3|with the head a little to one side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0332.mp3|looking at the large windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0333.mp3|carrying parcels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0334.mp3|then there are more old houses behind old trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0335.mp3|or behind little terraces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0336.mp3|then more new shops|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0337.mp3|a brand new theatre|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0339.mp3|domed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0340.mp3|suddenly holds aloft|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0341.mp3|at its very apex|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0343.mp3|it is startling because one does not expect the spectacular|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_04_ford_0344.mp3|it suggests the domed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0000.mp3|the effect in london is just as much one of jumble and the incongruous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0001.mp3|but there is nothing of the sinister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0002.mp3|if it is not an impression of pure happiness it certainly implies a contagious cheerfulness and good humour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0003.mp3|in these parts you hardly see a discontented face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0004.mp3|and never a morbid one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0006.mp3|and nearly up to westminster bridge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0007.mp3|old villas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0009.mp3|or stare at one another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0012.mp3|middle victorian here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0013.mp3|the railways produced this district|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0015.mp3|they are dropped down in terraces anywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0018.mp3|it is as if the poorer classes had come into the cast off clothes of the comfortable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0019.mp3|and found them roomy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0020.mp3|easy and luxurious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0021.mp3|i suppose the speculative builder accounts for this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0022.mp3|he found in one generation or the other bits of waste ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0023.mp3|or rows of smaller buildings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0024.mp3|he ran up at one time the fine old houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0025.mp3|at another the terra cotta shops|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0026.mp3|probably in each case he was miscalled by the old residents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0028.mp3|so no doubt the new shops will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0029.mp3|to our children's children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0032.mp3|and full of old memories|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0034.mp3|the speculative builder's lamentable failures may be traced too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0037.mp3|pretentious stucco houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0038.mp3|with middle victorian pinnacles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0039.mp3|gables and extravagances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0040.mp3|it breaks off in uncompleted doors|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0042.mp3|and a plot of grimy waste land|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0044.mp3|this place always piques my curiosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0046.mp3|getting the nickname blank's folly growing begrimed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0047.mp3|being forgotten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0049.mp3|inspiring too and impressive when they are full of people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0050.mp3|in the times when one is in the mood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0052.mp3|only more actual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0053.mp3|more pathetic and much more inspiring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0054.mp3|the other year i came in by way of the kennington road|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0056.mp3|past the elephant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0057.mp3|up london road our eyes had grown accustomed to a gloom in the upper air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0059.mp3|pallid under its lamps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0060.mp3|pale and grimy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0062.mp3|grim and surprising|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0063.mp3|the tall wedge of the eye hospital was a deep black among liquid shadows deeper still all the mysterious and gloomy london of ancient names and ancient lives seemed converging out of those shadows into that dark space|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0064.mp3|and suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0065.mp3|at a swinging round of the tram|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0066.mp3|there was a long trail of quivering lamps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0070.mp3|low down on the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0071.mp3|vanishing in the distance of waterloo road|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0072.mp3|the road was up for putting down the conduits of the electric system|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0073.mp3|and these lights guarded the trenches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0074.mp3|but there had been no announcement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0075.mp3|no expectation of a city rejoicing with illuminations it was the most gracious of surprises and an unforgettable thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0076.mp3|but that is london yet these great roads are oppressive when they are empty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0077.mp3|to enter london in a faint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0078.mp3|saffron dawn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0079.mp3|along with the market wagons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0080.mp3|is to be not awed by an immense humanity but disturbed by entering what seems some realm of the half supernatural|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0082.mp3|you sit at the shaft tail beside the driver|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0083.mp3|he is half invisible in the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0084.mp3|taciturn and half asleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0085.mp3|at last the street lamps appear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0086.mp3|at first solitary and brave in the dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0087.mp3|then more frequent and growing palely unnatural before the dawn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0088.mp3|the colours of the large horses begin to show|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0090.mp3|or you may lie softly enough high up on a bed of cabbages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0091.mp3|there used to be at the back of the camden town road a little hay market that i knew well it may be there still for all i know and it was far better to come in on top of the hay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0092.mp3|half under the tarpaulin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0093.mp3|with the sweet scent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0094.mp3|the warmth and the half dozing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0095.mp3|the pure air of the early dawn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0097.mp3|because fewer chimneys have been smoking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0098.mp3|one saw the solitary streets for immense distances with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0099.mp3|all along the roadways|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0100.mp3|little heaps that turned out to be cats crouching over garbage or courting they are the sign visual of london at the dawn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0101.mp3|with an air of mystery as of an unsuspected population revealed unawares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0102.mp3|but all the empty streets giving out echoes that one never hears during the day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0103.mp3|all the vacant blinds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0104.mp3|the sinister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0105.mp3|the jocular the lugubriously inquiring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0106.mp3|or the lamentable expressions that windows give to houses asleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0108.mp3|and the thought of all these countless thousands lying invisible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0109.mp3|with their souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0112.mp3|in its silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0115.mp3|and overpowering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0116.mp3|one coffee stall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0117.mp3|gray hooded and with a pale lamp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0118.mp3|does not break the spell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0120.mp3|nor a hundred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0122.mp3|and the undertones of the loafers before the tiny black brick houses of the little hay market|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0126.mp3|all the dawn sounds of london have that quality of thinness the hoot of locomotives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0127.mp3|the thunder peals of shunting trucks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0130.mp3|even the immensely loud awakening of the london birds seems small and circumscribed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0131.mp3|the railways seem to make london commence where the chimney pots begin to be in forests in comparison with the thames they are at the other end of the scale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0132.mp3|the river is a natural way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0133.mp3|roads wind upon hills|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0135.mp3|make nowadays detours that were once necessary in order to strike fords or to convenience great houses or solitary hamlets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0137.mp3|fill up valleys with embankments and crash through the town itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0170.mp3|at night they are most active|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0171.mp3|electric lights glare and seem to drop sparks from very high in the air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0172.mp3|blue and mistily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0175.mp3|one might be on some primeval plain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0177.mp3|in the glare of lightning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0178.mp3|to the unceasing crash of thunder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0179.mp3|primordial beasts grazing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0181.mp3|or in violent combat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0184.mp3|we are apt to shudder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0186.mp3|or we cry out these things are bringing in the millennium|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0187.mp3|perhaps they are to really descend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0188.mp3|not in body alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0190.mp3|into this whirl and crash|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0191.mp3|to see men running with set faces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0192.mp3|at the continual risk of their lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0193.mp3|that they may link up wagons bringing screws from birmingham|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0200.mp3|humanity is on the march somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0202.mp3|perhaps it shall it is possible in the contagion of these things to see the opening up of empires wider of sway than rome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0203.mp3|clearer of sight than greece|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0204.mp3|kinder of heart than carthage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0205.mp3|purer in joy than was to be had among the hanging gardens of babylon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0206.mp3|or is this only rhetoric|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0207.mp3|or only romance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0209.mp3|when on a train into london i feel almost invariably a sense of some pathos and of some poetry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0210.mp3|to the building up of this railway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0211.mp3|of this landscape of roofs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0214.mp3|like the ranks of an infinite number of regiments caught in the act of wheeling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0215.mp3|march out upon the open country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0217.mp3|and the serrated roofs look like the jagged outlines of pine woods with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0218.mp3|at the top|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0219.mp3|the thin spike of a church tower|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0221.mp3|in their regular furrows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0222.mp3|they present the appearance of fields ploughed in slate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0223.mp3|in tiles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0224.mp3|in lead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0225.mp3|with the deeper channels of the streets below|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0226.mp3|certain details strike at the eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0228.mp3|bewilderingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0229.mp3|like snow in a wind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0230.mp3|lines of rails shoot suddenly from beneath the embankments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0232.mp3|rather surprisingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0234.mp3|with cabbages growing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0235.mp3|and a discoloured donkey tethered to a peg|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0237.mp3|perhaps the comparative quiet fosters one's melancholy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0238.mp3|one is behind glass as if one were gazing into the hush of a museum|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0239.mp3|one hears no street cries no children's calls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0243.mp3|one sees too so many little bits of uncompleted life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0244.mp3|as the train pauses one looks down into a main street and all streets are hardly recognizable from a height|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0246.mp3|a ragged child turns a catherine wheel in the road and holds up her hand to the passengers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0247.mp3|suddenly a blue policeman steps into the roadway the train moves on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0248.mp3|the other day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0252.mp3|three children were waving their hands and turning up white faces to the train|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0254.mp3|white clothes were drying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0255.mp3|a little further on a woman ran suddenly out of a door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0256.mp3|she had a white apron and her sleeves were tucked up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0257.mp3|a man followed her hastily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0258.mp3|he had red hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0259.mp3|and in his hand a long stick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0260.mp3|we moved on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0261.mp3|and i have not the least idea whether he were going to thrash her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0264.mp3|incidents even so definite as these are more or less the exception|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0265.mp3|but the constant succession of much smaller happenings that one sees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0266.mp3|and that one never sees completed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0267.mp3|gives to looking out of train windows a touch of pathos and of dissatisfaction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0268.mp3|it is akin to the sentiment ingrained in humanity of liking a story to have an end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0269.mp3|and it is the note of all roads into london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0270.mp3|to indulge in the feeling to any extent would be to add a new morbidity to life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0272.mp3|quite literally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0275.mp3|one caught a glimpse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0277.mp3|but that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0279.mp3|is a universal sentiment and a note of all roads into london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0280.mp3|a note of london itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0282.mp3|or out of the universal desire to know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_05_ford_0283.mp3|if one stayed to think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0000.mp3|the thames is the oldest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0002.mp3|but its character as a road is obscured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0003.mp3|justly enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0004.mp3|along the others we travel to reach our work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0006.mp3|to meet our death|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0011.mp3|is a place of romance to the sailor who comes to london from the deep waters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0012.mp3|it is the signal that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0013.mp3|after his ninety days of empty sea and empty sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0014.mp3|he has come very near to his harbours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0015.mp3|sailors speak of the place with the remembrance of old and good times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0016.mp3|giving a soft look to the eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0017.mp3|a soft tone to the voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0018.mp3|they are the look and tone of those who think about old emotions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0019.mp3|of pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0020.mp3|of impatience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0021.mp3|of the times when they said only a day more now|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0026.mp3|and here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0027.mp3|for the river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0028.mp3|psychological london begins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0030.mp3|or to the others in the heart of town itself work for them ends there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0031.mp3|it is taken up by the red sailed barges they tack in their engrossed manner across and across the wide reaches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0032.mp3|they pass under the shadow of dull clouds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0033.mp3|of rain squalls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0034.mp3|under watery sunlight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0036.mp3|the smoke from factory chimneys|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0038.mp3|going about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0039.mp3|in front of bluffs covered with gray buildings and black trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0040.mp3|in exposed stretches of water they are covered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0041.mp3|right over the hatches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0042.mp3|by the wash from the sea tarnished sides of steamers so vast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0045.mp3|from the deck of a barge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0046.mp3|one looks at their passing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0051.mp3|anchored groups of skiffs where sand is hauled laboriously in buckets from the bottom of the river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0053.mp3|side by side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0055.mp3|they tack about gravely one after another beside a black smallpox hospital that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0056.mp3|out in the river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0059.mp3|these barges|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0060.mp3|in squadrons in a continual and mazy slant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0061.mp3|red sail cutting diagonally across red sail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0062.mp3|with here and there a large rent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0063.mp3|and here and there a white patch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0064.mp3|they give the character to this road into london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0065.mp3|to this river of toil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0066.mp3|their only rivals are the sludge boats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0068.mp3|low in the water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0069.mp3|and showing all black|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0070.mp3|they come back empty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0071.mp3|so high in the bows that a great streak of red shows from the keel upwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0072.mp3|they swing round in front of one or other of the sewage works|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0077.mp3|carry sand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0079.mp3|and a hundred other things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0080.mp3|occasionally one loaded very high with a stack passes them all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0084.mp3|astonishingly swift|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0085.mp3|racing barges|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0087.mp3|and roar and rustle through the water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0088.mp3|so at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0089.mp3|keeping out of the way of the sludge boats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0090.mp3|out of the way of powder barges|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0091.mp3|of great steamers of the famous lines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0092.mp3|of swift fish carriers that raise an enormous wash|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0095.mp3|mostly unsavoury and solitary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0096.mp3|but a beacon rises up beyond the wharf of a powder factory that faces a manure warehouse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0097.mp3|this beacon is spindly tall of iron lattice work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0098.mp3|and all beyond it the river runs as between high walls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0102.mp3|cordage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0103.mp3|a train of the large steamers lies heavy on the water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0104.mp3|hooting signals to agents ashore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0105.mp3|waiting at the dock gates for water enough to enter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0107.mp3|and from here upwards london offers a solid black facing to its river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0108.mp3|from here too the little companies of barges begin to break up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0109.mp3|some stop near the dock gates some turn into the london canals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0111.mp3|here at any rate the river as a road into london ends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0112.mp3|it is all the time a gray tide of work a moving platform of workers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0113.mp3|workers in london divide themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0115.mp3|into those who sell the labour of their bodies and those who sell their attentions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0116.mp3|you see men in the streets digging trenches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0117.mp3|pulling stout wires out of square holes in pavements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0120.mp3|if walls would fall out of offices you would see paler men and women adding up the records of money paid to these others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0122.mp3|you get the two things united here and there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0124.mp3|it is difficult to get away from this river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0126.mp3|empty squares of water lay parapeted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0127.mp3|arbitrary and dim in their eternal perspectives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0128.mp3|the straight lines of the water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0129.mp3|the straight lines of the parapets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0131.mp3|of the tops|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0133.mp3|all dwindled together into the immense and empty distances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0134.mp3|the rows of four footed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0135.mp3|gaunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0136.mp3|inactive cranes|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0139.mp3|fused and confused in their outlines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0140.mp3|beneath a weeping sky in which a drapery of clouds had the look of a badly blotted water colour painting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0144.mp3|heavy moustached man in blue clothes and with cheerfully brass bound cap and shoulders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0145.mp3|hurried out of a tin shed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0146.mp3|it was labelled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0148.mp3|rusty and sea fretted liner her lower sides gaped in large holes screened with canvas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0149.mp3|and from moment to moment obscured by grimy buckets of coal that rose from a lighter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0151.mp3|he hurried very fast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0152.mp3|with a masterful and engrossed step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0153.mp3|a cheerful blue figure with pink cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0154.mp3|dodging mechanically the pools of greasy water and the fat black mud between the sleepers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0155.mp3|he dived into another small office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0156.mp3|he was the chief officer of the liner that was coaling and he had a pencil behind his ear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0159.mp3|of the men hooking up long planks for the painters to sit on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0160.mp3|and of the painters themselves on the upper decks with that pencil he controlled all their labours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0161.mp3|as if he were twisting them into an invisible rope which passed through that tin office and up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0162.mp3|far away into town where other pencils and other pens recorded these things on large pages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0163.mp3|digested them into summaries and finally read them out to boards of directors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0164.mp3|those invisible ropes they are strong enough in all conscience seem to be the only tie between these two classes of workers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0165.mp3|between these two great camps set one against another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0166.mp3|it is astonishing how different london looks from one or from the other end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0167.mp3|speaking broadly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0168.mp3|the man who expresses himself with a pen on paper sees his london from the west at the worst he hopes to end with that view|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0176.mp3|as it were at his back|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0189.mp3|broad swept streets and a comparative glare of light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0190.mp3|is already a foreign land|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0195.mp3|sometimes perhaps in a holiday frame of mind he goes through it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0196.mp3|but it never matters to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0198.mp3|rigid rows of streets all of blackened bricks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0200.mp3|these are familiar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0201.mp3|these are real life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0202.mp3|these are homely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0203.mp3|as if warm and alive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0204.mp3|the other he does not much want to think about it would worry him|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0222.mp3|for the obvious secret of london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0223.mp3|its magnetism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0226.mp3|with the most salient fact in your experience the knowledge of a pollard willow in which there is always a dog fox asleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0229.mp3|or in the university of bonn you learnt the sorrows of achilles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0230.mp3|the binomial theorem|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0236.mp3|but the finer side is the romantic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0237.mp3|the adventurous the dreamer's spirit in mankind to whom work itself in imagination remains the primal curse|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0245.mp3|of the blondest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0247.mp3|will be all united into one serious frown over black and white stones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0248.mp3|like smaller tombstones standing or lying prone as if in a disastrously wrecked graveyard|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0259.mp3|the eyes of both young men will have serious and reflective expressions before they resume their game|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0261.mp3|in one way or another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0262.mp3|that what man has done man can do|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0278.mp3|his employers had advanced him money to buy the barge outright|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0279.mp3|he had carried freights until he had paid them back|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0293.mp3|waves a grimy hand wanting a thumb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0294.mp3|and says|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0295.mp3|just such a lad as you be bill johnston were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0298.mp3|for london calls out across the lands to the spirit of romance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0299.mp3|to the spirit of youth and the spirit of adventure to the finer spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0300.mp3|there are such glorious plums|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0304.mp3|it fills the bare rooms in whitechapel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0305.mp3|where dark and hook nosed men sit amid the stench of humanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0306.mp3|their mouths filled with small brass nails|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0311.mp3|the behind counters of large drapers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0314.mp3|dark eyed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0316.mp3|round the feet of dark men puffing cigarette smoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0317.mp3|and fair venetian girls lean back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0318.mp3|smiling and chattering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0324.mp3|with the air of sorcerers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0328.mp3|and condensed milk in pewter freezing pots like infernal machines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0330.mp3|because|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0331.mp3|to day as always and for ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0332.mp3|the streets of london are paved with gold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0333.mp3|i remember reading somewhere a long time ago an ingenious article pronouncing boldly that this splendid figure of speech|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0334.mp3|this myth shining down the ages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0335.mp3|was literally true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0339.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0341.mp3|or it may have been that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0342.mp3|according to the writer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0344.mp3|for some profound chemical reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0345.mp3|worth its weight in gold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0346.mp3|in either case a favoured few do undoubtedly possess the secret of alchemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0347.mp3|in that everything they touch mud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0351.mp3|because in london there are so many things to touch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0352.mp3|hence the immensity of london's silent appeal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0353.mp3|she calls to all the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0356.mp3|the holy land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0359.mp3|of burgundians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0362.mp3|then more wars of seven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0365.mp3|these things called to the adventurous of succeeding generations for ten centuries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0366.mp3|but these appeals were limited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0367.mp3|they called only to those who felt able to handle a sword|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0368.mp3|fire a thatch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0370.mp3|set a sail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0371.mp3|shoot in a wood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0372.mp3|march a thousand miles or come out of a death of thirst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0373.mp3|they were for the valorous alone who could work with their hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0375.mp3|offering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0376.mp3|like the figure on the duke of york's column|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0378.mp3|she seems to hold them for bank clerks and for bargees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0379.mp3|for charlatans and the founders of faiths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0385.mp3|to enter minutely into this movement would be impracticable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0386.mp3|it would take one very deep into that odd psychology of statistics that is called political economy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0387.mp3|but it had its rise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0388.mp3|this modern appeal of london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0389.mp3|at about the time of the triumphing principle of free trade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0400.mp3|both are possible enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0403.mp3|and the unquestioned wrong of the immediate future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0405.mp3|in the country they say that large clocks when they tick solemnly and slowly thud out the words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0407.mp3|alive dead because in this world at every second a child is born|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0408.mp3|a man dies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0413.mp3|what man has done man can do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0414.mp3|he raised the standard of the adventurer not only towards respectability but towards apotheosis before his day the great london adventurers were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0417.mp3|passively casanovas and cagliostros|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0418.mp3|roderick random's idea of making a career after the wars had failed him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0419.mp3|was to pretend in london to be a man of fashion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0421.mp3|or in some miraculous way to pick up a patron with influence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0445.mp3|but he upon the whole was the discoverer of the principle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0446.mp3|apply yourself to gain the affection of the immense crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0447.mp3|after his day the mere heiress and the patron as ends of a career vanish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0448.mp3|they remain merely as stepping stones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0451.mp3|in london at least|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0452.mp3|discovered the possibilities of capturing its custom in its smallest trifles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0454.mp3|the method in london is to invent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0455.mp3|or to buy up the invention of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0458.mp3|but in all the barbers all the hosiers all the drapers windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0459.mp3|it ought to be very cheap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0460.mp3|very picturesquely put on the market and just perishable enough to make a constant supply desirable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0462.mp3|there are already so many of these|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0463.mp3|there is at least one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0464.mp3|i am not sure that there are not several|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0467.mp3|there is a napoleon of pharmacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0468.mp3|one of the tea trade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0469.mp3|one of grocery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0470.mp3|one of underclothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0471.mp3|this is not a mere figure of speech on my part|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0472.mp3|the words are used month by month by each of these trade journals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0473.mp3|there is very obviously one of politics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0475.mp3|has become comparatively decorative a hobby for napoleons in retirement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0476.mp3|what one would sigh for is no longer the making of a people's laws or of a people's songs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0478.mp3|with that behind one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0479.mp3|one may die chancellor of the exchequer and a peer of the realm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0480.mp3|this obviously is desirable enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0481.mp3|we sigh very reasonably for business men in our cabinets|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0523.mp3|and his office had lockers all round it|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0542.mp3|which was rather fun|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0543.mp3|he looked out of window at the pump|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0545.mp3|and genially acknowledged that the|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_06_ford_0546.mp3|trade was full of rogues from ten until four|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0008.mp3|having devoted his two or three hours a day to it|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0034.mp3|that is why london attracts us so supremely|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0036.mp3|we put in another small stake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0037.mp3|and we continue until either we win|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0038.mp3|or our capital our energy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0041.mp3|or our taste for gambling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0042.mp3|come to an end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0046.mp3|but the essential note of those who stand out among workers in modern london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0056.mp3|but the pity for x|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0057.mp3|as for so many other amiable and gallant young men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0058.mp3|is that even in this modern market|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0059.mp3|the essentially old fashioned must be to be found at the bottom of the sack what work we do must still in one way or another be good in the sense of being attractive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0060.mp3|you must still lay a good coin of some realm or other on the green cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0064.mp3|but almost more romantic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0070.mp3|when p came into it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0071.mp3|it was already beginning to feel the touch of competition from stores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0072.mp3|it had relied upon old fashioned good customers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0073.mp3|it had never advertised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0074.mp3|p not only advertised generally and lavishly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0078.mp3|he tried to make up at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0079.mp3|he devoted his leisure time to a species of scientific investigation connected with his trade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0080.mp3|which along with napoleons of specialities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0083.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0084.mp3|was making a large and romantic bid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0086.mp3|he sacrificed his great name in his trade organs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0087.mp3|to the chance of gaining in the wider papers a considerable and undying fame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0088.mp3|and this is very characteristic of the conditions of modern work in london our poets have to gain a daily bread in the public offices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0091.mp3|they are doing it in order on sundays to preach in the parks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0093.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0095.mp3|makes them by reaction astonishingly idealist in their interior souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0096.mp3|i know a railway signalman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0097.mp3|he spends dreadfully long hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0098.mp3|high up in a sort of cage of wood and glass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0099.mp3|above the innumerable lines of shimmering rails just outside the dim cave of a london terminus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0100.mp3|he works himself dog tired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0101.mp3|pulling levers that are constantly bright with the friction of his hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0102.mp3|he listens to the drilling sounds of little bells|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0103.mp3|straining his eyes to catch the red and white placards on the breasts of distant engines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0105.mp3|making out of pith and coloured paper little models|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0107.mp3|of the english cathedrals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0108.mp3|his small holidays go in making trips to bath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0110.mp3|to durham|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0111.mp3|and his small savings are spent on architectural drawings and photographs of details|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0113.mp3|if life holds out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0117.mp3|this is an ideal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0119.mp3|but he does not in the least care about architecture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0120.mp3|i once met by accident a man of forty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0122.mp3|he rather disliked the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0123.mp3|but his ambition was to cover|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0124.mp3|on his bicycle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0125.mp3|every road of the united kingdom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0126.mp3|he inked over on his ordnance map each road that he travelled on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0128.mp3|in imagination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0129.mp3|as a glorious finale like a dream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0130.mp3|one of the sixpenny papers publishing a half tone block representing this map with all its coach roads inked and distinct like the filaments of a skeleton leaf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0133.mp3|in all the ages since nero carried off his five hundred bronzes from delphi|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0135.mp3|if they were not necessary for self preservation they would be imbecile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0136.mp3|the conditions of modern labour make them almost more than necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0137.mp3|a man who retires from any routine work at all strenuous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0141.mp3|from escapement to case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0142.mp3|one man as a rule renders true little cogwheels that have been made by machine|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0145.mp3|in just the same way one woman machines together trousers that have been roughly cut out by machine|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0148.mp3|and in just the same way in offices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0149.mp3|a partner mentions the drift of a letter to a clerk|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0155.mp3|work itself becomes an endless monotony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0156.mp3|there is no call at all made upon the special craftsman's intellect that is in all the human race|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0157.mp3|it is a ceaseless strain upon the nerves and upon the muscles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0158.mp3|it crushes out the individuality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0159.mp3|and thus leisure time ceases to be a season of rest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0160.mp3|of simple lying still and doing nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0162.mp3|on the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0163.mp3|to assert one's individuality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0164.mp3|and to still the cry of one's nerves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0165.mp3|this leads to these hobbies which|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0171.mp3|at any rate of the very poor|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0174.mp3|and this was her life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0176.mp3|when he could work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0177.mp3|made fair money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0179.mp3|and was next door to a cripple|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0183.mp3|and she had a horribly foul tongue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0185.mp3|a table was under a window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0186.mp3|a sugar box held coals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0187.mp3|another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0189.mp3|held bits of bread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0190.mp3|a screw of tea in white paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0193.mp3|when her man was in work or bad enough to be in hospital|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0196.mp3|he was out of the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0198.mp3|and a bit of bacon in the other because there was no fuel to pay for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0199.mp3|what he made went for the rent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0200.mp3|there was nothing else in the room except a mattress and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0201.mp3|on a damp and discoloured wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0208.mp3|and it was wonderful to watch her working engrossed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0209.mp3|expressionless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0210.mp3|without a word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0211.mp3|her fingers moved deftly and unerringly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0212.mp3|the light very dim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0213.mp3|the air full of the faint sickly smell of paste and of the slight crackling of thin wood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0215.mp3|sometimes she would sigh not sorrowfully but to draw a deeper breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0216.mp3|it was the only sound that was at all arbitrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0217.mp3|the only variation in the monotony of her life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0218.mp3|the only thing that distinguished her from a wonderfully perfect machine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0219.mp3|now and then a piece of the thin wood cracked along the line of a knot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0220.mp3|but she showed no sign of exasperation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0221.mp3|her husband as a rule sat in front of the fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0222.mp3|his right hand had lost two fingers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0223.mp3|his others were too swollen to be able to catch hold of a paste brush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0224.mp3|he sucked silently at the end of an empty pipe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0226.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0227.mp3|i used to stand in the doorway and watch what was appalling was not the poverty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0228.mp3|it was not the wretchedness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0229.mp3|because|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0230.mp3|on the whole|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0231.mp3|neither the man or the woman were anything other than contented|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0232.mp3|but it was the dire speed at which she worked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0234.mp3|in face of it any idea of problems|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0235.mp3|of solutions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0236.mp3|of raising the submerged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0237.mp3|or of the glorious destinies of humanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0239.mp3|the mode of life became as it were august and settled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0241.mp3|you could not wish to raise her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0242.mp3|for what could she do in any other light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0243.mp3|in any other air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0244.mp3|here at least she was strong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0245.mp3|heroic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0246.mp3|settled and beyond any condemnation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0247.mp3|as for ideals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0251.mp3|she had not even ideas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0252.mp3|she was an engrossed and admirable machine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0255.mp3|she would utter long bursts of language that was a mixture of meaningless obscenities and of an old fashioned and formal english|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0257.mp3|and she would shoot forth a monologue of grievances against her husband's mates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0258.mp3|shouldering the poor old chap out of a job|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0260.mp3|and him next door to a cripple|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0261.mp3|she had stuck the carving knife through the arm of a drunken man because he had tried to come into her room one night when her man was in hospital|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0263.mp3|these topics seemed to come out of her as words come out of certain machines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0264.mp3|unnatural and disturbing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0265.mp3|she had not much desire to talk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0266.mp3|her hands and eyes were continually going back to her paste brush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0267.mp3|but as for ideals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0271.mp3|helping her with the pasting above all she wanted the two lads to keep out of bad ways|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0272.mp3|and the two gals not to be bad gals with these here shiny top boots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0273.mp3|she wanted them to stop indoors and paste match boxes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0274.mp3|sooner than see them on the streets she would use the carving knife to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0275.mp3|she had a sister a flower hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0276.mp3|making artificial flowers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0277.mp3|who had fallen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0281.mp3|she would have it when the law permitted her children to aid her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0282.mp3|one desires privacy when one suffers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0285.mp3|i should say that she was as contented and as cheerful as myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0286.mp3|she probably knew better than people more enlightened and with higher ambitions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0287.mp3|the truth of the saying that was constantly on her lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0291.mp3|police court missionaries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0292.mp3|societies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0293.mp3|and sisters of the poor grow dim and childish along with the modern spirit itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0294.mp3|it was like interviewing the bedrock of human existence in a cavern deep in the earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0296.mp3|she supported them all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0298.mp3|it had once been a model dwelling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0299.mp3|the stairs were of stone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0301.mp3|the banisters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0302.mp3|the panels of nearly all the doors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0303.mp3|and sometimes the very doorposts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0304.mp3|every cupboard and every shelf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0305.mp3|had been chopped down for firewood as i went up past all these open doors and ragged door holes in absolutely every room there were women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0307.mp3|bending over tables or over old sugar cases|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0309.mp3|making umbrella tassels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0310.mp3|running together cheap coats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0311.mp3|making artificial flowers the very poor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0314.mp3|no cathedral spires and the turrets of no museums peeped over those serrated roofs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0315.mp3|that problem that is no problem the matter of the very poor workers becomes there the only question of london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0317.mp3|unfortunately perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0320.mp3|unfortunately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0321.mp3|one that any one man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0322.mp3|any ten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0323.mp3|or any two hundred can even touch from the outside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0324.mp3|all these districts are honeycombed with missions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0330.mp3|there is no movement and only work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0333.mp3|a problem to all human intents insoluble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0334.mp3|precisely because this particular class of worker is composed of individuals who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0335.mp3|through heredity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0336.mp3|through type through temperament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0337.mp3|for a hundred predestined and tragic reasons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0338.mp3|are absolutely incapable of creating movements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0343.mp3|they cannot combine they have not any thoughts left for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0345.mp3|they are inarticulate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0346.mp3|they are forming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0347.mp3|and they have been forming for years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0348.mp3|an hereditary class|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0349.mp3|education hardly touches their children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0350.mp3|it means that for ten or eleven years the poor little things are made acquainted with facts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0352.mp3|they learn no trade they go apprentices to no craft|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0353.mp3|after a year or two of matchbox making the facts of their instruction are worn down out of their minds and that very virtue of their mothers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0354.mp3|that fierce determination to keep the little things respectable means tying them more and more to their rooms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0355.mp3|that particular striving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0356.mp3|a fierce craze for keeping the children straight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0361.mp3|that is really so fierce and so logical a struggle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0366.mp3|if it have become in all its branches less of craft|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0367.mp3|depends more and more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0368.mp3|if its worker is to make any individual success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0369.mp3|on temperament temperament in that particular sense we must take to mean the quality of inspiring confidence in one's employer or in one's customer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0370.mp3|it is something akin to the artist's temperament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0372.mp3|the worker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0374.mp3|must impose his private personality upon a greater|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0375.mp3|or upon a lesser public|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0376.mp3|this tendency is most observable in the periodical press|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0377.mp3|that most enormous and most modern of industries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0378.mp3|here upon the whole the aesthetically intrinsic quality of the work offered by a young man does not matter much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0383.mp3|men who have not any nonsense about them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0384.mp3|nonsense in this case is impracticable ideas of one kind or another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0386.mp3|interrupted by frequent calls at a telephone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0387.mp3|will fidget towards a window overlooking the street in order to call pointed attention to the fact that his horse will not stand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0388.mp3|in that case he may demonstrate that there is not any nonsense about him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0389.mp3|that he is not dreamily poetic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0390.mp3|but up to date and practical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0391.mp3|he makes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0394.mp3|by acquiring a knowledge of the characteristics|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0395.mp3|the tone and the scope of the journal he has designs on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0398.mp3|merely wants to get at whether x will appeal to his own particular crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0399.mp3|this tendency of dependence on the tastes of the great crowd is most handily demonstrable in the case of the press|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0400.mp3|but it underlies every other industry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0401.mp3|i happen to have followed the career of a man who is now still young and a very flourishing cabinet maker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0402.mp3|he was the son of a widow in domestic service|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0403.mp3|huguenot by descent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0405.mp3|dark and handsome whilst a young boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0406.mp3|but not otherwise strikingly intelligent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0407.mp3|the master of his mother got him apprenticed to a working carpenter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0410.mp3|as soon as he was out of his time he set up for himself as a jobbing cabinet maker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0412.mp3|he continued to pay serious attention to fretwork|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0413.mp3|eventually he evolved what was practically a style|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0414.mp3|he made small hexagonal coffee tables|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0416.mp3|these things had a kind of pierced screen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0417.mp3|oriental in inspiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0418.mp3|between each pair of legs and were painted a dead white|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0419.mp3|he made perhaps a dozen of these with more than a dozen little stools|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0421.mp3|all in white|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0423.mp3|about this time w saw an announcement in his trade paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0426.mp3|he managed to see the proprietor of this shop it was in a well frequented thoroughfare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0428.mp3|which were ludicrously inexpensive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0430.mp3|some white stools|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0431.mp3|and a white settee stood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0432.mp3|or supported cheap oriental trays and vases full of peacock's feathers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0437.mp3|he had in him an astonishing faculty for knowing what the public in this case mostly young marrying couples could be induced to want he turned out cheap chippendales|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0440.mp3|he went with his customer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0447.mp3|and turn out in large quantities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0448.mp3|and w is rapidly growing rich|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0452.mp3|for of the worker nowadays there is demanded more than the old fashioned attention to work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0453.mp3|unless you wish to live for posterity you cannot any more put out good work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0454.mp3|work that is solid and lasting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0456.mp3|but also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0457.mp3|as i have said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0458.mp3|you must have temperament the temperament that brings luck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0459.mp3|because it makes you take the right step instinctively and at the right moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0460.mp3|and you must have that sympathy with the humanity around you that will let you know just what modification of your product will for the time hold the sympathy of the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0461.mp3|this essential holds as good for the company promoter as for the cabinet maker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_07_ford_0462.mp3|and you must have the qualities of inspiring confidence and of knowing instinctively whom you can trust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0001.mp3|of more and more importance as the spirit of combinations spreads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0006.mp3|she was shrewd and eccentric|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0008.mp3|and her breast in a mail of gold chains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0011.mp3|into either the personal factor must enter very largely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0015.mp3|the individual's sons and daughters will be simply the employees of the trusts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0016.mp3|and will view with indifference or with more probable favour their absorption by the state or the city in which they are interested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0018.mp3|will be so precisely the same in its effects on the individual worker that it may for my purposes be classed with either|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0019.mp3|the broad fact remains that the individual worker for the time being is doomed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0020.mp3|he has been so for a long time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0023.mp3|yet ever since cave let johnson dine behind his screen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0025.mp3|and to day it is impossible for the many of them to exist|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0045.mp3|on the other hand he must be an excellent accountant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0046.mp3|and he must impress his superior with his knowledge of human nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0047.mp3|he must be able to gauge|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0064.mp3|these works were started to work a new process about twelve years ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0065.mp3|and stanley|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0066.mp3|at the time a boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0067.mp3|helped in making the bed of the first engine he was particularly alert|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0068.mp3|and entered into the spirit of the thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0069.mp3|this at the time was not very obvious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0070.mp3|the engine being set down on the slope of a green hill into which it has since tunnelled and cut until an arena of sand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0071.mp3|of rubble and of chalk|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0077.mp3|the ground is sticky and white under foot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0079.mp3|a maze of small lines on which run tiny locomotives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0080.mp3|a maze of the little black shelters that cover drying bricks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0082.mp3|in the faint and sickly odour of steam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0083.mp3|under the drops that condense and fall from the eaves of engine sheds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0084.mp3|clambering through small holes|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0088.mp3|if he chances upon a visitor he becomes almost a spirit in ecstasy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0089.mp3|he slaps the bed of the engine that he helped to set there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0090.mp3|he bids workmen run the wet sand through trap doors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0091.mp3|he explains how these three industries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0092.mp3|set there together in that hollow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0093.mp3|work one into another so that nothing is lost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0094.mp3|the hot water from the boilers of the cement works runs in those open conduits to separate in the sand works the sand from the loam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0096.mp3|these things are the great the romantic facts of his world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0097.mp3|because they are so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0098.mp3|his managing director has advanced him very quickly from being a shovel boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0099.mp3|paddling in the warm and sandy water to be superintendent of the whole works|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0100.mp3|but it is almost more important that the hands all like him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0101.mp3|his director can go home and sleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0102.mp3|or leave the place for days on end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0103.mp3|confident that stanley has the knack of infusing into his men some of his own interest in the work itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0104.mp3|and that he will not by petty tyrannies bring on a strike|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0107.mp3|without at least a share of it stanley could never have risen from the ranks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0109.mp3|at the same time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0111.mp3|the making of stanley has meant throwing out of work of a whole small industry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0113.mp3|thames sand is indispensable in the london building trade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0114.mp3|it is stipulated for in all the contracts for honest mortar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0116.mp3|no thought is more oppressive than that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0117.mp3|a little way away or at a great distance people are unceasingly working to mature new processes that will ruin any one of the works that the eye rests on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0118.mp3|nothing can well be more tragic than such an announcement as this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0119.mp3|which one may read any day in a trade paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0120.mp3|owing to the competition of the new d process of messrs|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0133.mp3|but all these things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0134.mp3|if one is in the mood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0135.mp3|one may find stimulating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0136.mp3|because they tell of human toil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0138.mp3|since the other influences are working invisible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0139.mp3|like malign and conscious fates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0140.mp3|below the horizon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0141.mp3|to assist at the obsequies of one of these great works is more suggestive than to have seen the corpses in the snow of the retreat from moscow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0143.mp3|they suffer for no apparent principle|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0146.mp3|for no nation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0147.mp3|for no glory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0148.mp3|they suffer the shame of poverty without the compensating glory of defeat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0149.mp3|they have not ever seen their napoleon ride slowly along their cheering lines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0151.mp3|if it attracts men from a distance with a glamour like that of a great and green gaming table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0153.mp3|when they are close to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0155.mp3|without ranks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0156.mp3|without order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0157.mp3|without pity and with very little of discoverable purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_08_ford_0159.mp3|because in its want of logic it is so very human|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0002.mp3|and save for the very few whom philosophy really makes wise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0004.mp3|this mirage of the leisured class|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0050.mp3|the flicker of fifty couples whirling round before you as with a touch of headache you stood in a doorway|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0053.mp3|and a fatigue and a feverish idea that if you had missed any one of these unimportant things you would have missed life but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0055.mp3|or if you had been a saturday footballer who missed one match|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0056.mp3|you might have missed so much more of your life|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0060.mp3|your life is so much shorter|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0073.mp3|less filled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0076.mp3|the life itself is the more laborious and less of a life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0078.mp3|in the marking time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0079.mp3|that the course of a life becomes visible and sensible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0084.mp3|with your hands deep in your trousers pockets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0085.mp3|or listless on your watch chain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0088.mp3|speculating on nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0089.mp3|looking down on the unceasing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0093.mp3|the knot on a whip|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0094.mp3|the cockade on a coachman's hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0095.mp3|the sprawl of a large woman in a victoria|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0097.mp3|you live only with your eyes and they lull you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0098.mp3|so time becomes manifest like a slow pulse the world stands still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0100.mp3|and the rustle of newspapers behind your back in the dark recesses of the room might be a tide chafing upon the pebbles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0101.mp3|that is your deep and blessed leisure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0104.mp3|whether we are of the leisured class|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0110.mp3|it is that third state that makes us live|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0113.mp3|it is a bathing in the visible world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0114.mp3|it is a third state between work and amusement perhaps it is the real leisure it is not obviously a product of london alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0118.mp3|at black and white|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0120.mp3|at bright red and flame plumaged poultry on the green below him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0121.mp3|tastes it very well along with the flavour of the straw in his mouth and the women who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0122.mp3|after their hard days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0123.mp3|stand above the half doors of cottages and gaze at nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0124.mp3|but with them it is not a third state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0125.mp3|since it takes the place of amusement as well as rest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0127.mp3|since along with his hard physical work he has his sing songs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0128.mp3|his club nights|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0129.mp3|his visits to music halls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0131.mp3|i knew one very good fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0134.mp3|making good money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0135.mp3|and as regular as a church clock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0136.mp3|his hobby was chaffinches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0137.mp3|in the mornings before work and in the evenings he gave a certain amount of time to teaching his birds to pipe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0138.mp3|at nightfalls he would go to his public house for a couple of pints of ale and a few pipes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0142.mp3|and there on a sunday he would lie nearly through the day sucking up the treacle beer through the tube and gazing at the ceiling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0143.mp3|thinking nothing at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0144.mp3|letting his eyes follow the cracks in the plaster from one wall to another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0145.mp3|backward and forward for ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0146.mp3|late in the afternoon he would get up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0147.mp3|dress himself carefully in his best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0150.mp3|carrying them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0152.mp3|look restfully at the cages of birds exposed for sale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0153.mp3|meditating a purchase for next year|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0155.mp3|and losing himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0159.mp3|in the thick crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0161.mp3|the door open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0162.mp3|the interior a black and odorous darkness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0163.mp3|where you trod upon cabbage leaves and orange paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0164.mp3|behind this was another dark room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0166.mp3|in the light of brilliant gas jets were held the contests of the piping chaffinches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0167.mp3|there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0168.mp3|taking the gas jets for a fiercer sun|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0171.mp3|hard featured and intense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0172.mp3|with every eye fixed upon the small and straining singer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0173.mp3|fingers ticking off turns in the song and a silence broken by no shuffling of feet and no clearing of throats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0175.mp3|having scored his marks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0178.mp3|and put himself quietly to bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0179.mp3|thus his life was perfectly regular and calm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0180.mp3|hard muscular work giving place to sober amusement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0181.mp3|dashed once a week with that intense leisure of lying still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0182.mp3|looking at the ceiling and thinking nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0183.mp3|on off days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0185.mp3|he would take his cages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0189.mp3|they will lose the brilliance of their note|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0190.mp3|and finally mope and die|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0191.mp3|there are in london many thousands of men like this chaffinches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0192.mp3|bullfinches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0193.mp3|prize bantams|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0198.mp3|and even pigs occupy their leisure moments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0202.mp3|deliberate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0208.mp3|it gives them a chance to get rid of some of the stores of tenderness towards small living things which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0209.mp3|for lack of words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0210.mp3|they cannot so well lavish on their wives and children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0211.mp3|i have known a carter who did not apparently trouble himself in the least about illnesses in his own house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0212.mp3|driven to a state of distraction because one of his old companions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0213.mp3|a draught horse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0217.mp3|these fancyings not only the chance to gaze ineffably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0219.mp3|at the motions of animals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0220.mp3|but the chance of emulation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0223.mp3|of sharing in a sport|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0227.mp3|and what makes london in a way both attractive and salutary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0228.mp3|for we may say that the man who ceases to compete ceases to be a perfect man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0230.mp3|in the actual stages of heavy manual work there is no room for emulation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0231.mp3|it is true that in the country you have ploughing matches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0232.mp3|but they touch only the very few|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0233.mp3|you have cottage garden prizes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0238.mp3|as a rule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0239.mp3|these prizes flourish most in the neighbourhood of the small towns|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0242.mp3|mere bank holiday carouses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0243.mp3|not the hobbies that are necessary for the everyday life of a man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0244.mp3|thus the country districts are depleted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0245.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0247.mp3|we|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0248.mp3|loving a picture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0249.mp3|a melody a verse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0250.mp3|because for obscure reasons it calls up in us forgotten memories of times when we were young|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0251.mp3|in love or happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0252.mp3|so these fancies which are arts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0254.mp3|moods like those they felt in forgotten green fields|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0255.mp3|i know a man who breeds pheasants in the green enclosure of a city churchyard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0256.mp3|and when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0257.mp3|towards october in the early black mornings of that tiny and shut in square|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0260.mp3|these noble birds utter their shrill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0262.mp3|like peals of defiant laughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0263.mp3|their owner says rhapsodically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0265.mp3|dripping with dew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0267.mp3|but all the same it makes that city caretaker have all the sensuous delight of the green fields of his youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0269.mp3|down there it meant forty shillings if the keeper caught you so much as smelling a pheasant's neck feather|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0270.mp3|here he needed no gun license|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0271.mp3|and they paid him ten times over for their keep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0272.mp3|and kept his hands nicely full|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0273.mp3|so the birds with their delicate gait|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0274.mp3|high and dainty spurred steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0276.mp3|brilliant necks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0277.mp3|seek unceasingly for issues from the closed railings of the churchyard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0278.mp3|and contribute all that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0279.mp3|in london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0280.mp3|is needed to keep their owner there for ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0283.mp3|humorous scoundrel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0286.mp3|he spends his leisure time with his hands in his pockets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0287.mp3|leaning over the river wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0288.mp3|spitting into the eddies of the water and commenting on the ineptitude of the men on the dumb barges|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0289.mp3|their sweeps dip up and down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0290.mp3|to all appearances senselessly and futilely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0296.mp3|a matter of two miles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0298.mp3|but london has changed that making of former toils present leisure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0302.mp3|without anxieties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0303.mp3|his mind is kept employed by the things he best understands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0304.mp3|and it is because in london there are so many things to see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0305.mp3|so many anecdotes to be retailed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0306.mp3|such a constant passing of material and human objects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0307.mp3|that london holds us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0308.mp3|i do not know that it really sharpens our wits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0309.mp3|i fancy that it merely gives us more accidental matters on which to display them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0312.mp3|they were like this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0320.mp3|but the actual comments float in the air in class and class|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0321.mp3|in the classes that are as a rule recruited from the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0322.mp3|the type of mind is slower|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0327.mp3|because it has two experiences of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0328.mp3|and depends less upon the daily papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0329.mp3|the children of these countrymen are quite different|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0333.mp3|they have international nicknames for the food in cheap eating houses and for common objects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0340.mp3|for at least the poorer classes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0341.mp3|the place of animal fancies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0342.mp3|it dictates the daily and weekly press their very hobbies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0343.mp3|for to a man with an individuality and the countryman has a strong and knotted one as a rule his hobby is his mental anodyne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0344.mp3|to the real londoner the press is that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0345.mp3|you get the distinction strongly in this way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0347.mp3|at lunch time he spells out from this|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0359.mp3|but his son|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0360.mp3|an office boy|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0370.mp3|the play that failed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0372.mp3|alarming growth of the opium habit country's loneliness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0377.mp3|forgotten as soon as the first step is made upon the platform at mark lane or the mansion house stations as much forgotten as any telegraph pole that flickered past the train window out towards the suburbs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0379.mp3|for some reason or another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0380.mp3|particularly impressive to the lower order of londoner kaiser's telegrams is an evidence of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0382.mp3|immense isolation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0383.mp3|or immense conspicuousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0384.mp3|will drive a man to eccentricities of speech and action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0387.mp3|would run the risk of being silenced with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0391.mp3|accepted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0392.mp3|and even commented on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0395.mp3|but the london habit of mind it is probably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0397.mp3|it is what has made conversation in london a lost art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0398.mp3|it gives one something of a shock to read in emerson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0401.mp3|in america we are apt scholars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0402.mp3|but have not yet attained to the same perfection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0403.mp3|for the range of nations from which london draws|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0405.mp3|as a broken country makes picturesque landscape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0407.mp3|and secondly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0410.mp3|since we no longer utter sentences at dinners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0411.mp3|yet when we consider the ages of johnson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0412.mp3|of the prince regent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0413.mp3|even when we think of the table talk of shirley|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0414.mp3|we must remember and we must wonder what has become of that mighty stream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0415.mp3|and we must wonder why we will no longer listen to talkers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0416.mp3|why a talker is something we resent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0417.mp3|why in fact a conversational artist strikes us nowadays as a bounder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0419.mp3|as very old men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0424.mp3|nowadays we tell a good story with diffidence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0425.mp3|being afraid of being taken for a sort of theodore hook or professional diner out but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0427.mp3|london limits itself to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0430.mp3|seen such a play|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0431.mp3|or such a picture show|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0435.mp3|it is because we have become so democratic as emerson puts it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0436.mp3|that society resents any monopolist of talk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0437.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0439.mp3|the englishman never did really enjoy being talked to or entertained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0440.mp3|indeed an american hostess has put it on record that an english guest commented to her the other day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0444.mp3|conversation began to go out of fashion when the phrase|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0447.mp3|the distinction between our spoken and our written tongue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_10_ford_0448.mp3|for this the periodical press must be held responsible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0003.mp3|with comments upon her debated marriage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0006.mp3|months and years on end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0011.mp3|or practical projects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0013.mp3|preachers still retained the sole right to lecture upon divinity and books and preachers entered intimately into the lives of men and women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0016.mp3|at dinner tables|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0017.mp3|as to the abstract proprieties of the case of pamela|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0019.mp3|conversation in consequence was possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0021.mp3|with the coming of the modern newspaper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0022.mp3|the book has been deposed from its intimate position in the hearts of men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0023.mp3|you cannot in london read a book from day to day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0024.mp3|because you must know the news|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0029.mp3|it is hardly worth while to trace the evolution of this process|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0035.mp3|and nearly all power of connected thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0036.mp3|but if his dinner table has become democratized|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0037.mp3|and he will not suffer a connected talker among his friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0038.mp3|he still retains some liking for duly licensed preachers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0039.mp3|some respect for the official talker or moralist generally speaking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0040.mp3|he sets apart one day in seven for this individual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0043.mp3|the stolid london of squares and clean streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0044.mp3|to the westward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0046.mp3|the pavements are empty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0047.mp3|and as if whitened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0048.mp3|and where there are the large detached houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0050.mp3|and large old trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0051.mp3|the town still has its air of being a vast cemetery of large mausoleums|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0052.mp3|that no one ever visits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0053.mp3|then indeed that third state|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0054.mp3|the deep leisure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0055.mp3|settles upon the middle london of the professional and merchant classes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0056.mp3|there is a stillness a hush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0057.mp3|breakfast is half an hour or an hour later than on other days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0058.mp3|the perfume of coffee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0059.mp3|the savour of bacon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0061.mp3|of sausages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0063.mp3|the interminable rumble of all the commissariat wagons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0067.mp3|all that unending procession that on week days rattles and reverberates throughout the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0068.mp3|is stilled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0069.mp3|in the unaccustomed quiet you can hear the decent hiss of the kettle on its tripod|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0070.mp3|you can hear the rustle of stiff petticoats coming down from the second floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0071.mp3|you can hear even the voices of the servants in the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0072.mp3|just suggested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0073.mp3|as if down there an interminable monologue were being carried on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0074.mp3|and beside the breakfast dishes there lie still the sunday papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0075.mp3|as a rule there are two of these|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0079.mp3|the more venerable contain practically no news|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0081.mp3|but the arms that support these sheets are not the nervous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0083.mp3|the glances meander down the columns|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0084.mp3|there is time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0085.mp3|there is plenty of time as if the reader in that hush and pause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0087.mp3|just for once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0088.mp3|that he is after all a creature of eternity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0089.mp3|with all time before him there is an opulence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0091.mp3|as it were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0092.mp3|in that sort of london sunday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0094.mp3|the sunday paper is now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0095.mp3|i should say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0096.mp3|a much more general feature than it used to be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0097.mp3|it invades the most sabbatarian breakfast tables|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0098.mp3|but i remember that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0099.mp3|as a boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0101.mp3|every sunday morning it was considered that the exercise was good for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0102.mp3|lacking my daily walk to school and the paper shop was a dirty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0103.mp3|obscure and hidden little place that during the week carried on the sale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0107.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0110.mp3|as if they were white petals bearing oblivion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0112.mp3|restful and beneficent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0113.mp3|like so many doses of poppy seed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0114.mp3|in the backyards of small cottages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0119.mp3|on each back doorstep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0120.mp3|in his shirt sleeves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0121.mp3|in his best trousers and waistcoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0122.mp3|voluptuously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0124.mp3|that good fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0125.mp3|the london mechanic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0126.mp3|sits down to read the paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0128.mp3|in general|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0130.mp3|on sporting subjects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0131.mp3|on religious subjects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0132.mp3|even on subjects purely jocular and on such abstruse matters as are clever women popular|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0134.mp3|they fulminate against the vices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0135.mp3|meannesses and hypocrisies of the wealthy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0137.mp3|they preach patriotism or the love of god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0139.mp3|the londoner on sunday mornings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0140.mp3|before his sunday dinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0141.mp3|gets as a rule his dose of general reflections|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0142.mp3|and it is characteristic of him that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0143.mp3|although he cannot bear preaching that he might have to answer conversational preaching he dearly loves the preacher who is beyond his reach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0144.mp3|he will listen to sermons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0145.mp3|to funeral orations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0146.mp3|to public speeches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0148.mp3|he loves no novel that has not a moral basis of one kind or another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0150.mp3|that does not preach some sermon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0152.mp3|but it is characteristic of the strong lines that he draws between life and the arts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0153.mp3|that although he is never tired of seeing a hamlet upon the stage he will call a hamlet of private life morbid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0155.mp3|unhealthy and insupportable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0157.mp3|in the london of leisure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0160.mp3|or is not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0161.mp3|he is therefore driven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0162.mp3|the social londoner at his leisure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0163.mp3|to action instead of to speech|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0164.mp3|he puts his feet on the dinner table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0165.mp3|beguiles his after dinners with cards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0167.mp3|with the theatres|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0168.mp3|with moonlight automobile drives or with watching skating competitions on artificial ice he plays golf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0169.mp3|he witnesses cricket matches football matches billiard matches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0171.mp3|for hours of an evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0172.mp3|in front of the shops of the great highways|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0173.mp3|and these paradings are|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0174.mp3|for the million or so of the young people of this huge world that is london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0175.mp3|the great delight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0176.mp3|the great feature of a life otherwise featureless enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0177.mp3|in externals one parade is like another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0179.mp3|each set with its gossip|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0185.mp3|an impression of entering one vast family party amid the rustle of feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0186.mp3|of dresses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0188.mp3|the subdued shrieks of laughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0189.mp3|the hushed personal remarks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0190.mp3|as a rule in all these parades|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0191.mp3|in the fleet street monkey walk as at shepherd's bush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0193.mp3|cloth caps not consorting with bowler hats and straw yards with neither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0194.mp3|they talk with a certain ostentation and a certain affectation of swagger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0199.mp3|and feather hats shunning the straws perched forward over the eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0201.mp3|and at these electric moments the voices grow higher and little shoves and nudges pass like waves in a field of corn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0203.mp3|a youth slips away from a knot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0204.mp3|a girl hangs back from a line|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0205.mp3|till little by little the knots dwindle away altogether and there are no more lines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0206.mp3|the ceremonials of the actual greeting are astonishingly various and more rigidly observed than the etiquette of the court of spain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0207.mp3|in westbourne grove the young shop assistant raises his bowler|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0210.mp3|for all the world as they do in rotten row|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0212.mp3|both girl and young man uttering obscenities positively astounding|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0213.mp3|without any obscene intention in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0214.mp3|and then commences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0215.mp3|mysterious and ceremonial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0216.mp3|the walking out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0217.mp3|the period of probation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0218.mp3|the golden age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0222.mp3|an age of vague emotions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_11_ford_0223.mp3|of words uttered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0004.mp3|dear child it reads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0005.mp3|and sets us thinking of all sorts of dead children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0009.mp3|smoothed with the attrition of thousands of the feet of londoners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0010.mp3|of american tourists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0011.mp3|of members of parliament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0012.mp3|of prostitutes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0014.mp3|it states that here lie the remains of so and so many monks who died of the plague so and so many centuries ago when i was last in that dim place a man with a quick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0015.mp3|agitated step hurried up and down the cloisters like a dog nosing out a rabbit in a hedge he had a penetrating eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0016.mp3|a sharp nose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0019.mp3|his voice was sonorous and rather pompous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0022.mp3|and i said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0024.mp3|he added confidentially and confidently that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0028.mp3|he was by trade a cobbler and he was rather a good poet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0029.mp3|i really believe that posterity might be none the worse if it ever come to read some of the verses that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0030.mp3|with his own hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0032.mp3|he troubled no reigning sovereign and no established poet with his verses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0033.mp3|he never sent them to papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0034.mp3|sometimes he wrapped up repaired boots in an odd sheet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0035.mp3|and he was not in the least discontented or in the least mad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0037.mp3|he liked these cloisters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0038.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0039.mp3|because he could contemplate the memorials of forgotten monks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0041.mp3|children and philanthropists freezing in the cold and soot outside the walls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0043.mp3|it seemed to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0045.mp3|then i lost touch with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0046.mp3|and going down to clerkenwell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0047.mp3|found that his little shop had another tenant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0051.mp3|so that posterity may still benefit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0054.mp3|may still ensue translation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0055.mp3|london is full of such men poets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0058.mp3|men of great mechanical talents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0059.mp3|of great strength of will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0060.mp3|of lofty intellects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0062.mp3|or have not the luck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0063.mp3|the knack of self advertisement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0064.mp3|the opening to use their talents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0066.mp3|their intellects and this is the heaviest indictment that can be brought against a city or a world that it finds no employment for its talents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0068.mp3|of fallen leaves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0069.mp3|that it blunts our sense of individualities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0070.mp3|this london does more than any other place in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0073.mp3|as has been said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0078.mp3|the pickpockets or the men of genius we may pass in its streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0080.mp3|by its vastness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0083.mp3|so that it seems to be a city formed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0084.mp3|not for you and me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0090.mp3|the pleasantest size for a graveyard is one in which each man and woman at rest could rise up and proclaim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0092.mp3|i planted the chestnut that gives all that shade on the green|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0096.mp3|the trees that appear half unreal in the mistiness because they are such that no one would place anywhere but in a cemetery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0098.mp3|but no doubt it is the penalty of being dead that one's memorial should be grotesque|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0099.mp3|the penalty of fighting against oblivion which is irresistible and pitiless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0103.mp3|the city of oblivion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0104.mp3|consigns her dead to the distance of dim and grim suburbs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0105.mp3|at any rate there they take their rest and grow forgotten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0106.mp3|for it is impossible to imagine the ghost of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0111.mp3|i made my mark in my day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0113.mp3|late comers would answer sleepily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0115.mp3|who are you and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0116.mp3|if that for all units be the pleasantest for our resting places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0117.mp3|it is also the most human of units for those still labouring on this earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0119.mp3|as soon as a city becomes a mass of corporations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0121.mp3|we may consider athens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0122.mp3|which was a city not more vast than is kensington high street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0123.mp3|probably its inhabitants were not really more cultured or more wise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0124.mp3|but certainly they had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0125.mp3|each one of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0126.mp3|better chances of influencing all their fellow inhabitants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0127.mp3|and that for humanity would seem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0129.mp3|to be the best of social units|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0130.mp3|only the most hardened of democrats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0131.mp3|seeing humanity not as poor individuals but as parts of a theory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0134.mp3|from a human point of view athens was better than kensington high street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0135.mp3|or than westminster itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0136.mp3|so london casts oblivion upon her dead and clouds out the individualities of her living|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0137.mp3|we talk of the londoner and we firmly believe there is a londoner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0138.mp3|but there is none|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0140.mp3|in walking along the streets we open our eyes if we search for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0141.mp3|we never meet him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0142.mp3|we see men like jews|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0144.mp3|men with a touch of the negro|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0146.mp3|but the londoner we never see and the search is painful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0147.mp3|an awakened sense of observation is in london bewildering and nerve shattering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0148.mp3|because there are so many things to see and because these things flicker by so quickly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0149.mp3|we drop the search very soon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0150.mp3|and these great crowds chill out of us the spirit of altruism itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0152.mp3|living in a small community we know each member of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0153.mp3|we can hope to help|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0154.mp3|or to be interested in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0155.mp3|each man and woman that we meet on the roads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0156.mp3|or we can at least pay to each one the tribute of a dislike|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0157.mp3|but that in london is hopeless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0158.mp3|the most we can do is to like or dislike bodies of men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0160.mp3|if we take so much interest in our town as to be moderates or the reverse we may dislike our opponents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0161.mp3|if we be working men we despise the professional classes and distrust all others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0162.mp3|but the individual factor has gone and the power of the individual over the mass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0163.mp3|what prophet shall make london listen to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0164.mp3|where is london's distinguished fellow citizen these things are here unknown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0165.mp3|and humanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0166.mp3|as the individual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0167.mp3|suffers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0168.mp3|economically the city gains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0169.mp3|social reformers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0171.mp3|would make our corporations more vast our nations still more boundless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0172.mp3|for the sake of fiscal efficiency for the avoidance of overlapping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0175.mp3|but what we gain thus in the rates we must inevitably lose in our human consciousness and in our civic interests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0177.mp3|says the individualist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0180.mp3|what socrates of london would commence a discourse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0182.mp3|men of london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0186.mp3|nelson did at sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0189.mp3|are thinking about this cradle of the spirit of their race|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0190.mp3|this old heart of england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0192.mp3|for the londoner there is a convenient station on the underground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0195.mp3|as a place with strong features|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0196.mp3|a great history|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0197.mp3|a place of countless anecdotes whispering from every stone westminster is wasted on london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0198.mp3|yet it is the heart of england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0199.mp3|the cradle of its laws of its empire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0204.mp3|a more or less strong flavour of the theorist who sees mankind only in the bulk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_12_ford_0205.mp3|i imagine the individualist half of a man musing like this|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0016.mp3|much of our powers of abstract reasoning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0017.mp3|much of our old faiths|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0032.mp3|and nature is preparing for her tremendous waste of individual leaves|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0035.mp3|and small and great beasts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0037.mp3|and certainly the sap is stirring|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0039.mp3|and there is always a sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0040.mp3|but i stand in my window and look down the long perspective of a street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0041.mp3|it vanishes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0043.mp3|grows uncertain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0044.mp3|and fades into a black and uniform opacity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0046.mp3|there is no colour visible anywhere but gray save for the red of a letter box that seems to float|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0047.mp3|blotted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0049.mp3|and the white triangular tops of the lamp posts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0050.mp3|through the gloom hail falls steadily and close|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0051.mp3|like fine rain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0052.mp3|and behind it everything is flat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0054.mp3|as if the house fronts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0055.mp3|the garden walls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0056.mp3|the pavements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0057.mp3|were cloudy forms printed in gray upon a large cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0058.mp3|suddenly space exists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0059.mp3|it is as if a red torch were shaken in the air and quenched that is lightning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0060.mp3|a reminder of the outside world that we have half forgotten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0061.mp3|a broad shaft of sunlight reddens for an instant|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0064.mp3|it fades|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0065.mp3|and the eye is drawn upwards to an immense and sullen glow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0066.mp3|the edge of a heavy cloud that towers perpendicularly on high|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0068.mp3|becomes for that moment visible and manifest on account of that rift in its surface|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0069.mp3|it joins again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0070.mp3|the blackness descends once more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0071.mp3|the hail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0072.mp3|the colourlessness of all the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0073.mp3|the houses once more look like clouds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0074.mp3|and indeed it is impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0075.mp3|without an effort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0076.mp3|to dissociate in our minds the idea of london from the idea of a vast cloud beneath a cloud as vast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0080.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0082.mp3|they fade into one mass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0085.mp3|but all the limitless stretches of roofs that you have never seen the streets that you will never travel the miles and miles of buildings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0087.mp3|of almonds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0089.mp3|and the corporations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0090.mp3|the water boards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0091.mp3|the dock boards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0093.mp3|the bodies of men who keep the parks in order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0095.mp3|they seem unnatural|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0096.mp3|all these things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0097.mp3|and london itself is at times apt to seem unreal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0100.mp3|sudden rises|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0101.mp3|it is almost astonishing that anything so natural and so real should remain in the heart of this cloud beneath a cloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0103.mp3|little by little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0104.mp3|the londoner comes to forget that his london is built upon real earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0105.mp3|he forgets that under the pavements there are hills|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0106.mp3|forgotten water courses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0107.mp3|springs and marshland|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0108.mp3|and beneath and amongst all those clouds thunderclouds|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0115.mp3|to destroy these individualities is impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0117.mp3|however whose ideal of impersonality is so close|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0119.mp3|and so unflinching that he would abolish all names of persons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0120.mp3|substituting numbers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0121.mp3|he would have all men and women who perform any public functions|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0123.mp3|go masked and dressed in cloaks that should destroy all distinction of figure and limbs|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0126.mp3|personality must go|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0135.mp3|but after all no doubt it matters little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0137.mp3|they run up barracks that apparently are distinguished by no single merit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0138.mp3|but those georgian houses that are disappearing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0139.mp3|swept away in their day houses older|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0229.mp3|so it weakens the spirit of the family and the spirit of hospitality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0232.mp3|an old gentleman who would never quarrel with anyone in his own house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0233.mp3|because of his respect for his own roof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0235.mp3|he would not even write an unfriendly letter in his own or a friend's house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0236.mp3|consequently if he wanted to have it out with a man he had to invite him to some public place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0238.mp3|if he wanted to write to the times denouncing some public job he would retire to the nearest hotel and call for a pint of claret|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0240.mp3|he would himself acknowledge that these proceedings were rather exaggerated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0241.mp3|but his instinctive feelings in the matter were so strong that not even the necessity of a bath chair in extreme old age could prevent his going to that hotel for that purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0242.mp3|that feeling i fancy has died out or is dying in london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0244.mp3|and the sanguine reformer foresees also a gradual decay of respect for family portraits|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0249.mp3|that we build great houses or inhabit them|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0253.mp3|these things are full of cobwebs dirt microbes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0254.mp3|and the old houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0255.mp3|that are largely our ideals still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0260.mp3|says this reformer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0261.mp3|we ought in the interests of hygiene to cultivate an extreme cleanliness and that is only possible with a minimum of furniture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0263.mp3|as far as possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0264.mp3|portability in our houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0265.mp3|because ground that has been dwelt upon too long loses its resilience|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0271.mp3|are so many cobwebs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0272.mp3|and send the best of old family portraits into the museums|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0273.mp3|these last will soon says the reformer seeing his dream as a reality of to morrow be the sole heavy buildings to raise lofty roofs and turrets above the plateau of small houses houses of aluminium|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0284.mp3|the growing restlessness of the people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0285.mp3|the desire for change of scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0288.mp3|above all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0289.mp3|according to this reformer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0291.mp3|i suppose that such a london with its portable houses|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0299.mp3|will shudder at what is raw and naked in this idea but what is the alternative london that is offered us by the man who upholds the past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_13_ford_0302.mp3|and here and there a clump of trees|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0113.mp3|individualities stamp themselves upon the very waste ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0115.mp3|to those who love their fellow men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0116.mp3|it seems unnecessary to fear much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0117.mp3|even in the utopia london of masks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0123.mp3|one domino be worn more jauntily|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0126.mp3|the minute differences will be all the more apparent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0127.mp3|even to day class and class of us go seeking appointments in uniforms that if individuality could be blotted out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0128.mp3|would surely do it we go to offices in high hats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0130.mp3|or in bowlers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0133.mp3|but there is difference enough between wearer and wearer of these uniforms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0134.mp3|tall blocks of office buildings are crushing out the associations of the westminster courts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0137.mp3|meaning nothing to us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0138.mp3|heavy masses that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0139.mp3|to those of us who care about architectural proportions|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0144.mp3|the memoirists have not yet written them up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0146.mp3|these heavinesses will be suggestive because we|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0151.mp3|when westminster was still an ecclesiastical islet with a drawbridge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0152.mp3|odd roads and quaint figures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0154.mp3|and there were monks who rejoiced that new stone salting houses had taken the place of the old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0155.mp3|rotting wooden curing huts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0156.mp3|they thought their houses looked better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0157.mp3|just as nearly all london thinks the office buildings look better than the eighteenth century rabbit warrens of small houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0158.mp3|and there were others who foresaw gigantic and impersonal futures for the church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0160.mp3|or for mankind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0163.mp3|for humanity craves for admiration to give and to take|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0164.mp3|in the streets you will still hear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0165.mp3|oh such a one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0168.mp3|isn't he whether so and so be a surgeon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0169.mp3|an admiral|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0170.mp3|or the administrator of a province in upper burma|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0171.mp3|so the populations of the many towns that form london jog along together towards their inevitable rest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0172.mp3|the associations that are forming around our street improvements are none the less poignant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0173.mp3|because they are less historic in the large|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0174.mp3|for the poignancy of these things comes from the man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0176.mp3|these sayings without doubt are so many platitudes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0177.mp3|but if we consider rest in london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0178.mp3|we have to consider the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0179.mp3|and to consider the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0181.mp3|which are brave platitudes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0182.mp3|there remains then the question of physical deterioration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0186.mp3|but young and alert with beady eyes behind large spectacles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0187.mp3|it's as old as the hills|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0189.mp3|so was lot's wife when she looked back|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0193.mp3|when did the deterioration begin he paced up and down his consulting room smiling|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0209.mp3|to be near water you understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0210.mp3|near water and they drained into that water and they were plague houses all of them|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0213.mp3|why they fold their hands and die for a touch of liver|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0228.mp3|that indeed is the problem which is set before london the apotheosis of modern life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0229.mp3|for there is no ignoring the fact that mankind elects to live in crowds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0230.mp3|if london can evolve a town type london will be justified of its existence|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0233.mp3|a race will survive|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0240.mp3|sanitary conditions must be enforced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0241.mp3|rookeries must be cleared out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0243.mp3|and it must be remembered that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0244.mp3|for the christian era|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0245.mp3|this is a new problem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0246.mp3|no occidental cities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0249.mp3|none have begun to exist until the beginning of the commercial ages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0250.mp3|the problem is so very young that we have only just begun to turn our attention to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0252.mp3|if the rest that comes with extinction is not to be the ultimate lot of london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0253.mp3|the problem must solve itself either here or there in the evolution either of a healthy city or of a race with a strong hold upon life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0254.mp3|we know that equatorial swamps have evolved tribes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0257.mp3|fitted to live in damp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0260.mp3|there is no reason therefore why london should not do as much for her children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0261.mp3|that would indeed be her justification the apology for her existence|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0302.mp3|in the end we must all leave london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0303.mp3|for all of us it must be again london from a distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0305.mp3|or whether we go to rest somewhere on the other side of the hills that ring in this great river basin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0313.mp3|on the sky there will still be that brooding and enigmatic glow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0314.mp3|as if london with a great ambition strove to grasp at heaven with arms that are shafts of light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0315.mp3|that is london writing its name upon the clouds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0316.mp3|and in the hearts of its children it will still be something like a cloud a cloud of little experiences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0317.mp3|of little personal impressions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10633/souloflondon_14_ford_0319.mp3|futile things that|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0005.mp3|on mitten island there is a model village|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0006.mp3|consisting of several hundred houses|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0022.mp3|it would seem more likely|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0032.mp3|take further steps aside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0033.mp3|the sixth member was only too apt to put her trust in committees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0034.mp3|herself she did not trust at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0037.mp3|she had come to london two years ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0038.mp3|with a little trunk and a lot of good intentions as her only possessions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0039.mp3|and she had paid the inevitable penalty for her earnestness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0040.mp3|it is a sad thing to see any one of naturally healthy and rebellious tendency stray into the flat path of charity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0041.mp3|gay heedless young people set their unwary feet between the flowery borders of that path|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0043.mp3|committees lie in wait for them on every side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0044.mp3|hostels and settlements entice them fatally to break their journey at every mile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0045.mp3|they run rejoicing to their doom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0046.mp3|and i think shall eventually find themselves without escape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0047.mp3|elected eternal life members of the committee that sits around the glassy sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0049.mp3|to be in the vortex is i believe almost always to see less|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0050.mp3|the bull's eye is generally blind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0051.mp3|the sixth member was a person who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0052.mp3|where social work was concerned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0053.mp3|did more or less as she was told|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0054.mp3|without doing it particularly well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0056.mp3|very properly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0059.mp3|and ringing the bells of people who are almost always found to be away for a fortnight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0061.mp3|perhaps it would be more practical to call the sixth member sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0064.mp3|she was washing it behind the counter of her shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0065.mp3|she was the manageress of the only shop on mitten island|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0066.mp3|it was a general shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0067.mp3|but made a speciality of such goods as happiness and magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0068.mp3|unfortunately happiness is rather difficult to get in war time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0069.mp3|sometimes there was quite a queue outside the shop when it opened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0070.mp3|and sometimes there was a card outside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0071.mp3|saying politely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0072.mp3|sorry it's no use waiting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0073.mp3|i haven't any|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0075.mp3|and it was with sunlight soap that the shop lady was washing her hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0076.mp3|because it was sunday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0077.mp3|and this was a comparatively cheap amusement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0078.mp3|she had no money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0079.mp3|she had meant to go down to the offices of her employer after breakfast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0080.mp3|to borrow some of the salary that would be due to her next week|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0081.mp3|but then she found that she had left her broomstick somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0082.mp3|as a rule harold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0083.mp3|for that was the broomstick's name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0084.mp3|was fairly independent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0085.mp3|and could find his way home alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0086.mp3|but when he got mislaid and left in strange hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0087.mp3|and particularly when kindly finders took him to scotland yard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0088.mp3|he often lost his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0090.mp3|in your innocence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0092.mp3|but you have no idea what arduous work it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0093.mp3|breaking in a wild broomstick to the saddle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0094.mp3|it sometimes takes days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0095.mp3|and is not really suitable work for a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0096.mp3|even in war time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0097.mp3|often the brutes are savage and always they are obstinate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0098.mp3|the shop lady could not afford to go to the city by tube|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0100.mp3|which was rather expensive and erratic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0101.mp3|not being l c c of course a flash of lightning is generally available for magic people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0102.mp3|but it is considered not only unpatriotic but bad form to use lightning in war time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0103.mp3|the shop was not expecting customers on sunday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0104.mp3|but its manageress had hardly got her head well into the basin when somebody entered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0105.mp3|she stood up dripping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0107.mp3|after a pause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0109.mp3|no said the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0110.mp3|but do take a seat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0111.mp3|we met last night you may remember|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0113.mp3|i've got an extra coupon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0115.mp3|i've only got sevenpence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0116.mp3|just enough to take me home answered sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0117.mp3|but i can pawn my ear rings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0118.mp3|i dare say you have never been in a position to notice that there is no pawn shop on mitten island|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0119.mp3|the inhabitants of model villages always have assured incomes and pose as lilies of the field|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0120.mp3|sarah brown and her hostess sat down on the counter without regret to a luncheon consisting of one orange|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0121.mp3|found by the guest in her bag and divided|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0122.mp3|and two thin captain biscuits from stock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0124.mp3|both were cheerfully familiar with the feeling of light tragedy which invades you towards six o'clock p m|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0125.mp3|if you have not been able to afford a meal since breakfast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0126.mp3|now look here said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0127.mp3|as she plunged her pocket knife into the orange|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0128.mp3|would you mind telling me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0129.mp3|are you a fairy or a third floor back or anything of that sort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0130.mp3|i won't register it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0131.mp3|or put it on the case paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0132.mp3|i promise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0133.mp3|though if you are superhuman in any way i shall be seriously tempted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0134.mp3|i am a witch said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0135.mp3|now witches and wizards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0136.mp3|as you perhaps know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0138.mp3|i suppose we have all passed through this fair experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0139.mp3|we must all have had our chance of making magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0140.mp3|but to most of us it came in the boring beginning of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0142.mp3|and protoplasms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0143.mp3|and angels with flaming swords|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0144.mp3|all of whom knew magic too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0145.mp3|and were not impressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0146.mp3|witches and wizards are now rare though not so rare as you think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0147.mp3|remembering nothing they know nothing and are not bored|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0148.mp3|they have to learn everything from the very beginning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0149.mp3|except magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0150.mp3|which is the only really original sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0151.mp3|to the magic eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0152.mp3|magic alone is commonplace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0153.mp3|everything else is unknown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0155.mp3|and undespised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0156.mp3|magic people are always obvious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0157.mp3|so obvious that we veteran souls can rarely understand them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0158.mp3|they are never subtle and though they are new they are never modern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0159.mp3|you may tell them in your cynical way that to day is the only real day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0160.mp3|and that there is nothing more unmentionable than yesterday except the day before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0161.mp3|they will admire your cleverness very much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0162.mp3|but the next moment you will find the witch sobbing over tennyson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0164.mp3|you cannot really stir up magic people with ordinary human people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0165.mp3|you and i have climbed over our thousand lives to a too dreadfully subtle eminence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0166.mp3|in our day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0167.mp3|in our many days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0168.mp3|we have adored everything conceivable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0169.mp3|and now we have to fall back on the inconceivable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0170.mp3|we stand our idols on their heads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0171.mp3|it is newer to do so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0172.mp3|and we think we prefer them upside down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0173.mp3|talking constantly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0175.mp3|and perhaps if we are lucky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0176.mp3|once or twice in a score of lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0177.mp3|the blindfolding handkerchief slips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0178.mp3|and we wriggle one eye free|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0179.mp3|and see gods like trees walking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0180.mp3|by jove that gives us enough to talk about for two or three lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0181.mp3|witches and wizards are not blinded by having a point of view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0183.mp3|all witches and wizards are born strangely and die violently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0185.mp3|from women who wrought domestic magic and perished for its sake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0186.mp3|and from men who wrought other magic among lost causes and wars without gain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0187.mp3|and fell and died|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0188.mp3|still surprised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0189.mp3|still interested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0190.mp3|with their faces among flowers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0191.mp3|all men who die so are not wizards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0193.mp3|but all such bring a potential strain of magic into their line|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0194.mp3|a witch said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0196.mp3|i have been trying to remember what broomsticks reminded me of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0197.mp3|a witch of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0199.mp3|the witch was unaware that the proper answer to this was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0201.mp3|do you know i had quite a crush on you from the first minute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0202.mp3|she did not answer at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0203.mp3|and sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0204.mp3|who was tired of proper answers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0205.mp3|was not sorry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0207.mp3|so she filled it herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0208.mp3|saying pedantically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0209.mp3|of course i don't believe friendship is an end in itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0210.mp3|only a means to an end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0211.mp3|i don't know what you mean said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0212.mp3|after wrestling conscientiously with this remark for a minute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0213.mp3|do tell me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0214.mp3|do you know yourself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0218.mp3|a shop said sarah brown who was sitting on the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0219.mp3|it is a sort of convent and monastery mixed replied the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0220.mp3|i am connected with it officially|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0222.mp3|not undertaker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0223.mp3|is it superintendent or secretary suggested sarah brown moodily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0224.mp3|superintendent i think said the witch|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0299.mp3|a lot of people can swallow everything but the last clause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0301.mp3|she replaced the prospectus in the drawer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0305.mp3|what do you do with your magic she asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0306.mp3|oh many things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0307.mp3|chiefly i use it as an ingredient for happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0308.mp3|sometimes to remind people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0309.mp3|and sometimes to make them forget|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0310.mp3|it seems to me that some people take happiness rather tragically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0311.mp3|i find said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0312.mp3|rather sententiously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0313.mp3|that i always owe my happiness to earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0314.mp3|never to heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0316.mp3|i know nothing about heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0317.mp3|when i used to work in the city|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0318.mp3|i bought a little book about heaven to read in the tube every morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0319.mp3|i thought i should grow daily better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0320.mp3|but i couldn't see that i did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0321.mp3|sarah brown was naturally astonished to meet any one who did not know all about heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0323.mp3|sarah brown meant to write a book some day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0324.mp3|if she could find a really inspiring exercise book to start in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0325.mp3|she thought herself rather good at ideas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0326.mp3|poor sarah brown she simply had to be confident about something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0327.mp3|she was only inwardly articulate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0329.mp3|not outwardly at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0330.mp3|but sometimes she could talk about herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0331.mp3|heaven has given me wretched health|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0333.mp3|heaven gave me a thin skin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0334.mp3|but never gave me the natural and comforting affections|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0335.mp3|heaven probably meant to make a noble woman of me by encrusting me in disabilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0336.mp3|but it left out the necessary nobility at the last moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0337.mp3|it left out in fact all the compensations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0338.mp3|but luckily i have found the compensations for myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0339.mp3|i just had to find something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0340.mp3|men and women have given me everything that such as i could expect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0341.mp3|i have never met with reasonless enmity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0342.mp3|never met with meanness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0343.mp3|never met with anything more unbearable than natural indifference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0344.mp3|from any man or woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0346.mp3|i have been an ill and fretful stranger within all men's gates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0347.mp3|i have asked much and given nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0348.mp3|i have never been a friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0349.mp3|nobody has ever expected any return from me yet nothing was grudged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0352.mp3|chorus girls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0353.mp3|social bounders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0354.mp3|prostitutes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0357.mp3|of such as i|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0358.mp3|have given me kindness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0359.mp3|and often much that they could not easily spare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0360.mp3|and always amusement and distraction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0362.mp3|how you interest and excite me said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0363.mp3|whose attention had been frankly wandering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0364.mp3|you are exactly the sort of person we want in this house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0365.mp3|but ill said sarah brown pessimistically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0368.mp3|or whether she has one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0369.mp3|illnesses are never bad here said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0371.mp3|three fingers of happiness neat and hot at night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0374.mp3|this is the worst of all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0376.mp3|you can hear what i say said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0377.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0378.mp3|i can hear what you say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0380.mp3|and every day there are more and more locked doors between me and the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0381.mp3|you do not know how horrible it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0383.mp3|well said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0384.mp3|as long as you can hear magic you will not lack a key to your prison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0385.mp3|sometimes it's better not to hear the other things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0386.mp3|you are the ideal guest for the house of living alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0387.mp3|i'll go and fetch david my dog and humphrey my suit case said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0388.mp3|at that moment a taxi was heard to arrive at the other side of the ferry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0390.mp3|all right all right i'll be there in half a tick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0392.mp3|i get so tired of expelling guests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0393.mp3|she's been drawing her money which may have been tempting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0395.mp3|they heard someone alight from the ferry boat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0399.mp3|no he doesn't shouted the witch opening the shop door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0400.mp3|but do step in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0404.mp3|we don't bake ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0405.mp3|i have had tea thank you said miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0406.mp3|i have just come from a little gathering of friends on the other side of the river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0407.mp3|and i thought i would call here on my way home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0408.mp3|i had noted your address|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0409.mp3|she started as she came in and saw sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0410.mp3|and added in her committee voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0411.mp3|i had noted your address|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0412.mp3|because i never mind how much trouble i take in following up a promising case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0414.mp3|on first hearing that trenchant voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0416.mp3|but the biscuit tins refused to make room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0417.mp3|so she drew herself up and smiled politely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0418.mp3|how good of you to go to a little gathering of friends said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0419.mp3|obviously trying to behave like a real human person|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0420.mp3|i never do except now and then by mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0421.mp3|and even then i only stay when there are grassy sandwiches to eat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0422.mp3|once there were grassy sandwiches mixed with bits of hard boiled egg|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0423.mp3|and then i stayed to supper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0424.mp3|you didn't have such luck i see or you would look happier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0425.mp3|i don't go to my friends for their food|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0426.mp3|but for their ideas said miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0427.mp3|sarah brown was gliding towards the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0429.mp3|don't go said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0432.mp3|he is an excellent packer and very clean in his person and work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0433.mp3|please please don't go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0434.mp3|do you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0435.mp3|i live in constant dread of being left alone with a clever person|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0439.mp3|i repeat i only came because i saw yours was an exceptional case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0440.mp3|there was a very long silence in the growing dusk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0441.mp3|the moon could already be seen through the glass door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0443.mp3|pushing vigorously aside the thickets of the crowded sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0444.mp3|a crack across the corner of the glass was lighted up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0446.mp3|plucked from a passing storm and preserved in the glass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0447.mp3|miss ford suddenly began to talk in a very quick and confused way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0450.mp3|and that nothing she might say in parenthesis like this ought to be remembered against her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0452.mp3|god said miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0453.mp3|i have come because i am hungry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0456.mp3|you spoke of an april sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0458.mp3|you spoke of a shore of brown diamonds flat to the ruffled sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0461.mp3|well said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0462.mp3|well faltered miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0463.mp3|i think i came to ask you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0464.mp3|whether you knew of nice lodgings there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0466.mp3|respectable cooking hot and cold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0467.mp3|her voice faded away pathetically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0468.mp3|there was a sudden shattering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0469.mp3|as the door burst open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0472.mp3|her face was scarlet neat and formal again now but scarlet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0477.mp3|four important meetings yesterday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0478.mp3|i sometimes think i shall break down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0479.mp3|i have such alarming nerve storms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0480.mp3|she looked nervously at sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0481.mp3|it is always tiresome to meet fellow members of committees in private life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0482.mp3|especially if one is in a mood for having nerve storms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0483.mp3|people may be excellent in a philanthropic way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0485.mp3|and yet impossible socially|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0486.mp3|but sarah brown had heard very little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0487.mp3|she always found miss ford's voice difficult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0488.mp3|she was on her knees asking her dog david what it had felt like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0489.mp3|coming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0490.mp3|but david was still too much dazed to say much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0491.mp3|you must not think said miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0492.mp3|that because i am a practical worker i have no understanding of inner meanings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0493.mp3|on the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0494.mp3|i have perhaps wasted too much of my time on spiritual matters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0495.mp3|that is why i take quite a personal and special interest in your case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0496.mp3|i had a great friend now in the trenches alas who possessed power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0497.mp3|he used to come to my wednesdays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0498.mp3|at least i used to invite him to come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0499.mp3|but he was dreamy like you and constantly mistook the date|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0504.mp3|and i saw at a glance that your case was exceptional|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0508.mp3|do you mean just knowing magic a strange mixture mused miss ford self consciously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0509.mp3|it is impossible to muse aloud without self consciousness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0511.mp3|the question is power to what extent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0513.mp3|i want you to come to one of my wednesdays to meet one or two people who might possibly help you to a job|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0515.mp3|lectures on hypnotism or spiritualism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0517.mp3|are always popular|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0518.mp3|you certainly have power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0519.mp3|you only want a little advertisement to be a real help to many people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0521.mp3|this new advertisement stunt is one of the problems that tire my head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0522.mp3|i am awfully worried by problems|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0523.mp3|the world seems to be ruled by posters now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0524.mp3|people look to the hoardings for information about their duty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0531.mp3|who founded the aspiration club|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0534.mp3|and several other regular wednesday friends of mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0535.mp3|all interested in the occult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0536.mp3|it would be a real opportunity for you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0537.mp3|i am afraid you will be very angry with me said the witch presently in a hollow voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0539.mp3|i'm awfully sorry but it must have been a fluke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0540.mp3|i seem to have said so much last night without knowing it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0541.mp3|i'm afraid i was showing off a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0542.mp3|the painful tears of confession were in her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0544.mp3|changing the subject|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0545.mp3|do you live alone yes absolutely said miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0546.mp3|my friends call me a perfect hermit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0547.mp3|i hardly ever have visitors in my spare room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0548.mp3|it makes so much work for my three maids|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0549.mp3|i suppose you wouldn't care to divorce your three maids and come and live here suggested the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0550.mp3|i could of course cure you of the nerve storms you speak of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0551.mp3|or rather i could help you to have nerve storms all the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0552.mp3|without any stagnant grown upness in between|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0553.mp3|then you wouldn't notice the nerve storms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0554.mp3|this house is a sort of nursing home and college combined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0555.mp3|i'll read you the prospectus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0556.mp3|very amusing said miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0557.mp3|after waiting a minute to see if there was any more of the prospectus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0558.mp3|she had quite recovered herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0559.mp3|and was wearing the brisk acute expression that deceived her into claiming a sense of humour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0561.mp3|and why that discouragement of social intercourse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0562.mp3|i am afraid the average person of the class you cater for does not recognise the duty of social intercourse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0563.mp3|this house replied the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0564.mp3|caters for people who are outside averages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0565.mp3|the ferryman says that people who are content to be average are lowering the general standard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0567.mp3|the only guest up to now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0569.mp3|and may be a teeny bit drunk when she comes in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0570.mp3|she has gone to draw her money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0571.mp3|what sort of money asked miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0574.mp3|unmarried wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0575.mp3|the expression of miss ford's face tactfully wiped away this bald unfortunate statement from the surface of the conversation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0576.mp3|and how do you make your boarding house pay she asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0587.mp3|and i've no doubt she would come over and do the stairs thoroughly every tuesday night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0588.mp3|besides we have overalls in stock at only two and eleven three|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0589.mp3|oh i like your merry mood said miss ford laughing heartily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0590.mp3|you must remember to talk like that when you come to my wednesdays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0591.mp3|most of my friends are utter socialists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0592.mp3|and believe in bridging as far as possible the gulf between one class and another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0593.mp3|so you needn't feel shy or awkward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0594.mp3|the splashing of the ferry boat was once more heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0595.mp3|and then the shop quaked a little as a heavy foot alighted on the landing stage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0596.mp3|the ferryman was heard saying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0597.mp3|i don't know any party of that name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0598.mp3|but i believe the young woman at the shop can help you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0599.mp3|lady arabel higgins entered the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0601.mp3|and sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0606.mp3|and then lost the note|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0610.mp3|and he would come and show me the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0611.mp3|but i didn't wait for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0612.mp3|i wanted to talk to you about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0613.mp3|well i must truly be going interrupted sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0616.mp3|there is no need for any one to move on my account said lady arabel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0617.mp3|you all heard what angela said last night in her little address to the committee in the dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0618.mp3|i don't know why she addressed her remarks particularly at me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0620.mp3|there is no secret in the matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0621.mp3|of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0624.mp3|i cannot understand how you knew angela|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0626.mp3|she took up a thin captain biscuit and bit it absent mindedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0632.mp3|i know that i know it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0634.mp3|i always knew in my heart that my old worn out tag|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0636.mp3|didn't meet the case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0637.mp3|his way of disappearing and never explaining|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0640.mp3|doing the same as other boys|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0641.mp3|and that was when i saw him marching with hundreds of real boys|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0642.mp3|in nineteen fourteen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0643.mp3|it was the happiest day i ever had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0644.mp3|i thought after all that i had borne a real boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0647.mp3|as you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0649.mp3|couldn't even get his stripe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0650.mp3|poor darling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0651.mp3|he deserted twice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0652.mp3|pure absence of mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0653.mp3|it was always the same from a child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0655.mp3|and of course worse in the trenches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0656.mp3|why you know it all angela dear at least perhaps not quite all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0657.mp3|i should like to tell you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0660.mp3|my husband he is a doctor you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0662.mp3|he was often ill in london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0663.mp3|i said it was asthma|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0666.mp3|and pinehurst insisted on going west|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0667.mp3|i took the precaution of having a good nurse with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0669.mp3|and people's eyes had sucked all the secrets out of the horizon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0670.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0671.mp3|i like cape cod|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0672.mp3|but he said there was always a wall of sea round those flat wet places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0673.mp3|we stayed in a blacksmith's spare room on the desert of wyoming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0674.mp3|but even that horizon seemed a little higher than we|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0676.mp3|in a pink sunrise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0679.mp3|and might have been the rockies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0681.mp3|we climbed a little narrow track up a mountain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0690.mp3|a place with no horizon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0691.mp3|we looked between ragged pine trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0692.mp3|and saw over the shoulders of great old violet mountains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0693.mp3|we saw right down into the stars for ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0694.mp3|there was a tower of rocks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0696.mp3|sunny hot by day my dears and a great shelter by night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0698.mp3|the little dark clouds walk alone upon the mountain tops at sunset|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0699.mp3|as you said angela|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0701.mp3|and sometimes like faces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0702.mp3|and sometimes like the shadows of little bent gipsies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0703.mp3|i used to look at the mountains and think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0705.mp3|to be so worried and so small|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0707.mp3|standing just as we left them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0708.mp3|all by themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0709.mp3|under that unnatural moon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0710.mp3|it was an unnatural moon on the edge of the world there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0711.mp3|all by themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0712.mp3|with no watching eyes to spoil them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0713.mp3|as pinehurst used to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0714.mp3|not even one's own eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0718.mp3|born on an impossible day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0719.mp3|in an impossible place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0723.mp3|you'd have to know pinehurst really to understand it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0725.mp3|i can never forgive pinehurst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0726.mp3|you can never repay pinehurst said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0727.mp3|lady arabel did not seem to hear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0728.mp3|for a long time there was nothing to be heard but sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0729.mp3|murmuring to her dog david|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0730.mp3|you must excuse her and remember that she lived most utterly alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0731.mp3|she was locked inside herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0732.mp3|and the solitary barred window in her prison wall commanded only a view of the dog david|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0736.mp3|how odd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0737.mp3|i was just telling miss watkins about his power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0738.mp3|and how strongly she reminded me of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0739.mp3|do tell him to keep wednesday afternoon free|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0740.mp3|lady arabel ignoring miss ford by mistake said to the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0742.mp3|please said the witch instantly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0743.mp3|tact i repeat was a stranger to her so she added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0744.mp3|i will bring sarah brown too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0746.mp3|and then the mayor arrived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0747.mp3|the witch saw at once that there was some secret understanding between him and her that she did not understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0748.mp3|her magic escapades often left her in this position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0749.mp3|however she winked back hopefully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0750.mp3|but she was not a skilled winker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0752.mp3|even the dog david|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_02_benson_0753.mp3|saw her doing it and miss ford looked a little offended|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0000.mp3|mitten island is a place of fine weather|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0001.mp3|its air is always like stained glass between you and perfection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0002.mp3|always you will find in the happy ways of mitten island a confidence that the worst is left behind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0003.mp3|and that even the worst was not so very bad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0004.mp3|you can afford to remember the winter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0005.mp3|for even the winter was beautiful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0007.mp3|and it seems that always there was joy running quickly behind the storms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0008.mp3|joy looking with the sun through a tall window in a cloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0009.mp3|even the most dreadful curtain of a winter's day was always drawn up at sunset|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0010.mp3|its straight edge rose slowly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0011.mp3|disclosing flaming space|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0012.mp3|and the dramatic figures of the two island churches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0013.mp3|exulting and undying martyrs in the midst of flames|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0014.mp3|it is a place of fine weather|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0015.mp3|and this is a book of fine weather|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0016.mp3|a book written in spring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0017.mp3|i will not remember the winter and the rain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0018.mp3|it was the spring that brought sarah brown to mitten island|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0019.mp3|and the spring that first showed her magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0020.mp3|it was the spring that awoke her on her first morning in the house of living alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0021.mp3|she awoke because it was so beautiful outside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0022.mp3|and because there was a beautiful day coming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0023.mp3|you could see the day secretly making preparations behind a shining mist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0024.mp3|she heard a sound of breathless singing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0025.mp3|and the whipping of stirred grass in the garden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0028.mp3|now there is hardly anything but magic abroad before seven o'clock in the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0029.mp3|only the disciples of magic like getting their feet wet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0030.mp3|and being furiously happy on an empty stomach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0031.mp3|sarah brown went to her window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0033.mp3|there was a sky of that quiet design which suffices half a day unchanged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0034.mp3|a garden of quite a good many yards lay behind the house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0035.mp3|it contained no potatoes or anything useful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0036.mp3|only long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0037.mp3|very green grass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0039.mp3|and a witch dancing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0040.mp3|the extraordinary music to which she was dancing was partly the braying of a neighbouring donkey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0041.mp3|and partly her own erratic singing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0043.mp3|as you may imagine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0044.mp3|in a very far from grown up way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0045.mp3|rather like a baby that has thought of a new funny way of annoying its nana|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0048.mp3|like a child that inadvertently bursts into loud tuneless song|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0049.mp3|because it is morning and yet too early to get up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0050.mp3|a little wandering of the voice a little wandering of the feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0051.mp3|the may tree in the middle of the garden seemed to be her partner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0053.mp3|and that was the shadow of a grey squirrel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0054.mp3|watching the dancing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0055.mp3|the squirrel wore the same fur as the two and a half guinea young lady wears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0056.mp3|and sometimes it looked with a tilted head at the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0057.mp3|and sometimes it buried its face in its hands and sat for a while shaken with secret laughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0059.mp3|she laughed herself most of the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0060.mp3|she was wearing a mackintosh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0061.mp3|which was in itself rather funny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0062.mp3|but her feet were bare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0064.mp3|it was sarah brown's fellow lodger leaning from her window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0065.mp3|the squirrel rippled higher up the may tree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0066.mp3|the pleasure of the thing broke like an eggshell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0067.mp3|sarah brown turned back towards her bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0068.mp3|it was too early to get up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0069.mp3|it was too late to go to sleep again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0073.mp3|lay cold as a serpent to shock her feet if she returned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0074.mp3|besides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0075.mp3|the dog david was asleep on the middle of the counterpane|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0076.mp3|and she was too good a mother to wake him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0077.mp3|there are a good many things to do when you find yourself awake too early|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0078.mp3|it is said that some people sit up and darn their stockings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0079.mp3|but i refer now to ordinary people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0080.mp3|not to angels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0081.mp3|utterly resourceless people find themselves reduced to reading the penny stamps on yesterday's letters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0082.mp3|there is a good deal of food for thought on a penny stamp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0084.mp3|some people i know employ this morning leisure in scrubbing their consciences clean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0085.mp3|thus thriftily making room for the sins of the coming day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0086.mp3|but sarah brown's conscience was dreadfully receptive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0087.mp3|almost magnetic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0089.mp3|there were a few regrettable seconds in every minute she lived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0091.mp3|though she never enjoyed the compensations attached to a really considerable sin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0093.mp3|and when she was happy she always tried to forget it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0094.mp3|yet she was not without a good many very small and unessential resources for sleepless moments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0095.mp3|often she wrote vague comments on matters with which she was not familiar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0096.mp3|in an exercise book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0097.mp3|always eventually mislaid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0098.mp3|she would awake from dear and unspeakable dreams full of hope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0099.mp3|and tell herself stories about herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0100.mp3|trying on various lives and deaths like clothes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0101.mp3|the result was never likely enough even to laugh at|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0104.mp3|there was a knock upon her door and a voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0109.mp3|nor have i said sarah brown opening the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0110.mp3|but i can pawn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0117.mp3|i got me money paid yesterday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0121.mp3|in fact she was comfortably into her second|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0122.mp3|her voice was so beautiful that it almost made one shy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0123.mp3|but her choice of language|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0124.mp3|tending as it did in the other direction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0125.mp3|reassured one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0126.mp3|she had fine eyes of an absolute grey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0127.mp3|and dark hair parted in the middle and drawn down so as to make a triangle of a face which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0128.mp3|left to itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0129.mp3|would have been square|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0133.mp3|on the whole|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0134.mp3|she looked like the duckling of the story|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0136.mp3|she showed unnatural energy even in repose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0137.mp3|and lived as though she had a taxi waiting at the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0139.mp3|and then wished she had not asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0145.mp3|he worked harder when first conscious of being watched|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0146.mp3|but seeing that they intended to stay there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0147.mp3|on the top step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0148.mp3|he made this the excuse to disappear indolently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0149.mp3|leaving little heaps of dust on several of the lower steps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0151.mp3|when sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0152.mp3|in rather a loud dressing gown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0153.mp3|had taken her seat on the stairs beside her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0164.mp3|or else the stars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0165.mp3|or else the sunset|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0172.mp3|it was me only recreation so to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0179.mp3|there ain't never a penny put in the slot for the moonlight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0180.mp3|when you come to think of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0182.mp3|well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0184.mp3|i never spoke to a soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0196.mp3|rented the parlour floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0199.mp3|as for flowers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0205.mp3|all to ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0206.mp3|to pay what we owed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0209.mp3|runs away from the debt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0214.mp3|i'll pay it the very best i can|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0225.mp3|what you could see of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0235.mp3|not marbles it wasn't nor peg tops|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0237.mp3|i won't tell you what it was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0264.mp3|even germans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0267.mp3|children knows a lot in the brown borough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0270.mp3|i got to count on that boy no end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0331.mp3|a beautiful collection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0332.mp3|well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0341.mp3|i was frightened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0345.mp3|fought with each other every minute of their lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0358.mp3|like as if damnation was worth while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0416.mp3|the sea was like my sky at night come nearer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0417.mp3|come near enough to know better like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0422.mp3|more like a star|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0430.mp3|at least|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0433.mp3|like any other man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0446.mp3|gradually finding out the pretty and amusing ways of the creature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0454.mp3|for i was always more two people than one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0482.mp3|it's springtime now said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_03_benson_0487.mp3|so as i can never repay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0001.mp3|she had at the same time a half time profession which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0002.mp3|when she was well enough to follow it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0003.mp3|brought twenty shillings a week to her pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0004.mp3|she was in the habit of sitting every morning in a small office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0005.mp3|collecting evidence from charitable spies about the naughty poor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0008.mp3|writing it down very beautifully upon little cards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0010.mp3|sarah brown never thought about the theory of this work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0011.mp3|because the different coloured inks and the beautiful writing pleased her so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0012.mp3|there are people to whom a ream of virgin paper is an inspiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0015.mp3|in whose ears and before whose eyes the alphabet is like a poem or a prayer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0016.mp3|touch on stationery and you touched an insane spot in sarah brown's mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0019.mp3|in drawing dogs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0020.mp3|all looking one way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0021.mp3|with new pen nibs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0022.mp3|in giving advice in a hushed voice to connoisseur customers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0024.mp3|therefore sarah brown's hand had found ideal employment on a charity register|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0025.mp3|as for her mind it usually shut its eye during office hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0026.mp3|her dog david liked the work too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0027.mp3|as the hearth rug was a comfortable one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0028.mp3|and charity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0029.mp3|though it may suffer long in other directions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0030.mp3|is rather particular about its firing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0031.mp3|on the monday after her change of home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0033.mp3|and even a new consignment of index cards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0034.mp3|exquisitely unspotted from the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0035.mp3|failed to arouse her enthusiasm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0036.mp3|this was partly because the first name in the index that she looked up was that of watkins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0041.mp3|to ask for help and advice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0042.mp3|see full report|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0043.mp3|sarah brown felt sad and clumsy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0044.mp3|and made two blots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0045.mp3|one in green on the watkins card|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0047.mp3|chocolate box maker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0049.mp3|to whom a certain charity was obstinately giving a half pint of milk daily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0053.mp3|when the lady representing the obstinate charity came in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0054.mp3|her lips shaped to the word tonk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0056.mp3|late of mud street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0057.mp3|she has changed her address|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0058.mp3|i am the guild of happy hearts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0059.mp3|she still comes to fetch her half pint of milk daily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0061.mp3|it really is disgraceful the way these poor people conceal important facts from us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0063.mp3|but we have already notified you three times that the woman is not entitled to milk from the happy hearts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0064.mp3|as she has been having parish relief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0065.mp3|as well as an allotment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0068.mp3|hm said the happy heart delicately in an undertone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0069.mp3|so that the blushing masculine ear of the dog david might be spared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0072.mp3|really you oughtn't to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0073.mp3|tonk is posing as a single chocolate box maker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0074.mp3|sarah brown was rapidly becoming exasperated with everybody concerned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0075.mp3|but not least with the evidently camouflaging tonk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0076.mp3|she has a soldier at the front said the happy heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0078.mp3|even if he does come home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0079.mp3|but even so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0083.mp3|but that was not the last of tonk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0084.mp3|presently the red face of the relieving officer loomed over the index|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0086.mp3|in the case of tonk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0087.mp3|interrupted sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0089.mp3|in her present mood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0091.mp3|she hated the relieving officer unjustly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0092.mp3|because he knew she was deaf and raised his voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0093.mp3|with the best intentions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0094.mp3|to such a degree that the case papers on the index were occasionally blown away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0095.mp3|we have already notified you three times that tonk is having a half pint of milk daily from the happy hearts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0096.mp3|as well as an allotment from a soldier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0099.mp3|in the case of tonk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0100.mp3|persisted sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0101.mp3|she has moved from mud street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0103.mp3|somewhere on the outskirts of the district|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0104.mp3|mitten island i fancy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0107.mp3|she paying no rent now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0110.mp3|pulling his nose i hear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0112.mp3|the children came into the house this morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0113.mp3|what is tonk's christian name asked sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0114.mp3|who had been a changed woman since mitten island was mentioned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0116.mp3|some flower name i think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0117.mp3|probably lily or ivy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0119.mp3|the woman is said to have fallen through a hole in the floor of the room she and her three children slept in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0120.mp3|she was admitted into the infirmary last night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0122.mp3|it begins with p said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0124.mp3|the relieving officer went away for it was dinner time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0125.mp3|sarah brown absently unwrapped the little dinner which she had brought hanging by a thin string from a strangled finger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0130.mp3|but this morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0131.mp3|as she had taken her seat with david in the bouncing ferry boat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0132.mp3|there had been a panting rustling noise behind her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0133.mp3|and harold the broomstick had swept a little packet of sandwiches into her lap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0135.mp3|now i could not say with certainty whether the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0136.mp3|in making up this packet of sandwiches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0137.mp3|had included the contents of one of her own little packets of magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0139.mp3|her mind was always on the brink of innocent intoxication|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0140.mp3|perhaps she was only half a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0141.mp3|so that half a joy could make her heart reel and sing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0142.mp3|and half a sorrow break it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0143.mp3|she was defenceless against impressions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0144.mp3|and too many impressions make the heart very tired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0147.mp3|she was a predestined victim of magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0148.mp3|and it seems unlikely that the witch should have missed such an opportunity to dispense spells|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0149.mp3|after the first bite at the first sandwich|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0150.mp3|sarah brown was conscious of a joke somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0151.mp3|this feeling in itself was akin to delirium|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0152.mp3|for there are no two facts so remote as a joke and a charity society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0153.mp3|the office table confronted sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0156.mp3|the office clock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0157.mp3|alone among clocks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0158.mp3|had never played a practical joke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0159.mp3|the sad fire below it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0160.mp3|conscious of a mission|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0161.mp3|was overloaded with coal and responsibility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0162.mp3|the second bite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0163.mp3|ten minutes later|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0165.mp3|her eyes turned to seek the hidden joke beyond the limits of that lamentable room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0166.mp3|there was a spring coloured tree in the school ground opposite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0167.mp3|and above the tree a rough blue and silver sky contradicted all the doctrines preached in offices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0169.mp3|and penetrates inland only on rare spring days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0170.mp3|the high white clouds crossed the sky like galleons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0171.mp3|like old stories out of the innocent eden like past of the sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0173.mp3|old names of ships came to sarah brown's mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0174.mp3|castle of comfort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0177.mp3|she took a third bite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0178.mp3|and then she felt the spirit of the naughty poor in the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0179.mp3|there was laughter as of the registered in the ears of the registrar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0180.mp3|it is not really permissible for the naughty poor to invade offices which exist to do them good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0181.mp3|the way of charity lies through suspicion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0183.mp3|we have to judge the criminal unheard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0184.mp3|if we called him as a witness in his case we might become sentimental|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0185.mp3|the charity society may be imagined as keeping two lists of crimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0186.mp3|a short one for registrars and workers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0187.mp3|and a very long one for the registered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0188.mp3|high on the list of crimes possible to registrars and workers is sentimentality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0189.mp3|it is sentimental to feel personal affection for a case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0192.mp3|or to acknowledge the right of a case to ask questions sometimes instead of answering them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0194.mp3|or to believe any statement made by any one without an assured income|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0195.mp3|or to quote any part of the new testament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0196.mp3|or in fact to confuse in any way the ideas of charity and love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0199.mp3|by the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0200.mp3|unfortunately omitted to join any reputable philanthropic society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0201.mp3|commanded seekers of salvation to be poor and to despise themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0202.mp3|but this was sentimental|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0203.mp3|and the charity society decrees that only the prosperous and the self respectful shall deserve a hearing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0204.mp3|i am sentimental said sarah brown to her dog david in a broken voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0205.mp3|she turned again to her enchanted sandwich|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0206.mp3|there was increased laughter in the air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0207.mp3|and through it she heard the hoarse and happy shouting of the sparrows in the spring coloured tree opposite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0209.mp3|the begging friars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0212.mp3|with their mouths full of your crumbs they share with you their innocent and vulgar wit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0213.mp3|they give you in return no i o u|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0214.mp3|and no particulars for your case paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0215.mp3|when they have got from you all that you will give|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0216.mp3|they wink and giggle and shake the dust of your window sill from off their feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0217.mp3|sarah brown opened the office window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0219.mp3|she thought perhaps these were magic noises|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0220.mp3|for she heard them so clearly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0221.mp3|she broke her second sandwich upon the window sill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0222.mp3|and the sparrows crossed the street and stood on the area railing in a row below her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0223.mp3|all speaking at once in an effort to convey to her the fact that a retreat on her part would be tactful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0224.mp3|the sparrow obviously buys all his clothes ready made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0225.mp3|probably at jumble sales|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0226.mp3|and he always seems to choose clothes made for a stouter bird|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0228.mp3|he has a slimmer figure than the bullfinch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0230.mp3|who always manages to look so well tailored|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0231.mp3|it is just arrogance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0233.mp3|on the part of the sparrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0235.mp3|sarah brown retreated one step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0236.mp3|i'm not going farther away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0237.mp3|either you eat that sandwich with me looking on or you leave it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0238.mp3|the sparrows whispered together for a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0239.mp3|saying to each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0242.mp3|and were afraid sarah brown might intend to rebuke them for not shutting their beaks while chewing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0244.mp3|but after a minute one sparrow moistened his beak and came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0246.mp3|they all ate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0247.mp3|and did not seek to escape as the door of the office opened and the witch came in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0248.mp3|she went straight to the window and picked up from among the stooping sparrows a piece of the broken sandwich|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0250.mp3|the dog david was making sure that there was no surviving crumb on the floor to tell the tale of his mother's sentimental weakness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0253.mp3|that sandwich was but a memory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0254.mp3|a fading taste in about twenty beaks and two mouths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0255.mp3|but still the window stood open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0256.mp3|and the air danced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0258.mp3|sarah brown in the meanwhile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0259.mp3|disregarding the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0260.mp3|had returned to the index|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0261.mp3|and had taken from its drawer a notification form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0262.mp3|in the space given for name of case she had written in her irreproachable printing hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0264.mp3|with reference to the above case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0265.mp3|i have to report that it seems unsatisfactory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0266.mp3|there are indeed grave suspicions that the above name is only an alias|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0267.mp3|the address being also probably false|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0268.mp3|for the genuine charity's place of origin is said to be the home rather than the office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0269.mp3|the present registrar is at a loss to identify with certainty this case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0271.mp3|collecting kudos under assumed names|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0272.mp3|it puzzles me said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0273.mp3|looking out of the window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0274.mp3|why one never sees two birds collide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0275.mp3|if there were as many witches in the air as there are birds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0277.mp3|do you think they have any sort of a rule of the road|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0282.mp3|a little disappointed at being interrupted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0284.mp3|get on and say it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0285.mp3|the dog david|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0286.mp3|who was really a good and attentive son to sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0287.mp3|came and laid his chin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0288.mp3|with an exaggerated look of interest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0289.mp3|on her knee cap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0290.mp3|is it any use said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0291.mp3|fighting against the habits in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0292.mp3|there are so many|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0293.mp3|who set these strange and senseless deceivers at large|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0294.mp3|religion which has forgotten ecstasy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0295.mp3|law which has forgotten justice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0296.mp3|charity which has forgotten love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0299.mp3|magic generally suffered because it was so sane|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0300.mp3|i thought everybody knew that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0301.mp3|all habits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0302.mp3|all habits chanted sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0303.mp3|what is this charity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0304.mp3|this clinking of money between strangers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0309.mp3|how long do you want me to keep quiet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0310.mp3|while you say things that everybody surely knows but sarah brown went on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0311.mp3|the real love knows her neighbour face to face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0312.mp3|and laughs with him and weeps with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0313.mp3|and eats and drinks with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0315.mp3|when his black day dawns|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0316.mp3|she may share with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0318.mp3|but all that she has|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0319.mp3|the dog david grunted a little by way of rather dubious applause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0321.mp3|with her own voice printed loud and stark upon the retina of her hearing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0322.mp3|felt a little abashed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0323.mp3|but presently she added in a whisper listen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0325.mp3|i am a lover of specially recommended neighbours only|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0328.mp3|in the interest of the superfluously comfortable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0330.mp3|taking toll in bitterness and humiliation from every traveller along that road|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0331.mp3|for surely comfort is every man's heritage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0332.mp3|surely the happy years should come to every man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0334.mp3|not meanly dependent on his moral orthodoxy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0335.mp3|but as his right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0336.mp3|the fat philanthropist is a debtor but he behaves like a creditor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0337.mp3|he distributes obligations with his gold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0338.mp3|yet he has no right to the gold he gives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0339.mp3|he makes his brother beg upon his knees for the life and the health and the dear opportunity that should have been that brother's birthright|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0340.mp3|you are possessed dear sarah brown said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0341.mp3|don't be frightened it will soon pass off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0342.mp3|i knew a girl who had an attack very much like this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0343.mp3|while she was under its influence she made up a psalm pretty nearly as good as one of david's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0344.mp3|her mother was much alarmed about her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0345.mp3|but she recovered quite quickly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0347.mp3|sarah brown talked on louder and louder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0348.mp3|too long i have been a servant in the house of this stranger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0349.mp3|this greedy charity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0350.mp3|too long have i sat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0353.mp3|there is love and april outside the window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0354.mp3|there is too much wind and laughter outside to allow of the forming of habits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0355.mp3|i have seen love and the spring only through the glass of a charity office window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0357.mp3|the white ships|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0360.mp3|good god said sarah brown pushing david from her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0361.mp3|what has happened to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0362.mp3|i have become sentimental|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0363.mp3|the room seemed to her wild imagination to be full of the spirits of parsons and social workers with flaming swords|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0364.mp3|pointing at the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0365.mp3|well that's the end of that job said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0367.mp3|let's go and sit on the swing leg seat on the heath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0372.mp3|she had shared with david the remains of her sandwich of knowledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0373.mp3|she had left on the table her puny paper defiance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0374.mp3|david|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0375.mp3|except that he had required but little temptation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0376.mp3|had played adam's part very creditably in the affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0377.mp3|for him eden had been a soft warm place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0378.mp3|and he was anxious to blame somebody|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0379.mp3|the woman for choice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0380.mp3|for the loss of his comfort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0381.mp3|he followed her out into the cold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0382.mp3|to become|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0383.mp3|as you shall hear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_04_benson_0385.mp3|a tiller of the soil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0001.mp3|while seldom actually conspicuous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0002.mp3|it seems to have a mysterious and varying effect on the surrounding public|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0003.mp3|i have met travellers by tube who tell of strange doings in those regions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0004.mp3|when the conductor of one compartment fell suddenly in love with the conductress of the next|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0005.mp3|and they ran to each other and met in the middle of the car|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0006.mp3|as nobody opened the gates or rang the bells|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0007.mp3|the bewildered train stood for hours at mornington crescent before any member of the watching public could find the heart to interrupt the pretty scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0008.mp3|it is patent that a magic person must have been the more or less deliberate cause of this episode|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0009.mp3|then again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0012.mp3|it got the idea that the kindly public was its enemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0013.mp3|you should have seen the astonishment of liverpool street and the bank as it rushed by them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0014.mp3|old ladies about to ask it whether it went to clapham|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0016.mp3|stood aghast and their questions died on their lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0017.mp3|policemen put up their hands against it it ran over them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0019.mp3|you will hardly believe me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0022.mp3|and nelson reeled where he stood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0023.mp3|i don't know where it went to that day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0026.mp3|its sides heaving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0028.mp3|its windows streaming with perspiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0029.mp3|and a great bruise on its forehead where a chance bomb had struck it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0030.mp3|i believe the poor thing had to be put out of its misery in the end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0031.mp3|and what was the reason of all this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0032.mp3|it was found that a wizard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0033.mp3|called innocent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0034.mp3|of stoke newington|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0035.mp3|had been asleep on the top all the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0037.mp3|on his return from the city|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0039.mp3|on the night of lady arabel's supper party|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0041.mp3|but she was spared to a merciful extent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0043.mp3|except that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0044.mp3|as they crossed the canal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0051.mp3|lady arabel herself opened it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0053.mp3|all our servants are gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0055.mp3|the tactful sarah brown nudged the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0056.mp3|better not stay she murmured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0057.mp3|of course we'll stay replied the witch loudly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0058.mp3|i'm horribly hungry and there's sure to be some supper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0059.mp3|certainly there is added lady arabel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0060.mp3|i cooked it myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0062.mp3|i've never seen a cookery book before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0066.mp3|i should think two small zeppelins could have danced a minuet under its dome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0067.mp3|sarah brown and the witch put on their cathedral look at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0068.mp3|by mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0069.mp3|and propping their chins upon their umbrellas gazed reverently upward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0071.mp3|the fourth footman was the last to go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0072.mp3|he said even the army would be better than this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0073.mp3|he liked spooks he said at second hand but not otherwise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0075.mp3|i'm glad to say the orchestra has stayed with us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0079.mp3|sarah brown and the witch were left in a small room that opened on to the great hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0080.mp3|it was furnished rather like a lodging house parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0082.mp3|flanked on each side by a china boot in pink|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0083.mp3|with real bootlaces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0084.mp3|and a pig looking out of the top of each|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0085.mp3|there were pictures on the walls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0086.mp3|mostly representing young ladies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0087.mp3|more or less obviously in love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0088.mp3|supported by rustic properties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0089.mp3|i have noticed that the girl's first love is the monopoly of the victorian painter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0091.mp3|but i do not know the reason of this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0093.mp3|he would have been very obviously a wizard even without the thunder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0094.mp3|and seemed much less innocent about his magic than the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0095.mp3|he had pale hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0096.mp3|a pale face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0097.mp3|and eyes that did not open wide without a certain effort on the part of the brows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0099.mp3|i admire them awfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0100.mp3|i don't like really clever art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0101.mp3|do you know it makes me sneeze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0102.mp3|directly he spoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0103.mp3|one saw that he was making the usual effort of magic to appear real|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0104.mp3|witches and wizards lead difficult lives because they have no ancestry working within them to prompt them in the little details|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0105.mp3|whenever you see a person being unusually grown up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0106.mp3|suspect them of magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0107.mp3|you can always notice witches and wizards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0109.mp3|after eight o'clock at night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0110.mp3|pretending that they are not proud of sitting up late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0115.mp3|this picture added richard seems to me very beautiful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0116.mp3|the picture might have cost a shilling originally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0117.mp3|framed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0118.mp3|or it might have been attached to a calendar once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0120.mp3|there was a river and waterfall like well combed hair in the middle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0121.mp3|and a dozen leaden mountains lying about with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0123.mp3|pocket handkerchiefs on their tops|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0125.mp3|i can't imagine insisted richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0126.mp3|that there could be a more beautiful picture than that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0127.mp3|but perhaps it appeals to me specially because father and mother and i so often talk about the place together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0128.mp3|the place like that near to the mountain where i was born|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0132.mp3|i dream of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0133.mp3|with milky green water running under and over and round the most extraordinary shapes of ice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0134.mp3|and cactuses like green hedgehogs in the crevices of the rocks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0135.mp3|and great untidy pine trees clinging to an ounce of earth on an inch of flat surface|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0136.mp3|and the rocks are a most splendid rose red|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0138.mp3|and break out into shapes that are so deliberate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0139.mp3|they look as if they must mean something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0140.mp3|indeed they do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0143.mp3|as they returned to the hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0144.mp3|a burst of earnest music from the whole orchestra partially drowned the clap of thunder that again marked richard's passage through the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0145.mp3|sarah brown felt sure that lady arabel arranged this on purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0146.mp3|the wizard's mother obviously had great difficulty in not noticing the phenomena connected with her son|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0147.mp3|and she wore a striving smile and a look of glassy and well bred unconsciousness whenever anything magic happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0148.mp3|at the end of the hall the orchestra|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0149.mp3|arranged neatly in a crescent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0151.mp3|this mania spread until even the outlying bassoons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0154.mp3|a piercing note of command|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0156.mp3|from a clarinet caused a devastating dumbness to fall suddenly on every instrument except the piano|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0157.mp3|which continued self consciously alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0158.mp3|the pianist looked at the ceiling mostly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0159.mp3|but one note seemed to be an especial favourite with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0160.mp3|and whenever he played it he looked closely and paternally at it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0161.mp3|almost indeed applying his nose to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0162.mp3|all at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0163.mp3|just as sarah brown was beginning to imagine that she could catch the tune and the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0164.mp3|the music ceased|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0165.mp3|apparently in the middle of a bar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0166.mp3|richard sneezed once or twice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0167.mp3|that unsophisticated wizard was evidently enjoying himself in the practice of his art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0168.mp3|one felt that magic was not encouraged in the army|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0169.mp3|and that the supernatural orgy in which he was now indulging was the accumulated reaction after long self control|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0170.mp3|strange noises of unnatural laughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0171.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0172.mp3|proceeded from distant corners of the hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0173.mp3|and each of the electric lights in turn winked facetiously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0174.mp3|the string of the double bass broke loudly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0175.mp3|and the new string which its devotee laboriously inserted also broke at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0176.mp3|the performer looked appealingly at lady arabel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0177.mp3|but she refrained from meeting his eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0178.mp3|a blizzard of butterflies enveloped the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0179.mp3|this was evidently rather a difficult trick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0180.mp3|for the spell collapsed repeatedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0181.mp3|and from one second to another sarah brown was never quite sure whether there were really purple admirals drowning in her soup or not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0182.mp3|you are so lucky sighed the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0183.mp3|plenty of room and every facility|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0184.mp3|i myself am so dreadfully cramped and hampered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0185.mp3|i often have to boil my incantations over a spirit lamp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0186.mp3|and even that is becoming difficult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0188.mp3|not really lucky said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0190.mp3|and that's why i never got my stripe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0192.mp3|i once did a little stunt with the sergeant's cigarette|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0193.mp3|it grew suddenly longer as he struck a match to light it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0194.mp3|and went on growing till he had to ask me to light it for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0196.mp3|of course he couldn't really bring the thing home to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0197.mp3|but somehow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0198.mp3|well as i say i never got my stripe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0199.mp3|to this discussion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0200.mp3|and indeed to all the enchantments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0201.mp3|lady arabel paid no attention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0202.mp3|but continued to talk a little nervously on very insipid subjects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0203.mp3|her eyes had the pathetic look often seen in stupid people's eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0204.mp3|the don't listen to me look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0206.mp3|the real me is better than this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0207.mp3|finally richard indulged in a trick that was evidently a stock joke among magic people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0208.mp3|for the witch laughed directly it began|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0209.mp3|just as the hostess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0210.mp3|with poised fork and spoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0212.mp3|the round table began to spin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0214.mp3|the table continued to spin for a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0215.mp3|with a deep thrilling organ sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0216.mp3|and when it stopped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0218.mp3|he distributed them gravely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0219.mp3|lady arabel turned scarlet and murmured to sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0221.mp3|sarah brown took pity on her and began talking at random|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0222.mp3|the orchestra was busy again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0223.mp3|and to the tune of a loud elusive rag time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0224.mp3|she shouted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0225.mp3|do you know i gave my job the sack this morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0227.mp3|that's counting a box of oxo cubes i have by me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0228.mp3|you don't happen to know of a suitable job|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0232.mp3|my dear said lady arabel instantly motherly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0234.mp3|i wish i knew of something suitable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0236.mp3|war time you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0237.mp3|i'm afraid i shan't be justified in keeping on the orchestra|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0238.mp3|certainly not in adding to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0241.mp3|although women are simply too splendid nowadays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0242.mp3|don't you think the big drum|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0244.mp3|however are you clever asked richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0245.mp3|yes she is said the witch proudly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0246.mp3|she writes minor poetry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0247.mp3|i saw a bit by her in a magazine that had no pictures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0251.mp3|but somehow i couldn't make it fit in with the two articles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0252.mp3|that worried me a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0253.mp3|if you'd try your best not to be clever i'd give you a job said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0254.mp3|who with a rather tiresome persistence was now levitating the chicken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0255.mp3|so that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0256.mp3|invisibly suspended at a height of eighteen inches above the middle of the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0257.mp3|it dripped gravy into a bowl of daffodils|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0258.mp3|in fact i will give you a job|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0259.mp3|i have a farm called higgins farm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0260.mp3|just about half way between sea level and sky level|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0261.mp3|you can be a hand if you like at sixpence an hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0262.mp3|you can get there from mitten island every day quite easily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0263.mp3|and i'll tell you how|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0266.mp3|you follow the green ride through the enchanted forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0267.mp3|until you come to the castle where the youngest prince|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0269.mp3|used to live|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0272.mp3|just got his battery i believe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0274.mp3|and that leads you straight to the gate of higgins farm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0275.mp3|under a clipped box archway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0276.mp3|i haven't got a land outfit said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0277.mp3|but i saw a pair called mesopotamian officer's model|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0278.mp3|with laces and real white buckskin collision mats between the knees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0279.mp3|that would fit me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0280.mp3|and i can pawn my|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0281.mp3|at that moment there was a loud report|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0283.mp3|but all his strings were for the moment intact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0284.mp3|a maroon said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0285.mp3|my dears exclaimed lady arabel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0286.mp3|much relieved to hear that this new sensation was not supernatural|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0288.mp3|do you know i promised pinehurst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0289.mp3|my husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0290.mp3|never to remain in this house during an air raid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0291.mp3|it was his own fault the dear thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0292.mp3|he had a craze for windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0295.mp3|and pinehurst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0296.mp3|in his spare time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0297.mp3|used always to be making plans for squeezing in more windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0300.mp3|and i'm sure you won't mind coming too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0303.mp3|but i'm afraid the vicar wouldn't like it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0305.mp3|we must wait for the end of this piece the first violin is so touchy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0307.mp3|it was a plain uneventful piece|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0309.mp3|a thing that puzzles me said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0310.mp3|taking advantage of an emotional pause while one violin was wheezing a very long small note by itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0311.mp3|is why only ugly songs are really persistent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0315.mp3|or a cat on the wall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0317.mp3|will give their services most generously for hours on end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0319.mp3|or a nightingale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0320.mp3|or a fairy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0321.mp3|she was interrupted by a scuffling sound in the umbrella stand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0323.mp3|after a moment's rather embarrassing entanglement with a butterfly net|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0324.mp3|approached|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0325.mp3|panting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0326.mp3|i must go said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0328.mp3|sarah brown i'll come back and fetch you when it's all over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0329.mp3|lady arabel and sarah brown crossed the road to the church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0330.mp3|richard following a few yards behind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0331.mp3|i'm afraid my little dinner party wasn't a great success said lady arabel confidentially|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0336.mp3|all boys are like that for the first few hours of their leave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0337.mp3|he is naturally of a quiet disposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0338.mp3|though you wouldn't think it from to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0339.mp3|there was a distant blot of gunfire on the air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0340.mp3|just as they reached the door of the crypt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0341.mp3|the very stout dog of the vicar are not all reverend dogs fat was waiting there with a bored look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0342.mp3|the vicar allows no animals inside the crypt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0345.mp3|i was here once when the vicar's youngest son brought in a rabbit under his coat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0347.mp3|that district of london happened to be rather a courageous one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0348.mp3|the inhabitants felt that if the war had to be brought home to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0349.mp3|common politeness dictated that it should find them at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0350.mp3|there were not more than a dozen people in the crypt therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0353.mp3|the vicar was trying to press comfort upon them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0354.mp3|but without much success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0355.mp3|for they were all quite content|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0356.mp3|discussing the deaths in their families|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0357.mp3|the noise of gunfire was coming nearer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0359.mp3|sarah brown concentrated on an evening newspaper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0360.mp3|busily reading again and again one of those columns of confidential man to man advertisement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0363.mp3|and she looked at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0364.mp3|he was sitting next to his mother on a stone step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0365.mp3|he seemed to be in a quieter mood and attempted no manifestation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0368.mp3|and indeed he presently said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0369.mp3|i say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0372.mp3|opposite to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0373.mp3|on two campstools|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0374.mp3|sat a young bridling mother of fifty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0375.mp3|with her old hard daughter of sixteen or so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0376.mp3|hard was that daughter in every way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0377.mp3|you would have counted her age in winters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0378.mp3|not in summers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0379.mp3|so obviously untender were her years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0381.mp3|her feet and ankles made the campstool on which she sat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0382.mp3|looking pathetically ethereal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0383.mp3|of such stuff as this is the backbone of england made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0384.mp3|which is perhaps why the backbone of england sometimes seems so sadly inflexible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0385.mp3|there was a screeching noise outside followed by an incredible crash|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0386.mp3|it seemed to cleave a bottomless abyss between one second and the next|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0387.mp3|so that one seemed to be conscious for the first time in an astonished and astonishing world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0388.mp3|lady arabel said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0389.mp3|boys will be boys|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0391.mp3|but really this is going a little too far|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0392.mp3|pinehurst's one hobby was his windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0394.mp3|the villains she said kittenishly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0395.mp3|aiming at places of worship as usual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0397.mp3|mary darling i don't believe you turned a hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0399.mp3|one could easily see that she was beloved at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0400.mp3|and one wondered why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0401.mp3|the sound of the guns seemed only a negative form of sound after the bomb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0402.mp3|and clearly above the firing could be heard a howl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0403.mp3|the vicar's dog still howling ran into the crypt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0404.mp3|rupert said the vicar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0405.mp3|in a terrible voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0406.mp3|interrupting himself in the middle of a cheering platitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0407.mp3|but he had no time to say anything more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0408.mp3|for behind rupert came a procession of perhaps a dozen people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0409.mp3|all dressed in sheets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0410.mp3|everybody saw at one pitiful glance that these were unfortunate householders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0411.mp3|so suddenly roused from oblivion as to forget all their ordinary suburban dignity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0412.mp3|probably barely escaping from ruined homes with their lives and a sheet each|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0413.mp3|there was a very old man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0414.mp3|a middle aged spinster|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0415.mp3|and then an enormous group of children of ages varying from two months to twenty years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0416.mp3|followed by their parents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0420.mp3|and one of the old ladies on the other side of the crypt suddenly threw down her knitting and began confessing her sins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0426.mp3|this is indeed a solemn moment said the sheeted spinster sitting down beside lady arabel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0427.mp3|i hope i am meeting it in a proper spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0430.mp3|i have learned my statement by heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0431.mp3|what statement asked lady arabel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0432.mp3|who was rather deeply engrossed in turning the heel of the sock she was knitting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0433.mp3|the statement i shall make when the sheep are divided from the goats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0435.mp3|things are not so bad as that surely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0437.mp3|you mistake me said the sheeted lady bridling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0438.mp3|there is i am confident no cause whatever for pessimism on my part|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0439.mp3|i have no misgivings as to the verdict|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0441.mp3|i thought it best to learn my statement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0443.mp3|by heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0444.mp3|the old knitter had been rather annoyed to find her confession interrupted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0450.mp3|at this solemn moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0452.mp3|all my life i have made it an unalterable rule never to make a statement without first asking myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0453.mp3|is it true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0454.mp3|is it just|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0455.mp3|is it kind you may well say so replied lady arabel pleasantly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0456.mp3|i only wish the younger generation would follow your example|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0457.mp3|nowadays it is much more likely to be is it true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0458.mp3|no is it just|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0460.mp3|no is it funny|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0461.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0462.mp3|and out it comes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0463.mp3|be that as it may said the ladylike creature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0464.mp3|one could see she was a real lady even through the sheet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0465.mp3|obviously she read the morning post daily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0466.mp3|be that as it may|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0467.mp3|perhaps you can help me in one little matter which is intriguing me slightly even at this solemn moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0468.mp3|do you suppose the sheep will be allowed to hear the trial of the goats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0469.mp3|or will the court be cleared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0473.mp3|please said lady arabel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0475.mp3|don't let your mind dwell on the worst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0476.mp3|i assure you that you will be all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0477.mp3|of course i shall be all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0478.mp3|as you put it said the elderly lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0479.mp3|coldly drawing herself up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0480.mp3|everybody can be my witness that i have kept my candle burning in my small corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0482.mp3|a candle burning to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0483.mp3|and probably unshaded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0484.mp3|don't you know that those fiends in the sky are always on the watch for the slightest illumination fiends in the sky exclaimed the sheeted lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0486.mp3|don't talk such rot implored the hard flapper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0487.mp3|who the dickens do you suppose was responsible for that crash responsible for the crash said the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0488.mp3|whose tones were becoming more and more alive with exclamation marks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0489.mp3|is then the solemn work of summoning us entrusted to the minions of the evil one a series of crashes interrupted her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0490.mp3|the work of the adjacent gun|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0491.mp3|the earth shook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0495.mp3|but still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0496.mp3|one cannot be too careful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0497.mp3|and some people are heavy sleepers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0498.mp3|i heard the first myself without any possibility of mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0499.mp3|and rose at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0500.mp3|though the slab lay heavy on my chest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0502.mp3|to touch that sort of thing late at night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0504.mp3|sarah brown happened to look at richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0505.mp3|his eyes were shut|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0506.mp3|but he was smiling very broadly with tight lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0507.mp3|and his face was turned towards the ceiling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0508.mp3|his fingers were very tense and busy on his lap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0510.mp3|but her study of him was interrupted by the loud denouncing voice of the very venerable man who had led the procession of late comers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0511.mp3|a dog in this hallowed place he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0512.mp3|pointing at the deeply disconcerted rupert who was weaving himself nervously in and out of his master's legs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0514.mp3|gently gently my dear sir protested the vicar a little roused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0515.mp3|i am the minister of this church and the dog is mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0516.mp3|i was indeed about to turn it out when you entered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0517.mp3|after which i lost sight of it for a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0518.mp3|rupert go home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0519.mp3|rupert howled again and lay down as if about to faint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0520.mp3|forty years have i been vicar of this parish said the veteran|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0521.mp3|and never|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0522.mp3|what interrupted the vicar forty years vicar of this parish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0525.mp3|i always understood that he passed away quite ten years ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0526.mp3|he approached the old man and strove to button hole him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0527.mp3|the sheet at first foiled him in this intention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0528.mp3|but he presently contented himself with seizing a little corner of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0529.mp3|by which he led his aged brother vicar into a corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0530.mp3|there they could be heard for some time misunderstanding each other in low earnest tones|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0536.mp3|sarah brown was becoming sleepy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0537.mp3|a blankness was invading her mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0538.mp3|and the talk in the crypt seemed to lose its meaning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0540.mp3|she pondered idly on the family of children with their elders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0542.mp3|it was a group whose relationships were difficult to make out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0543.mp3|the ages of many of the children being unnaturally approximate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0544.mp3|there seemed to be at least seven children under three years old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0545.mp3|and yet they all bore a strong and regrettable family likeness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0546.mp3|several of the babies would hardly have been given credit for having reached walking age|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0547.mp3|yet none had been carried in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0548.mp3|the woman who seemed to imagine herself the mother of this rabble was distributing what looked like hurried final words of advice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0549.mp3|the father with a pensive eye was obviously trying to remember their names|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0550.mp3|and at intervals whispering to a man apparently twenty years his senior|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0552.mp3|it was all very confusing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0553.mp3|a long dim stretch of time seemed to have passed when suddenly the note of a bugle sprang out across space|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0554.mp3|somehow the air at once felt cooler and more wholesome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0556.mp3|lighting up a crouching whipped world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0560.mp3|i was just wondering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0561.mp3|but at that moment the two vicars approached|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0562.mp3|and the elder one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0563.mp3|including both the spinster and the mysterious family in one glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0564.mp3|spoke in a clerical yet embarrassed voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0565.mp3|dear friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0566.mp3|a slight but inconvenient mistake has occurred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0567.mp3|and i am afraid i must ask you to submit blindly to my guidance in a matter strangely difficult to explain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0569.mp3|myself in much confusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0571.mp3|it would be out of place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0572.mp3|the spinster interrupted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0574.mp3|by the way she did it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0575.mp3|one saw that she was chapel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0580.mp3|you overrate the solemnity of the moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0581.mp3|i must earnestly ask you all to return with me to the places whence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0582.mp3|labouring under an extraordinary error|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0583.mp3|we came to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0585.mp3|parachute trusts me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0586.mp3|and is prepared to lead her little flock to rest again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0590.mp3|much ruffled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0591.mp3|as she gathered her sheet about her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0593.mp3|parachute did not call|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0594.mp3|she bowed to lady arabel and became satirical even arch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0597.mp3|i am assured that the moment is not solemn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0598.mp3|and therefore solemn it shall not be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0599.mp3|to turn to lighter subjects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0600.mp3|i hope i shall have the pleasure of meeting you and your delightful son and daughter again at no distant date|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0604.mp3|perhaps my slab just outside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0605.mp3|very superior granite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0606.mp3|would do as a substitute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0607.mp3|the pale party filed out of the crypt and disappeared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0608.mp3|the remaining vicar smote his brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0609.mp3|and addressed the now calm rupert in a low voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0610.mp3|but with such unaccountable warmth that that harassed animal disappeared precipitately in the direction of his home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0611.mp3|lady arabel sarah brown and richard crossed the churchyard together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_05_benson_0612.mp3|oh my dears look said lady arabel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0000.mp3|the moonlight lay like cream upon the pavement when the witch and harold her broomstick left the higgins' doorstep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0002.mp3|unblotted by people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0003.mp3|there was a hint of pale green about the moonlight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0005.mp3|the witch mounted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0006.mp3|harold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0007.mp3|who was every inch a thoroughbred and very highly strung|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0008.mp3|trembled beneath her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0009.mp3|but not with fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0011.mp3|and flashed across it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0014.mp3|and he reared and shot upwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0015.mp3|narrowly missing the statue of one in a bus catching attitude|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0016.mp3|which marks the middle of the circus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0017.mp3|as soon as the witch had out distanced the noise of expectant london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0018.mp3|she heard quite distinctly the approach of london's guests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0019.mp3|they came with a chorus of many notes all deep and dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0020.mp3|there were a few clouds wandering about among the stars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0022.mp3|a cloud gives quite reasonable support to magic people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0023.mp3|and most witches and wizards have discovered the delight of paddling knee deep about those quicksilver continents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0024.mp3|they wander along shining and changing valleys under a most ardent sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0026.mp3|or launch the first snowflake of a blizzard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0027.mp3|they spring from pink stepping stone to pink stepping stone of clouds each no bigger than a baby's hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0028.mp3|across great sunsets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0029.mp3|often when in london i am battling with a barrage of rain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0030.mp3|or falling over unseen strangers into gutters during fogs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0031.mp3|i think happily of the sunlit roof of cloud above my head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0032.mp3|and of the witches and wizards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0033.mp3|lying on their backs with their coats off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0034.mp3|among cloud meadows in a glory of perfect summer and sun|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0037.mp3|lay on her front on the cloud she had chosen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0038.mp3|and looked down through a little hole in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0039.mp3|it was practically the only cloud present that would have afforded reasonable cover|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0041.mp3|there was a greater chorus of aeroplanes below her now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0042.mp3|the whole sky was ringing with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0043.mp3|the witch could hear a deep bass voiced machine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0045.mp3|a quavering tenor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0049.mp3|another witch said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0052.mp3|the guns were shouting now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0053.mp3|and the shells wailed and burst not so very far below them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0054.mp3|but harold trembled no longer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0055.mp3|more quickly than a falling star he swooped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0056.mp3|and in a second the alien witch was in sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0058.mp3|probably owing to the long distance flight and to the fourteen stone of teutonic magic on its back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0059.mp3|there was a wicked looking apparatus attached to the collar of the german broomstick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0060.mp3|obviously designed to squirt unpleasant enchantments downward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0061.mp3|this contrivance was apparently giving some trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0062.mp3|for the german was so busy attending to it that at first she did not see or hear the approach of harold and his rider|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0063.mp3|she was aroused to her danger by a heavy chunk of magic which struck and nearly unseated her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0066.mp3|she was ready with a parrying enchantment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0067.mp3|and the fight began|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0068.mp3|the two broomsticks reared and circled round each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0069.mp3|and over and under each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0071.mp3|and incantations of such potency were exchanged that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0072.mp3|i am told|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0073.mp3|the tiles and chimney pots of the streets below suffered a good deal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0075.mp3|till the very spaces went mad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0076.mp3|and london seemed to rush down nightmare slopes into a stormy sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0077.mp3|while its lights swung from pole to pole and were entangled with the stars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0078.mp3|both broomsticks were by now so uproariously excited that neither witch was able to aim her magic missiles very carefully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0079.mp3|and indeed it was not long before harold passed entirely beyond control|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0080.mp3|after bucking violently once or twice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0081.mp3|he gave a wild high cry that was like the wind howling through the fierce forest past of his race|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0082.mp3|and fell upon the other broomstick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0083.mp3|fixing his bristles into its throat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0084.mp3|the shock of the collision was too much for both witches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0086.mp3|if i may call her so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0088.mp3|and landed on the ample breast of her adversary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0091.mp3|lost her balance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0092.mp3|they fell together into space|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0096.mp3|and old safe years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0099.mp3|she had time to remember the blue ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0100.mp3|dimpled and starred with sunlight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0101.mp3|and the way the bees pulled over the bluebells and swung on them to the tune of cuckoos in a may mist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0102.mp3|she had time to think of the green globe ghosts of the bluebells that haunted the wood after the spring was dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0104.mp3|and it was some time before she noticed how slowly she and her enemy were falling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0105.mp3|for they were locked together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0108.mp3|which was german field grey instead of red|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0109.mp3|was spread out like a parachute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0110.mp3|and was supporting them upon their peaceful and almost affectionate descent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0111.mp3|for all i know they might have alighted gently in the strand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0112.mp3|and the authorities might by now be regretting the capture of a most embarrassing and unaccountable prisoner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0113.mp3|but something intervened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0114.mp3|the cloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0115.mp3|like a sheep suffering from the lack of other sheep to follow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0116.mp3|had not yet quitted the scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0118.mp3|and it had ended several hundred feet above the level of the cloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0119.mp3|which was apparently sinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0121.mp3|and they found themselves still interlocked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0122.mp3|prostrate and embedded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0123.mp3|with their eyes and mouths full of woolly wisps of cloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0124.mp3|our witch was the first to recover herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0125.mp3|she stood up and brushed herself remarking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0126.mp3|by jove that parachute cloak of yours is a great dodge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0127.mp3|i wish i'd thought of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0130.mp3|and a few lengths of whalebone would have done the trick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0131.mp3|the german was an older woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0132.mp3|and less adaptable to the strange chances of war|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0133.mp3|she was silent for a few minutes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0134.mp3|seated in the small crater made in the cloud by her fall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0135.mp3|she was not exactly ugly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0136.mp3|she had the sort of face about which one could not help feeling that one could have done it better oneself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0137.mp3|or at least that one could have taken more trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0143.mp3|in the serpentine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0144.mp3|and her round head was therefore disclosed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0146.mp3|the witches faced each other for some seconds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0147.mp3|a long way away they could hear the spitting and crackling sound of the two broomsticks fighting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0149.mp3|they could see the combatants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0150.mp3|like black comets in collision|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0152.mp3|who had good sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0155.mp3|their bristles were interlocked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0156.mp3|one twig floated down between the witches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0159.mp3|for this purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0160.mp3|she brought her eyes to her immediate surroundings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0161.mp3|it seemed to her suddenly that the sky was growing larger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0163.mp3|the edges of the cloud were dissolving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0164.mp3|she saw at last her peril and her disadvantage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0165.mp3|if harold should be killed or disabled she could never reach the earth again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0166.mp3|except by means of a fatal fall of several thousand feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0168.mp3|with her ingenious cloak contrivance strapped securely about her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0169.mp3|stood a reasonable chance of escape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0170.mp3|but our witch was an amateur in war|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0171.mp3|she was without support|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0174.mp3|magic as you know has limitations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0175.mp3|fire is of course a plaything in magic hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0176.mp3|water has its docile moments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0177.mp3|the earth herself may be tampered with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0178.mp3|and an incantation may call man or any of his possessions to attention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0179.mp3|but space is too great a thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0180.mp3|space is the inconceivable hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0181.mp3|holding aloft this fragile delusion that is our world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0182.mp3|there is no power that can mock at space|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0183.mp3|there is no enchantment that is not lost between us and the moon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0184.mp3|and all magic people know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0185.mp3|and tremble to know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0186.mp3|that in a breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0187.mp3|between one second and another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0188.mp3|that hand may close|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0189.mp3|and the shell of time first crack and then be crushed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0190.mp3|and magic be one with nothingness and death and all other delusions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0192.mp3|which treats the other elements as its servants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0194.mp3|and has to call such a purely independent contrivance as a broomstick to its help in the matter of air travel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0195.mp3|the witches faced each other on their little unstable sanctuary in the kingdom of space|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0196.mp3|our witch felt secretly sick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0197.mp3|and at the same time she tore fear from her mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0198.mp3|and knew that death was but an imperfectly kept secret|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0199.mp3|and that not an evil one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0200.mp3|after all we have condemned it unheard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0201.mp3|both witches could talk a magic tongue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0202.mp3|and make themselves mutually understood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0203.mp3|neither knew the other's natural tongue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0206.mp3|by means of magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0207.mp3|to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0210.mp3|what are you crying for i am not crying replied the german witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0212.mp3|certainly i am not crying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0215.mp3|this is england you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0216.mp3|england hasn't done anything accursed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0218.mp3|evidently pleased to meet someone to whom this information was fresh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0224.mp3|she was forgetting her danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0225.mp3|this is really rather funny she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0226.mp3|do you know what's happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0227.mp3|you've been reading the daily mail and misunderstanding it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0228.mp3|the whole of that quotation applied to germany not england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0229.mp3|it's germany that's being naughty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0230.mp3|you made a mistake but never mind i won't repeat it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0231.mp3|the german took no notice of this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0232.mp3|the past three years had made her an adept in taking no notice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0233.mp3|and now she added|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0235.mp3|and long distance broomstick practice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0236.mp3|and of parachute practice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0237.mp3|and of conflict with narrow officialdom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0238.mp3|i have come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0244.mp3|with no enemy at my mercy but a paltry and treacherous non combatant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0246.mp3|she looked up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0247.mp3|the broomsticks were closer now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0248.mp3|and through the breathless air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0249.mp3|amidst the dream like firing of the guns below|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0251.mp3|still fighting bravely but with hardly a twig on his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0252.mp3|the tide of space was coming in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0253.mp3|the edge of the cloud was barely six inches from her hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0255.mp3|it seemed that all her life she had been living on a narrowing shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0256.mp3|she remembered all her dawns as precarious footholds of peace on a threatened rock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0257.mp3|and all her evenings as golden sands sloping down into encroaching sleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0259.mp3|she clutched a pinch of cloud nervously and it broke off in her hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0260.mp3|she recalled her senses with a devastating effort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0261.mp3|do you mean to say she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0262.mp3|after a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0263.mp3|that poor dear germany really believes that she is right and we are wrong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0265.mp3|when you come to think of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0266.mp3|a man eating tiger feels the same way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0267.mp3|it fights with a high heart and a hot reproach just as we do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0270.mp3|why how funny so are we said our witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0271.mp3|but then how very peculiar that two crusaders should apparently be fighting each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0275.mp3|throughout the ages she has been the rob|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0276.mp3|there was a violent explosion quite close to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0277.mp3|and the cloud reeled and shook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0278.mp3|about a foot of the german end of it broke off and was dissolved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0279.mp3|we're within range of our guns said our witch looking down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0280.mp3|this cloud must be sinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0282.mp3|trying to conceal the nervousness with which she rearranged her rigid looking cloak round her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0283.mp3|she seemed to be sinking herself to a certain extent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0284.mp3|perhaps the warmth of her emotions was melting the cloud beneath her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0285.mp3|certainly she now sat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0287.mp3|her figure submerged in cloud to the waist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0288.mp3|the english witch looked down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0289.mp3|singing a little to keep up her morale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0290.mp3|london looked exactly like the maps you buy for sixpence from sad looking gentlemen in the strand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0291.mp3|only it was sown with a thin crop of lights|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0293.mp3|and the tubes did not show so indecently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0294.mp3|with surprising clearness the rhythmic whispering of the trains and the scanty traffic could be heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0295.mp3|and once even the shrill characteristic voice of an ambulance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0296.mp3|somehow space did not seem disturbed by these sounds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0298.mp3|and there was no real believing in anything but space|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0299.mp3|our witch felt she could have smudged london off the face of space with her finger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0300.mp3|and the thought of seven million lives involved in the fate of that sliding chart carried no conviction to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0302.mp3|and of little lives lived in little rooms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0303.mp3|as one crusader to another she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0304.mp3|do you find it does much good in the war against evil to drop bombs on people in their homes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0306.mp3|every baby is good in bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0309.mp3|trying restlessly to raise herself more to the level of her lighter companion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0310.mp3|who was still perched on the surface of the cloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0312.mp3|it is at home that english women conceive and bear a new generation of enemies of the right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0314.mp3|it is on the home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0315.mp3|the vital place of evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0320.mp3|men come home when they are hurt or hungry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0321.mp3|and women when they are lonely or tired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0323.mp3|you can bring death to a home but never a righteous scourge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0324.mp3|nobody feels scourged or instructed by a bomb in their parlour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0325.mp3|they just feel dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0327.mp3|the cloud was very small now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0328.mp3|the filmy edges of it were faintly rising and falling like the seaweed frill of a rock in the sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0329.mp3|the witch kept her eyes on her opponent's face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0330.mp3|because to look anywhere else gave her a white feeling in her head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0331.mp3|crusades of the high explosive kind she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0333.mp3|indeed even on battle fields|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0334.mp3|ah what are we about what are we about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0335.mp3|we are neither of us killing evil we are killing youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0340.mp3|why don't you go home and ask how it can be a good plan for one crusader against evil to blow up another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0341.mp3|how can two people be righteously scourging each other at the same time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0342.mp3|it is like the old problem of two serpents eating each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0344.mp3|there must be some misunderstanding somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0345.mp3|or else some real evil somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0347.mp3|england is evil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0349.mp3|throughout the ages she has been the robber state crushing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0350.mp3|but she had little luck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0351.mp3|once more she was interrupted by an explosion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0352.mp3|a much louder one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0353.mp3|directly above them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0355.mp3|she seemed suddenly to have found the climax of her life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0356.mp3|and the climax was pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0357.mp3|there was pain and a feeling of terrible change all over her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0358.mp3|smothering her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0359.mp3|and a super pain in her shoulder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0360.mp3|after a second or two as long as death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0362.mp3|like a marionette|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0363.mp3|her hands were up trying to shield her head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0364.mp3|her chin was pressed down to her drawn up knees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0366.mp3|she looked along the cloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0367.mp3|her enemy was not there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0368.mp3|there was a round hole in the cloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0369.mp3|and as she leaned painfully towards it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0370.mp3|she could see a few of the lights of london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0371.mp3|and something falling spasmodically towards them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0372.mp3|the cloud had been shaken to its foundations by the two explosions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0374.mp3|who had been seated perhaps on a seam in the material|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0375.mp3|or at any rate on one of the less stable parts of the fabric|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0376.mp3|had fallen through|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0379.mp3|had been turned inside out above her head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0380.mp3|and rendered useless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0381.mp3|over and about her falling figure her broomstick darted helplessly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0382.mp3|uttering curious sad cries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0384.mp3|even as the english witch watched her enemy's disaster|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0385.mp3|the larger part of the cloud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0386.mp3|weakened by all the shock and movement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0387.mp3|broke away with a hissing sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0388.mp3|the witch's feet hung now over space she dared not move|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0389.mp3|she had difficulty in steadying herself with her unwounded arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0391.mp3|she had no thoughts left but thoughts of danger and of pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0392.mp3|but harold the broomstick came back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0393.mp3|the witch heard a rustling sound close to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0394.mp3|and it startled her more than all the noise of the guns|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0395.mp3|which had come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0396.mp3|as it seemed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0397.mp3|from the forgotten other side of eternity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0398.mp3|the rough head of harold appeared over the cloud's edge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0399.mp3|and insinuated itself pathetically under her arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0400.mp3|very carefully and very painfully the witch reached a kneeling position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0401.mp3|damaging her refuge with every movement in spite of her care|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0402.mp3|she gasped with pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0403.mp3|and harold tried to look very strong and hopeful to comfort her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0404.mp3|he straightened his back and she crawled into the saddle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0406.mp3|which disintegrated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0408.mp3|the tide had come up and submerged it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0409.mp3|harold the broomstick was crippled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0410.mp3|he stumbled as he flew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0413.mp3|he did stunts by mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0414.mp3|they had not strength enough between them to get home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0415.mp3|they made a forced landing in the silver loneliness of kensington gardens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0416.mp3|it was a fortunate place for there is much magic there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0417.mp3|wherever there are children who pretend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0418.mp3|there grows a little magic in the air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0419.mp3|and therefore the wind of kensington gardens thrills with enchantment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0420.mp3|and the round pond|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0423.mp3|is a blessed lake to magic people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0424.mp3|the witch bathed harold her broomstick in the round pond|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0425.mp3|he evidently felt its healing quality at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0426.mp3|for after the first minute of immersion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0427.mp3|he swam about exultantly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0428.mp3|and shook drops full of moonlight out of his mane|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0429.mp3|the bugles sounded all clear in many keys all round the ear's horizon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0430.mp3|their sound matched the waning moonlight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0431.mp3|the witch bathed her shoulder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0432.mp3|and then she found her way to a little quiet place she knew of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0433.mp3|where no park keeper ever looks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0435.mp3|a place where all the mice and birds play unafraid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0436.mp3|because no cat can find the way thither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0437.mp3|you can see the serpentine from that place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0438.mp3|and the bronze shadows under its bridge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0439.mp3|but no houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0440.mp3|and no railways|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0441.mp3|and no signs of london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0442.mp3|here the witch made a little fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0443.mp3|and leaned three sticks together over it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0447.mp3|and spring smelling grasses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0448.mp3|and the roots of unappreciated weeds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0450.mp3|over the mixture she shook out the contents of one of her little paper packets of magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0451.mp3|all this she boiled over her fire for many hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0452.mp3|sitting beside it in the silver darkness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0453.mp3|with her knees drawn up and her hands clasped in front of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0454.mp3|the trees sprang up into the moonlight like dark fountains from the pools of their own shadows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0455.mp3|little shreds of cloud flowed wonderfully across the sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0456.mp3|there was no sound except the sound of the water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0457.mp3|like an uncertain player upon a little instrument|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0458.mp3|the charm was still unfinished when the dawn passed over london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0459.mp3|and the sun came up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0462.mp3|the trees of the gardens remembered their daylight shadows again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0463.mp3|and forgot their mystery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0464.mp3|the water birds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0465.mp3|after examining their shoulder blades with minute care for some moments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0466.mp3|launched themselves upon a lake of diamonds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0467.mp3|there seemed a veil of mist and bird song over the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0469.mp3|after long deafness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0470.mp3|the witch anointed her shoulder with the charm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0471.mp3|after having first made a drop of potion out of the bubbles in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0472.mp3|this potion she drank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0473.mp3|and was healed of her wound and her weariness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0474.mp3|and of all desires except a desire to sleep with her face among the daffodils|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0475.mp3|she was the most beautifully alone person in the world that morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0476.mp3|nobody could have found her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0478.mp3|but the coarse eye of a park keeper could never have seen it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0479.mp3|she had escaped from the net of the cruel hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0480.mp3|for her the stained world was washed clean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0481.mp3|for her all horror held its breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_06_benson_0482.mp3|for her there was absolute spring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0001.mp3|finding herself unfetched by the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0003.mp3|she expected to find the witch at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0008.mp3|are you sure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0012.mp3|with a touching faith in the combined protective powers of twelve inches of mattress and nine inches of dog|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0013.mp3|had been reading a little paper book called love in society by the light of an electric torch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0014.mp3|it's all truly over said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0015.mp3|who had come home through a roar of rumour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0018.mp3|but that hardly sounds likely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0024.mp3|that's all right said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0025.mp3|for now i shall be able to buy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0026.mp3|without pawning anything for the moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0028.mp3|i know she has some|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0029.mp3|the night was by then far from young|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0030.mp3|in fact it was well into its second childhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0031.mp3|but sarah brown and the dog david sought and tried on land outfits for several hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0032.mp3|the shop was divided into three horizontal departments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0034.mp3|biscuit tins buttressed the counter on every side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0035.mp3|regiments of grape nuts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0037.mp3|stood in review order all round the lower shelves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0038.mp3|on the counter little castles of tinned fruit were built|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0041.mp3|and magic stock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0042.mp3|about on a level with one's head the hardware department began|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0044.mp3|dust pans divorced from their brushes were platonically attached to flat irons or pie dishes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0045.mp3|stephen's inks were allied with penny mugs or tins of boot polish in an invasion of the middle shelves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0046.mp3|and a wreath of sponges crowned the champion of a row of kettles in shining armour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0047.mp3|against the ceiling the drapery section was found|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0049.mp3|ready made breeches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0052.mp3|from this department sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0053.mp3|balanced upon three large biscuit tins placed on the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0054.mp3|chose her outfit with vanity and care|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0055.mp3|the general effect was not good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0056.mp3|but she did not know this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0058.mp3|she was filled with a simple pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0059.mp3|for she was always absurdly moved by little excitements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0060.mp3|and by any prospect of a changed to morrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0061.mp3|she was not really used to being alive at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0062.mp3|and that is what made her take to magic so kindly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0063.mp3|in six hours she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0064.mp3|i shall be on my way to something utterly new|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0065.mp3|and in six hours she was on her way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0066.mp3|whistling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0068.mp3|the dog david ran in front of her among the daisies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0069.mp3|the rabbits can never be caught in this land of happy animals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0070.mp3|but they give good sport and always play fair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0071.mp3|david blessing brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0072.mp3|a dog of independent yet loving habit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0073.mp3|had spent about four fifths of his life in the brown family|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0074.mp3|he was three years old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0075.mp3|and though ineligible for military service|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0077.mp3|and in a symmetrical heart shaped spot near his tail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0078.mp3|to sarah brown he was the question and the answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0079.mp3|his presence was a constant playtime for her mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0080.mp3|so well was he loved that he seemed to her to move in a little mist and clamour of love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0081.mp3|with every one else she held but lame intercourse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0082.mp3|but her dog david and she withheld no passing thought from each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0084.mp3|i believe that sarah brown had loved the dog david so much that she had given him a soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0086.mp3|david said that they had found out that his second name was blessing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0087.mp3|and that they laughed at him for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0088.mp3|his face was seamed with the scars of their laughing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0089.mp3|but i know that the enmity had a more fundamental reason than that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0090.mp3|i know that when men speak with the tongues of angels they are shunned and hated by men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0091.mp3|and so i think that when dogs approach humanity too nearly they are banished from the love of their own kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0093.mp3|but she never failed to be surprised by the enchantment of the enchanted forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0094.mp3|the green ride runs straight through it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0095.mp3|so incredibly straight that as you walk along it the end of it is at the end of your sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0096.mp3|and is like a star in a green sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0097.mp3|there is a dream that binds your mind as you cross the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0098.mp3|it is like an imitation of eternity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0100.mp3|as you pass into the forest's shade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0101.mp3|time passes from before you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0103.mp3|as you pass out of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0104.mp3|you seem to have lived a thousand quiet and utterly forgotten lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0105.mp3|clocks and calendars have no meaning in the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0106.mp3|the seasons and the hours haunt it at their will and abide by no law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0108.mp3|so the night in the enchanted forest comes and goes like a ghost upon the sight of lovers of the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0109.mp3|for there you may step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0110.mp3|unastonished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0111.mp3|from the end of a day into its beginning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0112.mp3|there the summer and the winter may dodge each other round one tree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0113.mp3|there you may see at one glance a spring hoar frost and an autumn trembling of airs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0114.mp3|a wild cherry tree blossoming beside a tawny maple|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0115.mp3|the forest is so deep and so thick that it provides its own sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0116.mp3|and can enjoy its own impulses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0117.mp3|and its own quiet anarchy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0118.mp3|there you forget that sky of ours across whose face some tyrant drives our few docile seasons in conventional order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0119.mp3|i think the dog david in his own way shared the dream that leads wayfarers through the enchanted forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0121.mp3|he was all shining and dewy with adventure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0122.mp3|and his tail was upright|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0123.mp3|as though he were pretending that it carried a flag|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0124.mp3|on an abrupt hill in the middle of an enormous green meadow a castle stood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0125.mp3|just as richard had predicted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0126.mp3|it was to let and was not looking its best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0127.mp3|some man of enterprise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0128.mp3|taking advantage of its forlorn condition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0130.mp3|you could almost have measured that advertisement in acres|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0131.mp3|it recommended a face cream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0132.mp3|and represented a lady with a face of horrible size|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0134.mp3|which protruded in rather a distressing way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0135.mp3|oak trees stood round the foot of that pale hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0136.mp3|and the general effect was rather that of parsley round a ham|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0137.mp3|between two oaks sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0138.mp3|following directions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0140.mp3|there were not only daisies all over the path but real violets on either side of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0141.mp3|the daisies looked one in the face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0142.mp3|but the violets did not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0143.mp3|because they had morbidly bad manners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0146.mp3|being an artist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0148.mp3|while the daisy has no temperament whatever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0149.mp3|and no excuse for eccentricity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0150.mp3|grasshoppers tatted industriously and impartially among the daisies and the violets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0151.mp3|here outside the forest there was weather again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0152.mp3|and the weather was more promising than generous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0153.mp3|it continued to promise all day without exactly explaining what its promise was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0154.mp3|and without achieving any special fulfilment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0155.mp3|fine silver lines of sunlight were ruled at a steep angle across a grey slate view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0156.mp3|at the gate of higgins farm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0157.mp3|sarah brown was a little disconcerted to find a small dragon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0158.mp3|it was coiled round a tree beside the clipped box archway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0159.mp3|it was not a very fine specimen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0160.mp3|being of a brownish green colour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0161.mp3|and having lost the tip of one wing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0162.mp3|its spine was serrated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0163.mp3|especially deeply between its shoulder blades|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0164.mp3|where it could raise a sort of crest if angered or excited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0165.mp3|but at present it was asleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0167.mp3|sarah brown was uncertain what to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0168.mp3|but the dog david took the matter into his own paws by mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0169.mp3|he had just met one of the castle dogs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0171.mp3|david retorted to this dog's first facetious onslaught with a kindly quip|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0172.mp3|they trod on each other once or twice with extravagant gestures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0173.mp3|and then parted hysterically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0174.mp3|each supposing himself to be pursued by the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0175.mp3|it was then that david tripped over the dragon's barbed tail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0176.mp3|david squeaked and the dragon awoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0177.mp3|it uncoiled itself suddenly like a broken spring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0178.mp3|gosh it said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0179.mp3|asleep again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0180.mp3|i was waiting for you and the sun on my back always makes me sleepy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0181.mp3|i am the foreman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0182.mp3|higgins telephoned that you were coming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0183.mp3|it preceded her through the little green archway that led to the farm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0184.mp3|the sight reminded sarah brown of watching from golders green tube station the train one has just missed dive into the tunnel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0185.mp3|she followed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0186.mp3|on the other side of the archway the whole view of the plain called higgins farm met the adventurer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0187.mp3|the farm buildings were heaped graciously together on a little wave in the sea of ploughed fields|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0189.mp3|they exactly matched their surroundings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0190.mp3|they were plastered dark red|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0191.mp3|and thatched with very old green and brown thatch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0192.mp3|beyond the buildings was a little wood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0193.mp3|its interior lighted up with bluebells|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0194.mp3|and this wood merged into an orchard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0199.mp3|and each section was dotted with people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0200.mp3|they seemed small people even from a distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0202.mp3|as sarah brown advanced at the tail of the dragon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0203.mp3|she saw that the workers were all indeed under ordinary human size|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0204.mp3|the tallest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0205.mp3|a man guiding a miniature plough behind a tall horse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0206.mp3|might have reached sarah brown's shoulder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0207.mp3|none of them seemed hard at work they stood talking in little groups|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0208.mp3|one group as they passed it was trafficking in cigarette cards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0209.mp3|i want to get my gold scale set of english kings complete a voice was saying tragically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0210.mp3|has nobody got edward the confessor none of them took any notice of the foreman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0211.mp3|i'm afraid i haven't got the gift of discipline sighed the dragon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0212.mp3|and fairies are of course abnormally undisciplined creatures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0214.mp3|we simply can't get any one else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0215.mp3|and higgins will not apply for a few german prisoners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0216.mp3|get on with your work you people do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0219.mp3|gone where the good niggers go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0220.mp3|i find that there are quite a lot of people who cannot say the word gone without adding the clause about the good niggers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0221.mp3|these people have vague minds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0222.mp3|sown like an allotment with phrases in grooves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0223.mp3|directly the dragon said to an extent without qualifying the extent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0224.mp3|one saw why it had no gift of discipline|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0225.mp3|i wouldn't attempt this job it continued|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0226.mp3|winding breathlessly along the rutty road|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0227.mp3|only i am under a great obligation to richard higgins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0230.mp3|he rescued me from a lot of mischievous knights who were persecuting me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0233.mp3|and the rest were trying to stick their nasty spears between my scales|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0234.mp3|really you know it was quite dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0235.mp3|i have known a fellow's eye put out that way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0237.mp3|though i might have tackled one at a time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0238.mp3|richard higgins rode right into the midst of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0239.mp3|knocking them right and left|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0242.mp3|we scrape along somehow but i'm afraid i'm not really suited for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0243.mp3|they reached a part of a field in which broad beans were enjoying an innocent childhood among white butterflies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0244.mp3|if you wouldn't mind said the dragon shyly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0249.mp3|for only your amateur land woman wears breeches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0251.mp3|they were singing curious old round songs like summer dreams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0252.mp3|you could hear strange fragments of phrases passing from voice to voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0253.mp3|they took no notice of sarah brown and she began to work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0254.mp3|oh my one she said to david|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0255.mp3|how happy this is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0256.mp3|no wonder they sing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0257.mp3|any one must sing working like this in great fields|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0258.mp3|why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0259.mp3|i even remember that the shropshire lad whistled once by mistake|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0261.mp3|on his own admission|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0262.mp3|until a fatalistic blackbird recalled him to his usual tragic mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0263.mp3|david sat uncomfortably on a broad bean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0265.mp3|for a moment he had thought that she was seeking for a mouse with some patent mouse finding implement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0266.mp3|he had even tried to help her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0268.mp3|but one sniff had showed him the empty futility of the thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0271.mp3|waiting to be attended to and freed from their embarrassments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0273.mp3|she decided|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0274.mp3|standing up ostensibly to greet an aeroplane|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0275.mp3|she became very glad of the occasional aeroplanes that crossed above her field|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0276.mp3|and gave her an excuse for standing with a straight back to watch them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0277.mp3|aeroplanes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0278.mp3|crossing singly or in wild bird formations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0280.mp3|while turning his own eyes inevitably upwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0281.mp3|secretly thinks his neighbour lamentably rustic and unsophisticated for looking at them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0282.mp3|every aeroplane that crosses faery feels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0284.mp3|the reflected magic from the land below|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0286.mp3|you may see one industriously climbing the clouds over the enchanted forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0287.mp3|evidently trying hard to be intent on its destination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0288.mp3|you may see it falter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0289.mp3|struggling with its sense of duty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0290.mp3|and then break weakly into a mild figure eight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0292.mp3|the spirit of frivolous competition enters into the aeroplane|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0293.mp3|its duty is flung to the winds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0294.mp3|it flaunts itself up and down once or twice as if to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0295.mp3|now look everybody i'm going to be clever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0296.mp3|then it goes mad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0299.mp3|it stands upon its tail and falls upward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0301.mp3|it circles impertinently round your head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0303.mp3|it bounds upon a field of onions and rebounds in the same breath from the topmost cloud of heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0306.mp3|and check itself in the act of some new paroxysm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0307.mp3|it remembers the european war that gave it birth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0308.mp3|it thinks of its mates scanning the sky for its coming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0309.mp3|its frivolity ebbs suddenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0311.mp3|it collects its wits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0312.mp3|emits a few contrite bubbles of smoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0313.mp3|and leaps beyond sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0314.mp3|whenever this happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0317.mp3|encouraging it by brazen gestures to further extravagances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0318.mp3|and striving to reach its hearing with loud shrill cries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0319.mp3|there was very little difference between these fairies and other lady war workers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0320.mp3|in fact they were only distinguishable by their stature and by the empty and innocent expression of their faces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0321.mp3|also perhaps by their tuneful singing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0322.mp3|and by a habit of breaking out suddenly into country dances between the bean rows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0323.mp3|sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0324.mp3|who worked a great deal more industriously than any one else in sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0325.mp3|soon overtook them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0326.mp3|and while conscious of that touch of interested scorn always felt by the one towards the herd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0327.mp3|found relief in watching their vagaries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0328.mp3|and presently in speaking to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0329.mp3|for she needed relief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0330.mp3|poor sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0331.mp3|her disabilities were catching her up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0334.mp3|so to speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0335.mp3|the distant approaching tramp of that pain in her side under whose threat she had lived all her life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0336.mp3|but there were seventy five beans yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0338.mp3|a high note not quite true pitched|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0340.mp3|three blisters and a half were persecuting her hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0344.mp3|she could almost imagine she saw death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0345.mp3|waiting for her tactfully beyond the last bean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0346.mp3|she had no sense of proportion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0348.mp3|even under torture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0349.mp3|to finish every task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0350.mp3|in spite of all hindrance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0351.mp3|was her only ambition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0352.mp3|but it was almost always frustrated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0353.mp3|seventy more beans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0354.mp3|three score and ten thought sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0356.mp3|only a lifetime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0357.mp3|she bent to her work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0359.mp3|and as after a struggle she dragged its protesting roots from the earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0360.mp3|something fell from it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0361.mp3|oh a nest she gasped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0364.mp3|look what she's done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0365.mp3|it's clement's nest poor chap he only married in february|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0367.mp3|cries of consternation were heard from every bean row|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0368.mp3|clement's nest was really almost more than semi detached|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0370.mp3|the two eggs in it were at once unseated and one was broken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0371.mp3|sarah brown was deeply distressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0372.mp3|what a blind fool i am she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0373.mp3|trying helplessly to replace the nest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0376.mp3|she is almost hysterical about the sanctity of the home and all that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0377.mp3|she'll probably get a divorce now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0378.mp3|oh poor clement poor clement said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0379.mp3|will he be terribly cut up there he is replied the fairy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0381.mp3|he's watching you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0382.mp3|that's clement's voice you hear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0383.mp3|clement's voice exclaimed sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0384.mp3|singing like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0385.mp3|why he sounds perfectly happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0386.mp3|perfectly happy mocked the fairy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0387.mp3|his family only sings like that when it's upset|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0388.mp3|perfectly happy indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0389.mp3|can't you understand tragedy when you hear it sarah brown with despairing care tucked the nest up under a bean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0390.mp3|and replaced the unbroken egg|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0392.mp3|then she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0393.mp3|after a busy painful pause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0394.mp3|that shelley probably misunderstood that lark he wrote a poem about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0395.mp3|he called it a blithe spirit you know because it sang|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0396.mp3|do you suppose it wasn't one certainly not said the fairy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0397.mp3|i don't know the actual facts of the case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0398.mp3|but without a doubt your friend shelley was standing on the unfortunate bird's nest all the time he was writing his poem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0399.mp3|sarah brown with a deep sigh began hoeing again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0400.mp3|fifty beans yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0401.mp3|she had altogether ceased to find pleasure in the day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0402.mp3|pain is an extinguisher that can put out the sun|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0403.mp3|she had ceased to find pleasure in the singing of the birds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0404.mp3|the voice of the pigeon sounded to her no more than an unbeautiful falsetto growl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0405.mp3|she was irritated by the fact that the cuckoo had only one song to sing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0406.mp3|she tried not to hoe in time to that song|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0407.mp3|but the monotony of it possessed her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0409.mp3|every time she looked along it the end seemed farther away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0410.mp3|every time she raised her hoe the sword of pain slipped under her guard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0411.mp3|the dog david|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0413.mp3|had forsaken her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0414.mp3|she could trace his course by a moving ripple across the potato patch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0416.mp3|forty beans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0417.mp3|time wears a strangely different guise out of doors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0418.mp3|under the sun time stands almost still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0419.mp3|only when every minute is a physical effort do you discover that there really are sixty minutes in an hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0420.mp3|and that one hour is very little nearer to the evening than another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0421.mp3|people who work indoors under the government of clocks never meet time face to face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0422.mp3|their quick seconds are dismissed by the clicking of typewriters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0426.mp3|our minds may grow old and young again between sunrise and sunset|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0427.mp3|the future may be remade in an hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0429.mp3|we know the length of days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0430.mp3|and after many slow months of stress we come back again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0432.mp3|to our friends in offices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0433.mp3|and find them unchanged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0434.mp3|floating innocently on the surface of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0435.mp3|sarah brown dropped her hoe and fell upon her knees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0436.mp3|i can't hoe any more she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0437.mp3|there are twenty five more beans but i can't hoe them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0438.mp3|why should you asked the nearest fairy indifferently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0440.mp3|we always do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0441.mp3|i said i would hoe this row said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0443.mp3|it is a good thing at least to know one's limitations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0444.mp3|even in affliction she was prosy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0445.mp3|i would advise you to go and have your dinner another fairy said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0446.mp3|only that i ate your sandwiches as i passed just now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0447.mp3|but i left a little lemonade in your bottle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0448.mp3|go under the trees and drink it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0449.mp3|i can't move said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0450.mp3|sit there then said the fairies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0451.mp3|and passed on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0453.mp3|fairies are never ill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0454.mp3|they have immortal bodies but no souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0455.mp3|if they see you in pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0456.mp3|they simply think you are flaunting your superiority and your immortal soul in their faces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0457.mp3|the dragon undulated up the field|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0460.mp3|having your dinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0461.mp3|quite right too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0463.mp3|sarah brown sat on the edge of a shore of green shadow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0464.mp3|and a sea of sun speckled with buttercups was before her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0465.mp3|david blessing came and leaned against her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0466.mp3|his first intentions were good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0467.mp3|he kissed her hurriedly on the chin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0468.mp3|but after that he kissed the sandwich bag|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0469.mp3|sarah brown wondered whether she could cut her throat with a hoe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0470.mp3|suicide while of sound mind she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0471.mp3|the said mind being entirely sick of its unsound body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0472.mp3|if she sat absolutely still and upright the pain was bearable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0473.mp3|but even to think of movement brought tears of pain to her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0474.mp3|she detached her mind from her predicament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0475.mp3|and sank into a warm tropical sea of thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0476.mp3|she was no real thinker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0477.mp3|but she thought much about thinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0478.mp3|and was passionately interested in watching her own mind at work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0479.mp3|thought was like sleep to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0480.mp3|she sank deeply into it without reaching anything profound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0481.mp3|nothing resulted but useless dreams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0482.mp3|and a certain comforting and defiant intimacy with herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0483.mp3|she thought of richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0485.mp3|she noted half consciously and without surprise that the thought of him was beautiful to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0486.mp3|she could not conjure up his face before her mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0487.mp3|because she always forgot realities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0488.mp3|and only remembered dreams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0489.mp3|she could not imagine the sound of his voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0490.mp3|she could not recall anything that he had said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0491.mp3|yet she felt again the magic feeling of meeting him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0492.mp3|and dreamt of all the things that might have happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0493.mp3|and that might yet happen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0494.mp3|yet never would happen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0495.mp3|between him and her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0496.mp3|all the best things that she remembered had only happened in her dreams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0499.mp3|but there was no waking sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0500.mp3|her life was only a sleep walking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0501.mp3|only very rarely did she awake for a moment and feel ashamed to see how alert was the world about her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0502.mp3|so she thought of richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0503.mp3|not of richard's richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0505.mp3|the approach of richard upon a white horse for some time seemed only an extension of her dream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0507.mp3|and partially undoing the work of her hoe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0508.mp3|that she awoke suddenly with a start|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0509.mp3|and caught and tore her breath upon a pin of pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0510.mp3|it seemed that the afternoon had now long possessed the fields|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0511.mp3|it had wakened into a live and electric blue the enchanted forest which she had last noticed shimmering in its noon green|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0512.mp3|all the workers at the approach of richard were working busily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0514.mp3|the dragon was rippling anxiously along at the heels of the white horse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0515.mp3|a helpless hoping for the best expressed itself in every spike along his spine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0516.mp3|i don't really know why she's idling like that sarah brown heard him say in his breathy pathetic voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0517.mp3|i left her hard at work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0518.mp3|they're all the same when my back's turned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0519.mp3|a fellow needs to have eyes at the tip of his tail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0522.mp3|as he approached|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0523.mp3|i think it's just splendid how receptive and progressive working people are in these days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0524.mp3|i was meditating suicide replied sarah brown candidly if faintly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0527.mp3|i have a pocket knife with three blades i could lend you said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0529.mp3|or would you rather try a natty little spell i thought of this morning while i was shaving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0530.mp3|i think any one stricken might find it rather useful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0531.mp3|ah give it to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0532.mp3|give it to me said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0533.mp3|the pain was like a wave breaking upon her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0534.mp3|carrying her away from her safe shore of shadow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0535.mp3|to be lost in seething and suffocating seas without rest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0536.mp3|her eyes felt dried up with fever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0537.mp3|and whenever she shut them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0539.mp3|the smell of beans was terrible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0540.mp3|richard fumbled with something very badly folded up in newspaper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0541.mp3|he also tried ineffectively to light a match by wiping it helplessly against his riding breeches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0543.mp3|he did everything as if he were doing it for the first time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0544.mp3|i had nothing but the morning post to wrap it in he murmured|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0546.mp3|it was the dragon finally who produced the necessary light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0547.mp3|after watching richard with the anxious sympathy of one ineffectual for another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0548.mp3|it said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0549.mp3|let me and kindly breathed out a little flame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0551.mp3|the ashes fluttered down from richard's hand among the beans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0552.mp3|and a thin violet stalk of smoke went up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0553.mp3|sarah brown smelt the unmistakable sour smell of magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0555.mp3|then she found that she had disappeared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0556.mp3|she had never done this before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0557.mp3|she had always been present to disturb and interrupt herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0558.mp3|she had never seen the world before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0561.mp3|through which her everyday self rather wistfully believed that it could see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0564.mp3|she knew what seeing was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0565.mp3|and for the first time she was aware of the real sizes of things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0566.mp3|poor man measures all things by the size of his own foot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0567.mp3|he looks complacently at the print of his boot in the mud|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0568.mp3|and notices that the ant which he crushed was not nearly as big as his foot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0569.mp3|therefore the ant does not matter to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0570.mp3|he also notices that those same feet of his would not be able to walk to the moon within a reasonable time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0571.mp3|therefore the moon does not matter to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0572.mp3|but sarah brown had disappeared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0573.mp3|and therefore could not measure anything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0574.mp3|the spider strode from hill to hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0575.mp3|with the wind rushing through the hair on his back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0577.mp3|clipped on to the earth to shield it from the glare of the gods|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0578.mp3|beyond it was a mere roof of eternity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0579.mp3|pricked with a few billion stars to keep it well ventilated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0580.mp3|sarah brown had for a while all the fun of being a god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0581.mp3|she was nowhere and she was everywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0582.mp3|she could have counted the hairs on david's head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0583.mp3|the world waved like a flower upon a thin purple stalk of smoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0584.mp3|her eyes began to see again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0585.mp3|she was aware of the hollowed tired eyes of richard fixed upon her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0586.mp3|the dragon dawned once more upon her sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0587.mp3|it was inquisitively watching developments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0589.mp3|the horizon was rusty with a rather heavy sunset|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0590.mp3|the fields were full of twilight and empty of fairies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0591.mp3|sarah brown came to herself with a start|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0592.mp3|she was shocked to find that she had opened her mouth to say something absolutely impossible to richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0593.mp3|david's chin was resting on her hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0594.mp3|her side felt frozen and dangerous but not painful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0595.mp3|it didn't altogether answer said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0596.mp3|i'm afraid the wrapping was a mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0597.mp3|a spell of that strength ought to have set you dancing in three minutes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0599.mp3|his name is vivian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0600.mp3|the horse vivian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0601.mp3|who was so white as to be almost phosphorescent in the dusk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0602.mp3|was now further illuminated by a little red light on his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0603.mp3|and a little green light on his tail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0604.mp3|richard was fond of making elaborate and unnecessary arrangements like this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0605.mp3|while neglecting to acquire skill in the more usual handicrafts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0607.mp3|a person of little weight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0608.mp3|was placed astride on the back of the horse vivian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0609.mp3|richard walked beside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0610.mp3|the dragon nodded good bye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0611.mp3|and disappeared into its home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0612.mp3|a low tunnel like barn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0613.mp3|evidently built specially for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0615.mp3|and a conveniently placed chimney which enabled it to breathe enough fire to cook its meals without suffocating itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0616.mp3|sarah brown never saw the dragon again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0618.mp3|a shorn lamb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0619.mp3|so to speak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0621.mp3|now this ride home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0622.mp3|through the enchanted forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0623.mp3|on a tall horse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0624.mp3|with richard walking beside her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0625.mp3|was the most perfect hour of sarah brown's life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0626.mp3|the enchanted forest is only an accumulation of dreams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0627.mp3|and from every traveller through it it exacts toll in the shape of a dream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0628.mp3|by way of receipt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0629.mp3|to every traveller it gives a darling memory that neither death nor hell nor paradise can efface|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0631.mp3|the fact that he was thinking of some one else all the way home was not hidden from her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0632.mp3|but she was a person used to living alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0633.mp3|she could enjoy quite lonely romances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0634.mp3|and never even envy real women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0635.mp3|whose romances were always made for two|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0637.mp3|strange though it may seem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0638.mp3|the kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0641.mp3|she could not bear touch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0642.mp3|she had no pleasure in seeing or feeling the skin and homespun that encloses men and women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0643.mp3|she hated to watch people feeding themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0644.mp3|or to see her own thin body in the mirror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0645.mp3|she ought really to have been born a poplar tree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0646.mp3|a human body was a gift wasted on her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0647.mp3|as they passed along the green ride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0648.mp3|the red light from the horse vivian's neck made a sort of heralding ghost before them on the grass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0651.mp3|the telegraph wires|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0653.mp3|run through the enchanted forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0654.mp3|and the poles in the faint light were like tall crucifixes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0655.mp3|a long way off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0656.mp3|through the opening at the end of the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0657.mp3|were the little lights of mitten island|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0658.mp3|do you know said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0659.mp3|and this is unfortunately the sort of thing that young men do say at silent and enchanted moments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0660.mp3|that if all the magic in this forest were collected together and compressed into a liquid form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0661.mp3|it would be enough to stop the war in one moment my hat said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0662.mp3|in one moment in one moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0663.mp3|my hat said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0664.mp3|the powers of magic haven't been anything like thoroughly estimated even yet said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0665.mp3|i suppose the war was made by black magic suggested sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0666.mp3|trying to talk intelligently and to be faithful to her own thoughts at the same time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0667.mp3|good lord no replied richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0668.mp3|the worst of this war is that it has nothing whatever to do with magic of any sort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0669.mp3|it was made and is supported by men who had forgotten magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0670.mp3|it is the result of the coming to an end of a spell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0671.mp3|haven't you noticed that a spell came to an end at the beginning of the last century|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0674.mp3|oh well said richard i don't know about books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0675.mp3|i can't read you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0676.mp3|but obviously what was wrong with the last century was just that it didn't believe in fairies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0677.mp3|does this century believe in fairies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0678.mp3|if the spell came to an end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0679.mp3|how is it that we are so magic now this century knows that it doesn't know everything said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0680.mp3|and as for spells we have started a new spell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0681.mp3|that's the curious part of this war|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0682.mp3|so gross and so impossible and so unmagic was its cause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0683.mp3|that magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0684.mp3|which had been virtually dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0687.mp3|magic only dies in a tepid world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0688.mp3|i think there is now more magic in the world than ever before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0689.mp3|the soil of france is alive with it and as for belgium|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0692.mp3|except in the dreams of their friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0693.mp3|that sort of austere and secret magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0694.mp3|like a word known by all and spoken by none|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0697.mp3|he was saying things that would have embarrassed him very much had they been said in the piccadilly restaurant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0698.mp3|even after three glasses of champagne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0699.mp3|for this reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0700.mp3|although the borders of the enchanted forest are said to be widening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0702.mp3|what would happen if its trees began to seed themselves in the strand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0703.mp3|imagine the stock exchange under the shadow of an enchanted oak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0704.mp3|and the consequent disastrous wearing thin of the metal casing in which all good business men keep their souls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0707.mp3|a faintly defined fragile ghost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0708.mp3|crouched against the trunk of a tree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0709.mp3|bent awkwardly into an attitude of pain forgotten and ecstatic attention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0710.mp3|it was his dearest moment that they saw a moment without death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0711.mp3|for he was a prisoner in a perfect spell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0713.mp3|the song was like beaten gold wire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0714.mp3|never again in her life did sarah brown profane with her poor voice the words that a perfect singer begot in a marriage with a perfect song|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0715.mp3|but in unhappiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0716.mp3|and in the horrible nights|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0717.mp3|the song came to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0719.mp3|the travellers were approaching the end of the green ride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0720.mp3|but that did not matter to sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0721.mp3|for there had been nothing lacking all the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0723.mp3|began richard in a loud exalted voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0726.mp3|and quenched the magic of the moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0727.mp3|sorry said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0728.mp3|i thought i was talking to my true love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0730.mp3|as they emerged from the forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_07_benson_0731.mp3|i mean i'm sorry it was only me you were talking to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0003.mp3|having slept invisibly among the daffodils for nearly twelve hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0004.mp3|a really very singular thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0007.mp3|he winked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0009.mp3|isn't it said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0010.mp3|winking busily in return|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0013.mp3|pretending not to know indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0014.mp3|i've done what you told me the other day when you came to that committee with your cat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0015.mp3|i thought it over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0019.mp3|to tell you the truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0029.mp3|like you said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0032.mp3|but i see now there was a lot in what you said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0033.mp3|and when i come to think of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0034.mp3|there was no need to make such a terrible lot of extra hay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0036.mp3|when you put it like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0037.mp3|i couldn't say why i was so set on more money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0042.mp3|like you said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0045.mp3|for money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0047.mp3|not money i can use|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0049.mp3|anyway i took it friendly of you to put it so delicate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0050.mp3|so fanciful as you did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0051.mp3|so as them charity ladies didn't smell a rat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0053.mp3|i'm not a proud man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0054.mp3|you're just proud enough said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0056.mp3|if ever i can help you in a business way let me know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0060.mp3|i can give you a tip where to get it wholesale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0067.mp3|but i like it in you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0068.mp3|i'm a man that never takes a joke amiss|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0069.mp3|let's go for a walk together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0070.mp3|no said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0071.mp3|i am so hungry that my ribs are beginning to bend inwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0072.mp3|i must go and have sausages and mash and two apple dumplings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0073.mp3|they found themselves presently seated at the marble topped table of an a b c after an interval that could hardly be accurately described as presently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0074.mp3|sausages and mash dawned on the horizon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0075.mp3|and the witch waved her fork rudely at it as it approached|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0077.mp3|roughing in a ground plan upon her plate with the sure carelessness of the artist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0078.mp3|this is going to be an ivory castle built upon a rock in a glassy sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0079.mp3|the sausage is the dragon guarding it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0081.mp3|a dull but sterling creature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0084.mp3|and i don't want to startle you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0086.mp3|you haven't startled me at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0087.mp3|but the fact is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0088.mp3|i never have been much of a person for getting married|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0089.mp3|thank you very much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0091.mp3|and i do so much enjoy having no money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0094.mp3|he laid a large meat like hand upon hers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0096.mp3|ever since you came into that old committee room i saw there was something particular about you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0100.mp3|i'm not a kissing man but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0102.mp3|it was not his fault if the world failed to grasp exactly what he was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0103.mp3|or rather exactly what he was not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0104.mp3|i have often wondered interrupted the witch talking of kissing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0105.mp3|what would happen if two snipes wanted to kiss each other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0106.mp3|it would have to be at such awfully long range wouldn't it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0109.mp3|don't you think this is becoming rather a tiresome scene said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0111.mp3|i wish those apple dumplings would hurry up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0115.mp3|the witch had a silly vision of two distressed dumplings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0118.mp3|hearing their cue called in a heartless voice from the inexorable sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0119.mp3|desperately applying the last dab of flour to their imperfect complexions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0120.mp3|but the witch found no fault with them when they came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0121.mp3|she gave them her whole attention for some minutes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0122.mp3|well well she said laying down her fork and spoon that's good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0123.mp3|i feel awfully grown up having had a proposal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0124.mp3|when real girls ask me now how many i've had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0125.mp3|i shall be able to say one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0126.mp3|but i met a girl the other day who had had six|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0127.mp3|she had six photographs but she called them scalps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0128.mp3|if you would give me your photograph i could label it a scalp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0129.mp3|and hang it in the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0134.mp3|there of course he was right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0135.mp3|a heart is a sort of degree conferred by providence on those who have passed a certain examination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0136.mp3|magic people are only freshmen in our college|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0137.mp3|and it is useless for us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0138.mp3|secure in the possession of many learned letters after our names|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0139.mp3|to despise them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0140.mp3|they will become sophisticated in due course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0142.mp3|i've still got an awful hunger inside me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0145.mp3|it's wednesday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0146.mp3|let's go and call on miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0147.mp3|she might have grassy sandwiches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0148.mp3|there was a most abrupt and disturbing draught in miss ford's sleek and decorous flat as the witch and the mayor entered it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0149.mp3|the serenity of the night and the morning had been suddenly obliterated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0150.mp3|and kensington suffered a gust or two of gritty wind which blew the babies home from the gardens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0152.mp3|but no rain fell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0153.mp3|rain cannot fall in this book of fine weather|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0154.mp3|the draught that intruded into the flat ruffled the neat hair of five persons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0155.mp3|miss ford herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0156.mp3|lady arabel higgins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0158.mp3|mister bernard tovey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0161.mp3|even in the most comfortable of chairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0162.mp3|her spartan spine never consented graciously to the curves of cushions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0163.mp3|she had smooth padded hair and smooth padded manners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0165.mp3|most people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0166.mp3|especially most women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0167.mp3|were instinctively sorry for her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0168.mp3|because she always looked a little clever and very uncomfortable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0170.mp3|he leaned forward abruptly whenever he spoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0171.mp3|thereby swinging a lock of hair into his right eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0172.mp3|he agreed so heartily with everything that was said that people who addressed him were left with the happy impression that they had said something rather good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0173.mp3|this habit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0174.mp3|combined with the fact that he never launched an independent remark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0175.mp3|had given him the reputation of being one of the best talkers in kensington|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0177.mp3|but he never wondered really|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0178.mp3|he knew almost everything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0179.mp3|and therefore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0180.mp3|while despising the public for knowing so little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0182.mp3|so that he might continue despising and instructing it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0184.mp3|especially on a wednesday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0185.mp3|the utmost social mingling of the classes that those walls had ever seen was the moment when miss ford asked the electric light man what he thought of the war|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0186.mp3|the electric light man's reply had been quoted in the dialect on two or three of the following wednesdays|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0187.mp3|as a proof of miss ford's daring intimacy with men in another station of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0188.mp3|really it would have been simpler|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0189.mp3|though of course not so picturesque|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0190.mp3|to have quoted it direct from its original source|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0191.mp3|john bull|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0193.mp3|the entrance of the witch and the mayor was to a certain extent a crisis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0194.mp3|but miss ford kept her head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0195.mp3|and her three friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0196.mp3|though grasping at once the extraordinary situation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0197.mp3|did not give way to panic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0201.mp3|looking round and breathing very loudly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0203.mp3|he was not at all at his ease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0204.mp3|but being a business man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0206.mp3|he was successfully dissembling his discomfort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0207.mp3|for it had happened that the lift had been one of those lifts that can do no wrong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0208.mp3|the kind that the public is indulgently allowed to work by itself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0209.mp3|and the mayor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0210.mp3|looking upon this fact as specially planned by a propitious god of love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0211.mp3|had tried to kiss the witch as they shot up the darkened shaft|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0212.mp3|if i remind you that the witch was still accompanied by her broomstick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0214.mp3|a creature of unreasoning fidelity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0215.mp3|i need hardly describe the scene further|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0217.mp3|and if he had possessed enough hair on his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0218.mp3|it would have been on end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0219.mp3|as it was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0220.mp3|when the lift stopped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0221.mp3|he retrieved his hat from the floor with a frank oath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0224.mp3|he instinctively followed her across that threshold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0225.mp3|she looked round in the hall and said with a friendly smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0226.mp3|i'm afraid harold gets a bit irritable sometimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0228.mp3|but he forgets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0229.mp3|did he hurt you i am afraid the angry mayor did not give harold credit for much initiative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0230.mp3|kissing is such a funny habit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0231.mp3|isn't it said the witch briskly as she shook miss ford's hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0233.mp3|i wonder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0234.mp3|she interrupted herself as her eyes fell on some green sandwiches which were occupying the third floor of a wicker eiffel tower beside miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0236.mp3|do you know i've only had two meals in the last two days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0238.mp3|so this statement seemed to every one to be a message from another world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0240.mp3|my dear miss watkins said miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0241.mp3|leading the witch towards a chair by the fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0242.mp3|the witch sat down suddenly cross legged on the hearth rug|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0243.mp3|leaving her rather embarrassed hostess in the air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0245.mp3|towering rigidly above her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0247.mp3|experiences said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0248.mp3|after eating one sandwich in silent ecstasy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0249.mp3|i was up in the sky last night talking to a german|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0250.mp3|was that an experience the sky last night was surely no place for a lady said mister frere with rather sour joviality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0252.mp3|i was up in the sky last night too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0253.mp3|great scott exclaimed the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0255.mp3|i lay on the hammock which i have had slung in my cellar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0256.mp3|and shut my eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0257.mp3|and loosed my spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0258.mp3|and it shot upward like a lark released|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0259.mp3|it detached itself from the common trammels of the body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0261.mp3|my spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0262.mp3|in shining armour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0263.mp3|fought with the false|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0264.mp3|cruel spirits of murderers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0265.mp3|i hadn't got any shining armour sighed the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0266.mp3|who had been looking a little puzzled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0269.mp3|and then she quoted the daily mail at me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0272.mp3|but she said to miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0275.mp3|though emitting an applauding murmur|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0276.mp3|leaned back and fixed his face in the ambiguous expression of one who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0277.mp3|while listening with interest to the conversation of liars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0278.mp3|is determined not to appear deceived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0280.mp3|i don't think i can have made myself clear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0281.mp3|excuse me she added to miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0282.mp3|but this room smells awfully clever to any one coming in from outside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0285.mp3|shall i play for you the witch did not answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0287.mp3|and as she rose she threw a little white paper packet into the fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0288.mp3|she danced round the sofa and the chairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0289.mp3|the floor shook a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0290.mp3|and all her watchers twisted their necks gravely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0291.mp3|like lizards watching an active fly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0293.mp3|by appearing in the doorway with an inaudible announcement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0294.mp3|diverted their attention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0295.mp3|though she did not interrupt the witch's exercises|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0298.mp3|who was a student of henry james's works|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0299.mp3|and therefore constantly made elaborate guesses on matters that did not concern him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0300.mp3|and then forgot them because|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0301.mp3|unlike mister james's guesses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0302.mp3|they were always wrong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0304.mp3|or perhaps a south eastern and chatham ticket collector|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0305.mp3|but surely a chapel goer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0306.mp3|at any rate the stranger looked ill at ease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0307.mp3|and especially disconcerted by the sight of the dancing witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0309.mp3|she had lost her hold on the reins of that usually dignified equipage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0311.mp3|she therefore concealed her ignorance of her newest guest's identity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0312.mp3|she stiffened her lips and poured out another cup of tea with a nerveless hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0313.mp3|the stranger took the cup of tea with some relief and said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0315.mp3|the witch stopped dancing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0316.mp3|and stood in front of the newcomer's chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0317.mp3|i think yours must be a discouraging job she said to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0318.mp3|getting people punished for doing things you'd love to do yourself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0319.mp3|oh awfully discouraging|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0320.mp3|and do tell me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0321.mp3|there's a little problem that's been on my mind ever since the war started|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0323.mp3|have you considered what will happen to the traffic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0324.mp3|because you know germans on principle march on the wrong side of the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0325.mp3|indeed everybody in the world does except the conscientious british|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0326.mp3|think of the knotted convulsions of traffic at the bank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0329.mp3|and the dam that would occur in piccadilly circus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0332.mp3|it's a long time since i was on point duty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0334.mp3|i'm afraid i'm intruding on your tea party|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0337.mp3|oh certainly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0338.mp3|certainly said miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0339.mp3|who was staring vaguely into the fireplace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0340.mp3|a rather fascinating thread of lilac smoke was spinning itself out of the ashes of the little white paper packet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0341.mp3|the names of the mayor of the brown borough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0347.mp3|in order to escape arrest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0351.mp3|being in possession of an armed flying machine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0359.mp3|there was a stunned silence in the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0361.mp3|after a moment miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0363.mp3|and lady arabel all began speaking at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0364.mp3|and each stopped with a look of relief on hearing that some one else was ready to take the responsibility of speaking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0366.mp3|but lady arabel interrupted her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0368.mp3|this does not concern you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0372.mp3|but you must specify the occasion more exactly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0373.mp3|our committee sees so many applicants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0379.mp3|at nine forty five p m|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0383.mp3|make and number unknown the threads of curious smoke in the fireplace were increasing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0384.mp3|they shivered as though with laughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0385.mp3|and flowed like crimped hair up the chimney|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0386.mp3|i had a dinner party last night certainly stammered lady arabel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0387.mp3|a trembling seized the sock she was knitting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0388.mp3|she had turned the heel some time ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0389.mp3|but in the present stress had forgotten all about the toe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0390.mp3|the prolonged sock grew every minute more and more like a drain pipe with a bend in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0391.mp3|why yes of course i had a dinner party why shouldn't i|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0393.mp3|a private in the london rifles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0398.mp3|such a good quiet creature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0400.mp3|glancing haughtily at the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0401.mp3|oh nobody nobody|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0402.mp3|the servants all gave notice and left|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0404.mp3|of course there was the orchestra|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0405.mp3|twenty five pieces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0406.mp3|but so dependable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0408.mp3|i can't think how it got into the english language without being right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0416.mp3|ingenious you know in making experiments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0417.mp3|magnetism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0420.mp3|the policeman withered her once more with a glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0423.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0426.mp3|this is not a court of law|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0430.mp3|and turned to miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0432.mp3|no she replied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0433.mp3|couldn't you say whether it seemed like a male or a female in disguise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0436.mp3|i have said the witch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0437.mp3|the policeman bridled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0442.mp3|eighteen years said lady arabel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0443.mp3|the fumes from the fireplace were very strong indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0444.mp3|but nobody called attention to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0445.mp3|i'm sorry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0446.mp3|said miss ford presently very slowly that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0447.mp3|can't help you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0448.mp3|i have|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0449.mp3|been having|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0450.mp3|nerve storms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0456.mp3|i suppose so she replied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0458.mp3|the policeman turned to the mayor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0459.mp3|now sir he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0460.mp3|could you help me at all in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0461.mp3|look here said the witch rising|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0462.mp3|if you would only come along to my house in mitten island i can truly give you all the information you need|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0463.mp3|in fact won't you come to supper with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0464.mp3|if some one will kindly lend me half a crown i will go on ahead and cook something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0468.mp3|and holding harold's collar she stepped out on to the balcony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0470.mp3|and flew away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0471.mp3|she left a room full of noise behind her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0472.mp3|the policeman who was intoxicated with the strange fumes said hell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0474.mp3|hell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0475.mp3|lady arabel called in vain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0478.mp3|now afflicted with a lock of hair in each eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0479.mp3|seized the policeman by the shoulder thinking to prevent him from jumping out of the window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0480.mp3|you fool he shouted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0481.mp3|the mayor slapped his thigh with a loud report|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0483.mp3|she's a sport|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0486.mp3|mister darnby frere said my word rather cautiously several times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0487.mp3|and rubbed the bridge of his nose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0488.mp3|he rather thought everybody was pulling his leg but could not be sure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_08_benson_0489.mp3|only miss ford sat silent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0001.mp3|followed by the dog david|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0002.mp3|reached the mitten island ferry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0003.mp3|after travelling slowly by moonlight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0004.mp3|they were surprised to see a great crowd of people banked up on the island|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0005.mp3|and one man in the uniform of a policeman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0006.mp3|standing alone on the mainland|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0007.mp3|about ten yards from land the ferryman sat in his boat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0008.mp3|rowing gently to keep himself stationary in the current|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0010.mp3|in the tone of one exhausted by long argument|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0012.mp3|he turned to richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0017.mp3|the ferryman said if the king of england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0019.mp3|was waiting to cross now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0020.mp3|i wouldn't come in for them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0022.mp3|the crowd across the river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0023.mp3|divining that a climax of defiance was being reached|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0027.mp3|i am said richard to his companion's surprise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0030.mp3|t b watkins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0032.mp3|possibly a male in female disguise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0034.mp3|and one boarding house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0035.mp3|all in one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0036.mp3|i own it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0037.mp3|i can recite you the prospectus if you like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0038.mp3|i have a superintendent there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0040.mp3|i did not know she was believed to be a male in female disguise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0044.mp3|he succeeded in killing one insect upon the bridge of his nose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0045.mp3|and left it there by mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0046.mp3|a strangely ignoble corpse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0047.mp3|sarah brown suspected richard of some responsibility for this untimely persecution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0048.mp3|that party is charged with an offence against the defence of the realm act said the policeman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0049.mp3|with being|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0050.mp3|although a civilian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0051.mp3|in possession of a flying machine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0057.mp3|do either of you know the present whereabouts of the party persisted the policeman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0058.mp3|attacked on every side by insects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0059.mp3|he was becoming rather pathetic in his discomfort and indignity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0061.mp3|his fat busy hands were not agile enough to defend him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0062.mp3|he felt unsuccessful and foolish and very near the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0063.mp3|he wished quite disproportionately to be at home with his admiring wife in acton|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0064.mp3|sarah brown shook her head in reply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0071.mp3|after a baffled pause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0073.mp3|with genuine shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0075.mp3|i know i've heard it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0076.mp3|i've tried and tried to learn it at my mother's knee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0077.mp3|it begins with an h i think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0078.mp3|that's the worst of not being able to read or write|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0079.mp3|i can describe the place to you exactly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0080.mp3|a house with a lot of windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0081.mp3|that sees a long way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0082.mp3|if you turn your back on the marble arch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0083.mp3|and go on till you get to a big poster saying eat less meat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0084.mp3|and then turn to your right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0085.mp3|pointing to the left|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0086.mp3|or again if you go by air as the crow flies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0090.mp3|almost with a break in his voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0095.mp3|he raised his whistle to his lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0096.mp3|but before he could blow it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0097.mp3|the climax of this the least successful evening of his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0098.mp3|overwhelmed him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0099.mp3|a shadow swept over the party|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0100.mp3|a large flying substance caught him full on the back of the neck and knocked him off the landing stage into the river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0102.mp3|oh look what i've done look what i've done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0103.mp3|she exclaimed in an ecstasy of vexation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0104.mp3|there was no need to tell anybody to look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0105.mp3|five hundred odd people were already doing so with enthusiasm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0106.mp3|oh what a dreadfully bad landing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0110.mp3|richard stretched out his riding crop to the splashing policeman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0111.mp3|murmuring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0113.mp3|don't be frightened said the witch to the policeman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0114.mp3|we'll soon get you out and the water's so shallow you can't sink|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0115.mp3|talking of sinking richard there's a question that puzzles me rather|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0120.mp3|and rats pride themselves so on knowing when to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0121.mp3|sarah brown seized the witch by the shoulder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0124.mp3|i've only just this minute come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0125.mp3|go away go away was all that sarah brown could manage to repeat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0126.mp3|oh very well said the witch in her offended grown up voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0127.mp3|i can take a hint i suppose as well as anybody|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0128.mp3|i'm going|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0130.mp3|and flew away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0131.mp3|the policeman climbed out of the water looking like an enraged seal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0132.mp3|peals of laughter from the other side of the moonlit river robbed him of adequate words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0135.mp3|seeing richard kissing the horse vivian on the nose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0136.mp3|preparatory to riding away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0138.mp3|you don't know how tired i am of loud noises said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0139.mp3|lifting one foot with dignity to the stirrup|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0140.mp3|you don't know how bitterly i long to be still and hear things very far off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0141.mp3|but always there is an angry voice or the angry noise of guns in the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0143.mp3|and pulled himself slowly into the saddle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0144.mp3|the policeman stood mysteriously impotent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0145.mp3|water dripped loudly from his clothes and punctuated richard's quiet speech|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0146.mp3|dear policeman continued richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0147.mp3|i believe you have talked so much to night that you haven't heard what a quiet night it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0149.mp3|and yet you make more noise than all the stars together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0150.mp3|you are not so cold as the moon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0151.mp3|and yet your teeth chatter more loudly than hers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0152.mp3|the heat of your wrath is less than the heat of the sun|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0153.mp3|and yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0154.mp3|while he is silent and departed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0155.mp3|you fill the air with clamour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0156.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0157.mp3|if i may say so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0158.mp3|seem to be outstaying your welcome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0159.mp3|oh dear policeman listen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0161.mp3|if there were no london on this side and no war on that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0162.mp3|the silence would be deep enough to fill all the seas of all the worlds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0163.mp3|he shook the reins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0164.mp3|and the horse vivian moved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0165.mp3|treading quietly on the strip of grass that borders the path to the ferry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0166.mp3|i am going to talk to my true love now said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0167.mp3|his voice fading away as he rode|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0168.mp3|my true love's voice is the only voice that is a little more beautiful to me than silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0169.mp3|for a moment he looked every inch a wizard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0170.mp3|every button on his uniform and every buckle on the horse vivian's harness caught the moonlight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0172.mp3|the policeman seemed quieted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0177.mp3|in a minute in a minute my one she was saying to david|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0178.mp3|we are nearly home now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0179.mp3|we shall soon be quiet now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0180.mp3|there was always something startlingly inoffensive about sarah brown's appearance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0182.mp3|all the same said the policeman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0183.mp3|sarah brown did not hear him but she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0184.mp3|oh i am so very sorry it happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0187.mp3|but it is so terrible to see any one have an accident to his dignity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0188.mp3|you must forget it quickly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0189.mp3|you must run and find someone who knows you at your best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0190.mp3|you must tell her a fine revised version of the incident|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0191.mp3|and then you will feel better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0192.mp3|the ferryman shouted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0193.mp3|i don't mind coming in now to fetch this young woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0194.mp3|you can come too now if you like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0196.mp3|for the party you're looking for is not at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0201.mp3|not by a long chalk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0203.mp3|as sarah brown landed on mitten island she could not distinguish the faces of the waiting crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0204.mp3|but she heard sharp anxious voices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0206.mp3|she never speaks but kindness the dear lamb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0207.mp3|she's more of a saint than any in the calendar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0210.mp3|she's the good fairy of the island|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0215.mp3|the law has driven her away said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0216.mp3|there is no magic now on mitten island|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0217.mp3|she staggered through the open door of the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0218.mp3|this is richard's house she said to herself as she entered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0219.mp3|and felt doubly alone because richard was far away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0220.mp3|riding to his true love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0221.mp3|she struck her last match lit the lantern and looked round|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0222.mp3|there was no sound in the house of living alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0223.mp3|she thought there would never again be any magic sound there to penetrate to her imprisoned hearing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0224.mp3|the aprons hanging from the ceiling near the door flapped in the cold wind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0225.mp3|and she thought they were like grey bats in a cave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0226.mp3|the breeze blew out the open lantern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0227.mp3|ah how desolate how desolate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0229.mp3|there was something very largely and badly written on it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0233.mp3|sarah brown climbed up the short stairway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0234.mp3|painful step by painful step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0237.mp3|and breathing with fearful caution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0238.mp3|she looked at the empty grate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0239.mp3|she put a cigarette in her mouth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0240.mp3|the unconscious and futile answer of the dweller alone to that blind hunger for comfort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0241.mp3|but she had no matches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0242.mp3|and presently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0243.mp3|dimly conscious that her groping for comfort had lacked result|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0244.mp3|she absently put another cigarette into her mouth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0245.mp3|and then felt a fool|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0246.mp3|she stared at the cold window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0247.mp3|the sky seemed to be nailed carelessly to it by means of a crooked star or two|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0249.mp3|when you have fever and sometimes think that your beloved stands in the doorway to bring you comfort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0250.mp3|and sometimes think that you have no beloved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0251.mp3|and that there is no one left in all the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0252.mp3|no word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0253.mp3|no warmth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0254.mp3|nor ever a kindly candle to be lighted in that spotted darkness that walls up your hot sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0255.mp3|again on those nights you dream that you have already done those genial things your body cries for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0256.mp3|or perhaps that other has done them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0258.mp3|a cup of something cool and beautifully sour stands ready to your hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0259.mp3|you can hear the delicious rattle of china on a tray in the passage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0261.mp3|and presently perhaps to eat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0262.mp3|when you feel better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0263.mp3|but again and again your eyes open on the cold dumb darkness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0264.mp3|and there is nothing but the wind and strange sinister emptiness creaking on the stair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0265.mp3|these are the terrible nights of living alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0266.mp3|yet no real lover of that house and of that state would ever exchange one of those haunted and desert nights for a night spent watched|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0267.mp3|in soft warm places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0268.mp3|sarah brown was not long left alone that night to look at the strip of moonlight on the cold ashes of her fireplace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0269.mp3|the shop below shook suddenly with many footfalls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0270.mp3|and the metallic officious barking of the dog david rent the still air of her cell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0271.mp3|a man's voice at the foot of the stairs said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0272.mp3|i can hear a dog barking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0273.mp3|and a woman's voice followed it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0276.mp3|is that you sarah brown was only aware of a vague and irksome disturbance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0277.mp3|she groped to her door opened it and shouted miserably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0278.mp3|go away policeman go away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0279.mp3|she is not here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0280.mp3|lady arabel came up flashing an electric torch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0282.mp3|why look you are trembling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0284.mp3|don't be afraid for angela we are all here to try and help her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0286.mp3|let me help you into bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0287.mp3|and then you shall tell me what you know of her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0289.mp3|i am well said sarah brown ungraciously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0298.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0300.mp3|i think the police ought to have done it before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0303.mp3|but so talkative my dear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0304.mp3|she led the way downstairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0306.mp3|mister frere was listening sardonically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0307.mp3|as sarah brown went past them into the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0310.mp3|showing that her clothes had lately been home cleaned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0311.mp3|in the darkness of the shop she saw miss ford stooping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0312.mp3|trying to shut the big difficult drawer in which the witch kept her magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0313.mp3|it is frightfully explosive said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0314.mp3|miss ford started and straightened her back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0315.mp3|ah miss brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0316.mp3|i was just looking about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0317.mp3|sarah brown sat gasping on the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0318.mp3|and the rest of the party re entered the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0319.mp3|bringing the lantern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0320.mp3|how very absurd all this is said miss ford nervously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0321.mp3|taking such a great deal of trouble about a necessitous case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0322.mp3|america is in my mind said lady arabel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0324.mp3|anybody who has done anything silly goes to america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0327.mp3|america is entirely populated with fugitives from somewhere else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0331.mp3|who was the only person present really conscious of sanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0332.mp3|only a miracle could produce a passport in these days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0333.mp3|especially for a fugitive from justice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0334.mp3|only a miracle or magic said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0335.mp3|miss ford moved instinctively behind the counter towards the open drawer full of ingredients for happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0336.mp3|we must remember added mister frere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0340.mp3|in fact i cannot for the life of me imagine why on earth we are all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0342.mp3|of course we know it is wrong to break the law but in this case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0343.mp3|well i myself should be the last to blame her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0344.mp3|no not the last said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0345.mp3|what do you mean certainly not the last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0346.mp3|probably not even the penultimate one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0347.mp3|you flatter yourself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0348.mp3|why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0349.mp3|surely some of you ladies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0353.mp3|this was a challenge to miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0354.mp3|she ceased to gaze haughtily on sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0355.mp3|men from three departments of the foreign office are fairly regular wednesday friends of mine she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0358.mp3|so trivial a matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0359.mp3|there was silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0360.mp3|while miss ford toyed gingerly with one of the paper packets out of the witch's drawer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0361.mp3|presently she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0362.mp3|what about richard lady arabel showed sudden irritation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0363.mp3|there you go again meta i have spoken to you of it again and again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0366.mp3|you needn't lose your temper arabel said miss ford coldly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0367.mp3|i only meant that richard might be useful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0371.mp3|as if unconsciously she tore off one corner of the packet of magic she held before adding|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0372.mp3|and besides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0373.mp3|as i have often told you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0374.mp3|i believe richard to have real occult power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0375.mp3|which would give him a special interest in this case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0376.mp3|sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0377.mp3|who was burying her face in her hands and missing much of the conversation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0378.mp3|caught the name of richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0379.mp3|and said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0380.mp3|richard has gone to his true love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0381.mp3|a tempest of restrained embarrassment arose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0382.mp3|she's feverish murmured miss ford turning scarlet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0383.mp3|my dear sarah said lady arabel tartly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0384.mp3|you are quite mistaken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0385.mp3|and i must beg of you to be careful how you repeat idle gossip about my son|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0388.mp3|i will ring up his office said miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0389.mp3|deciding to ignore sarah brown both now and in future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0390.mp3|where is the telephone there is none replied sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0391.mp3|this is the house of living alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0392.mp3|miss ford was pouring a grain or two of the magic into her palm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0393.mp3|how very credulous people are she said with a self conscious smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0395.mp3|she stopped for an astonishing sharp smell filled the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0396.mp3|almost immediately a curious wheezy sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0397.mp3|punctuated by taps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0398.mp3|proceeded from the corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0401.mp3|sarah brown felt suddenly well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0402.mp3|she trembled but was well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0403.mp3|she jumped off the counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0406.mp3|and ring up richard from the ferryman's house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0407.mp3|he may have left his true love now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0409.mp3|as she left the smell of magic was getting stronger and stronger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0412.mp3|was approaching the more excitable passages of the song|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0413.mp3|miss ford was saying really bernard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0414.mp3|sarah brown felt a slight misgiving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0415.mp3|a warm and rather dramatic looking light was shining behind the red curtain of the ferryman's lattice window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0416.mp3|as sarah brown crossed the moonlit road|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0418.mp3|after her recent black hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0419.mp3|to think of all those people in the world who were sitting stuffily and pleasantly in little ugly rooms that they loved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0420.mp3|doing quiet careful things that pleased them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0421.mp3|and she told herself that the thought of richard's little office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0422.mp3|alone and alight in the deserted city every night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0423.mp3|would comfort her often in the darkness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0424.mp3|the ferryman opened his door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0425.mp3|and invited her genially to his telephone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0426.mp3|he had been sitting at his table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0428.mp3|on the table was a bowl of milk from which a large bull snake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0432.mp3|and an intelligent looking small dust coloured snake with a broad nose and an active tongue leaned out of the ferryman's breast pocket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0433.mp3|aren't they beautiful he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0434.mp3|with shy and paternal pride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0435.mp3|as sarah brown tried to find a place on which the python would like to be tickled or scratched|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0438.mp3|the ferryman went on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0439.mp3|there is something about the grip and spring in a snake's body that makes me feel giddy with pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0443.mp3|sold by the yard instead of in bottles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0444.mp3|my brain is getting every day colder and quieter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0445.mp3|and all through loving snakes so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0446.mp3|sarah brown rang up richard's office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0448.mp3|mister higgins was not in the office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0451.mp3|gone to his true love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0452.mp3|but any minor business matter connected with magic could be attended to in his absence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0453.mp3|mister higgins spending so much of his time on the battlefield at present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0454.mp3|a good deal of the routine work had to be done in any case by the speaker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0455.mp3|his confidential clerk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0456.mp3|passports to america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0457.mp3|perfectly simple|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0458.mp3|the office had simply to issue blank sheets treated in a certain way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0459.mp3|and every official to whom the sheet should be presented would read upon it what he would want|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0460.mp3|but mister higgins would have to affix his mark and seal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0462.mp3|probably within the hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0463.mp3|how many passports|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0464.mp3|two said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0465.mp3|one for my friend and one for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0466.mp3|a dog doesn't need one does he a british dog|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0467.mp3|i will book the berths to morrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0468.mp3|i can pawn my or rather i can sell my war loan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0469.mp3|as she hung up the receiver the ferryman asked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0470.mp3|are you having a party up at the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0471.mp3|in the superintendent's absence not intentionally replied sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0472.mp3|why well i just wondered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0475.mp3|sarah brown's misgivings returned like a clap of thunder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0476.mp3|she rushed back to the shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0477.mp3|the lantern was standing in the middle of the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0478.mp3|its glass was shattered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0479.mp3|and out of each of its eight panels streamed a great flame six or seven feet high|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0480.mp3|like the petal of an enormous flower|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0482.mp3|hand in hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0483.mp3|each singing a different song very earnestly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0484.mp3|lady arabel had found somewhere a patent fire extinguisher|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0485.mp3|and was putting on her glasses in order to read the directions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0486.mp3|mister frere was hesitating in the background with a leaking biscuit tin full of water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0487.mp3|the mayor was gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0488.mp3|great scott said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0489.mp3|you'll burn the place down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0493.mp3|nothing matters said miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0494.mp3|we are all going to america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0496.mp3|but that's no reason why you should burn the house down said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0497.mp3|that's what i thought agreed mister frere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0498.mp3|but water won't put out that flame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0499.mp3|the singers fell silent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0500.mp3|only the voice of the invisible mayor could be heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0502.mp3|if those lips could only speak in a loud tremulous voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0503.mp3|to the accompaniment of his own unseen stamping feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0504.mp3|you've been putting magic into that flame said sarah brown distractedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0505.mp3|i told you it was dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0506.mp3|nothing will put magic out except more magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0507.mp3|what will the witch say it doesn't matter what anybody says said miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0509.mp3|no place and no person matters when i am not there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0510.mp3|there are no places and no people existing where i am not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0511.mp3|i have suspected it before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0513.mp3|except me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0514.mp3|look how easy it was to dismiss that gross grocer from sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0515.mp3|he was just a bit of background|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0516.mp3|i have painted him out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0517.mp3|the drapery department on the ceiling was ablaze now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0518.mp3|and flakes of ashy petticoat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0519.mp3|and the metal frames of buttons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0520.mp3|showered to the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0521.mp3|i will go and get help said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0522.mp3|and hurried out of doors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0523.mp3|followed feverishly by david|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0524.mp3|who was not a very brave dog in moments of crisis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0525.mp3|and yet liked to appear busy and helpful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0527.mp3|sarah brown knew that the fire was a magic fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0529.mp3|sarah brown rang up richard's office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0531.mp3|who had a heroic and almost cinematic gift for being on hand at the right moments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0532.mp3|answered her himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0533.mp3|come at once said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0534.mp3|the house of living alone is on fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0537.mp3|and this is such a busy night at the office too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0538.mp3|do you think it is really important|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0539.mp3|it is my house you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0542.mp3|in fact i don't see why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0543.mp3|being a magic fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0544.mp3|it should stop at the water's edge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0546.mp3|very well i'll come said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0547.mp3|as she stepped out of the door he arrived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0548.mp3|i came by flash of lightning he explained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0550.mp3|in the manner of one who has moved swiftly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0551.mp3|the lightning service is getting very bad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0552.mp3|i was held up for quite three quarters of a second over whitehall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0553.mp3|there was some wireless war news coming in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0554.mp3|and the lightning had to let it pass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0556.mp3|what's all this fuss about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0558.mp3|while sarah brown and richard were about fifty yards away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0559.mp3|a many forked and enormous white flame suddenly wrapped the house about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0560.mp3|like a hand clutching and crushing it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0561.mp3|the faggots round the stake are lighted said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0562.mp3|but the witch has fled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0563.mp3|it seemed that the stars were devoured by the flame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0564.mp3|so far did it outshine them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0565.mp3|the flame shrank in upon itself and collapsed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0566.mp3|there was no more house of living alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0567.mp3|oh richard said sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0568.mp3|your mother and miss ford and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0569.mp3|was mother in there asked richard placidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0570.mp3|wonders will never cease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0573.mp3|it is fortunate that no magic of any sort could ever touch mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0574.mp3|and indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0575.mp3|as they pushed through the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0576.mp3|they saw all the recent occupants of the shop arguing at the front gate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0578.mp3|i was singing not blowing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0583.mp3|it doesn't matter said miss ford calmly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0584.mp3|we are all going across the sea to morrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0585.mp3|she roused herself a little and said to mister frere with a smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0586.mp3|you know i inherit the sea tradition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0589.mp3|who was still dreamily beating time to imaginary music with one hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0590.mp3|i put it out said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0591.mp3|i wonder whose house it is added mister tovey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0592.mp3|turning vaguely to face richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0593.mp3|it is my house said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0594.mp3|they all discovered his presence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0596.mp3|are you sure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0598.mp3|they haven't now replied richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0599.mp3|but never mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0600.mp3|it has always seemed to me that there were too many houses in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0603.mp3|it always grieves me to see tradesmen pouring sustenance in at the back door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0604.mp3|and no result or justification coming out of the front door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0605.mp3|i often think that only the houses that men's bodies have deserted are really inhabited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0606.mp3|it was i who burnt your house down richard said miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0607.mp3|but it doesn't matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0608.mp3|it wasn't a real house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0609.mp3|you are right said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0611.mp3|it was the house of living alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0612.mp3|and only to people who live alone was it real|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0614.mp3|it is as though it were a tent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0615.mp3|being moved from its position to follow the fortunes of those dwellers alone who wander continually in silence up and down the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0616.mp3|he looked at sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0617.mp3|talking of wandering said miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0618.mp3|we are all going to america richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0619.mp3|can you get us passports certainly agreed richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0621.mp3|a nice little trip for you all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0625.mp3|if it weren't for the americans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0626.mp3|i have quite a circle of friends in new york said miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0627.mp3|who seemed to be recovering from her nerve storm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0628.mp3|beware said richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0631.mp3|i am not going to america said lady arabel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0632.mp3|i am going home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0635.mp3|i never agreed to the plan at all said mister frere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0636.mp3|i shall be truly thankful to get to bed and wake up to morrow sober|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0637.mp3|i will never go out to tea in kensington again if this is the result|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0639.mp3|fixing his innocent eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0640.mp3|obscured by hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0641.mp3|upon miss ford|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0643.mp3|nobody had yet dared to tell him of the misfortune that had overtaken him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0646.mp3|oh by the way that reminds me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0647.mp3|i didn't need reminding interrupted sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0648.mp3|it seems to me that everybody has forgotten why they came here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0652.mp3|several answered richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0653.mp3|who was always as eager as a travelling salesman to recommend his wares|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0654.mp3|there is an awfully ingenious little spell i can show you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0655.mp3|if you happen to have a telephone book and a compass and a toad's heart and a hair from a black goat's beard about you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0657.mp3|if you stand on a sea beach at low tide on christmas night with the moon at your back and a wax candle in your left hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0658.mp3|and write upon the sand the name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0660.mp3|who is it you want to find the witch answered sarah brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0661.mp3|richard's face fell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0662.mp3|oh only the witch he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0663.mp3|i can tell you where she is without any spell at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0664.mp3|she's with my true love at higgins farm helping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0665.mp3|oh by the way mother i forgot to tell you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0666.mp3|you are a grandmother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0668.mp3|she sat down suddenly on the smooth grass slope between the road and the garden hedge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0669.mp3|ah it is too cruel she cried burying her face in her hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0670.mp3|it is too cruel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0671.mp3|is this my son|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0673.mp3|and all my life i did the things that other people did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0674.mp3|the natural things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0675.mp3|except just once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0676.mp3|and for that once i am so cruelly punished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0678.mp3|who says only things i mustn't understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0679.mp3|who does only things i mustn't see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0682.mp3|taking her hands from her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0683.mp3|looked round aghast at richard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0685.mp3|stroking her arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0687.mp3|she added in a terrified whisper and then broke out again crying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0688.mp3|ah it is too cruel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0689.mp3|richard continued to stroke her arm without comprehension|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/6973/livingalone_09_benson_0696.mp3|but lady arabel still sobbed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0001.mp3|in the island of jamaica|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0002.mp3|some time in the present century|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0004.mp3|and a widow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0006.mp3|but i do not mind confessing that the century and myself were both young together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0007.mp3|and that we have grown side by side into age and consequence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0008.mp3|i am a creole and have good scotch blood coursing in my veins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0009.mp3|my father was a soldier of an old scotch family|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0010.mp3|and to him i often trace my affection for a camp life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0011.mp3|and my sympathy with what i have heard my friends call the pomp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0013.mp3|and circumstance of glorious war|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0014.mp3|many people have also traced to my scotch blood that energy and activity which are not always found in the creole race|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0015.mp3|and which have carried me to so many varied scenes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0016.mp3|and perhaps they are right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0018.mp3|but i am sure i do not know what it is to be indolent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0019.mp3|all my life long i have followed the impulse which led me to be up and doing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0020.mp3|and so far from resting idle anywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0021.mp3|i have never wanted inclination to rove|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0022.mp3|nor will powerful enough to find a way to carry out my wishes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0023.mp3|that these qualities have led me into many countries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0024.mp3|and brought me into some strange and amusing adventures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0025.mp3|the reader|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0026.mp3|if he or she has the patience to get through this book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0028.mp3|some people indeed have called me quite a female ulysses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0029.mp3|i believe that they intended it as a compliment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0030.mp3|but from my experience of the greeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0031.mp3|i do not consider it a very flattering one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0032.mp3|it is not my intention to dwell at any length upon the recollections of my childhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0033.mp3|my mother kept a boarding house in kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0035.mp3|like very many of the creole women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0037.mp3|in high repute with the officers of both services|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0038.mp3|and their wives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0039.mp3|who were from time to time stationed at kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0040.mp3|it was very natural that i should inherit her tastes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0041.mp3|and so i had from early youth a yearning for medical knowledge and practice which has never deserted me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0042.mp3|when i was a very young child i was taken by an old lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0043.mp3|who brought me up in her household among her own grandchildren|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0044.mp3|and who could scarcely have shown me more kindness had i been one of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0046.mp3|i was so spoiled by my kind patroness that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0047.mp3|but for being frequently with my mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0048.mp3|i might very likely have grown up idle and useless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0049.mp3|but i saw so much of her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0052.mp3|and i was very young when i began to make use of the little knowledge i had acquired from watching my mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0053.mp3|upon a great sufferer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0055.mp3|i have noticed always what actors children are|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0056.mp3|if you leave one alone in a room how soon it clears a little stage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0057.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0058.mp3|making an audience out of a few chairs and stools|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0059.mp3|proceeds to act its childish griefs and blandishments upon its doll|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0061.mp3|and whatever disease was most prevalent in kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0062.mp3|be sure my poor doll soon contracted it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0063.mp3|i have had many medical triumphs in later days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0064.mp3|and saved some valuable lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0066.mp3|before long it was very natural that i should seek to extend my practice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0067.mp3|and so i found other patients in the dogs and cats around me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0068.mp3|many luckless brutes were made to simulate diseases which were raging among their owners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0069.mp3|and had forced down their reluctant throats the remedies which i deemed most likely to suit their supposed complaints|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0070.mp3|and after a time i rose still higher in my ambition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0071.mp3|and despairing of finding another human patient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0072.mp3|i proceeded to try my simples and essences upon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0074.mp3|when i was about twelve years old i was more frequently at my mother's house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0075.mp3|and used to assist her in her duties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0076.mp3|very often sharing with her the task of attending upon invalid officers or their wives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0078.mp3|or the military station at newcastle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0079.mp3|as i grew into womanhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0080.mp3|i began to indulge that longing to travel which will never leave me while i have health and vigour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0081.mp3|i was never weary of tracing upon an old map the route to england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0082.mp3|and never followed with my gaze the stately ships homeward bound without longing to be in them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0083.mp3|and see the blue hills of jamaica fade into the distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0084.mp3|at that time it seemed most improbable that these girlish wishes should be gratified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0085.mp3|but circumstances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0086.mp3|which i need not explain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0087.mp3|enabled me to accompany some relatives to england while i was yet a very young woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0088.mp3|i shall never forget my first impressions of london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0089.mp3|of course i am not going to bore the reader with them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0090.mp3|but they are as vivid now as though the year eighteen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0091.mp3|i had very nearly let my age slip then had not been long ago numbered with the past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0092.mp3|strangely enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0093.mp3|some of the most vivid of my recollections are the efforts of the london street boys to poke fun at my and my companion's complexion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0094.mp3|i am only a little brown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0096.mp3|but my companion was very dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0098.mp3|she was hot tempered poor thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0101.mp3|i remained in england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0102.mp3|upon the occasion of my first visit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0103.mp3|about a year|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0104.mp3|and then returned to kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0105.mp3|before long i again started for london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0106.mp3|bringing with me this time a large stock of west indian preserves and pickles for sale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0107.mp3|after remaining two years here i again started home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0108.mp3|and on the way my life and adventures were very nearly brought to a premature conclusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0110.mp3|i dare say it would have resisted all the crew's efforts to put it out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0111.mp3|had not another ship appeared in sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0112.mp3|upon which the fire quietly allowed itself to be extinguished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0114.mp3|but during the time when the contest between fire and water was doubtful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0115.mp3|i entered into an amicable arrangement with the ship's cook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0117.mp3|in consideration of two pounds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0118.mp3|which i was not however to pay until the crisis arrived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0120.mp3|before i had been long in jamaica i started upon other trips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0121.mp3|many of them undertaken with a view to gain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0122.mp3|thus i spent some time in new providence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0123.mp3|bringing home with me a large collection of handsome shells and rare shell work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0124.mp3|which created quite a sensation in kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0127.mp3|but i hasten onward in my narrative|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0128.mp3|returned to kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0129.mp3|i nursed my old indulgent patroness in her last long illness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0131.mp3|in my arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0132.mp3|i went to my mother's house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0133.mp3|where i stayed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0134.mp3|making myself useful in a variety of ways|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0135.mp3|and learning a great deal of creole medicinal art|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0137.mp3|but married him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0138.mp3|and took him down to black river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0139.mp3|where we established a store|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0140.mp3|poor man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0141.mp3|he was very delicate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0142.mp3|and before i undertook the charge of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0144.mp3|i kept him alive by kind nursing and attention as long as i could|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0145.mp3|but at last he grew so ill that we left black river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0146.mp3|and returned to my mother's house at kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0147.mp3|within a month of our arrival there he died|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0148.mp3|this was my first great trouble and i felt it bitterly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0149.mp3|for days i never stirred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0150.mp3|lost to all that passed around me in a dull stupor of despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0151.mp3|if you had told me that the time would soon come when i should remember this sorrow calmly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0152.mp3|i should not have believed it possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0153.mp3|and yet it was so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0154.mp3|i do not think that we hot blooded creoles sorrow less for showing it so impetuously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_01_seacole_0155.mp3|but i do think that the sharp edge of our grief wears down sooner than theirs who preserve an outward demeanour of calmness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0001.mp3|the loss of my mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0002.mp3|and then i was left alone to battle with the world as best i might|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0004.mp3|nor have they ended yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0005.mp3|but i have always turned a bold front to fortune|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0006.mp3|and taken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0007.mp3|and shall continue to take|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0008.mp3|as my brave friends in the army and navy have shown me how|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0009.mp3|my hurts before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0010.mp3|although it was no easy thing for a widow to make ends meet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0011.mp3|i never allowed myself to know what repining or depression was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0012.mp3|and so succeeded in gaining not only my daily bread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0013.mp3|but many comforts besides from the beginning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0014.mp3|indeed my experience of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0015.mp3|it is not finished yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0016.mp3|but i do not think it will give me reason to change my opinion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0017.mp3|leads me to the conclusion that it is by no means the hard bad world which some selfish people would have us believe it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0018.mp3|it may be as my editor says|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0019.mp3|that gently comes the world to those that are cast in gentle mould hinting at the same time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0021.mp3|that the rule may apply to me personally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0022.mp3|and perhaps he is right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0024.mp3|strong woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0025.mp3|plain spoken people might say stout|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0026.mp3|i think my heart is soft enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0027.mp3|how slowly and gradually i succeeded in life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0028.mp3|need not be told at length|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0029.mp3|my fortunes underwent the variations which befall all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0030.mp3|sometimes i was rich one day and poor the next|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0031.mp3|i never thought too exclusively of money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0032.mp3|believing rather that we were born to be happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0034.mp3|had i done so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0035.mp3|i should have mourned over many a promising speculation proving a failure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0036.mp3|over many a pan of preserves or guava jelly burnt in the making|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0037.mp3|and perhaps lost my mind when the great fire of eighteen forty three|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0038.mp3|which devastated kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0039.mp3|burnt down my poor home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0041.mp3|i very nearly lost my life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0042.mp3|for i would not leave my house until every chance of saving it had gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0043.mp3|and it was wrapped in flames|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0046.mp3|i set to work again in a humbler way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0047.mp3|and rebuilt my house by degrees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0048.mp3|and restocked it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0049.mp3|succeeding better than before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0050.mp3|for i had gained a reputation as a skilful nurse and doctress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0053.mp3|sometimes i had a naval or military surgeon under my roof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0054.mp3|from whom i never failed to glean instruction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0056.mp3|when they learned my love for their profession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0057.mp3|with a readiness and kindness i am never likely to forget|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0058.mp3|many of these kind friends are alive now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0061.mp3|which helped me to be useful to my kind in many lands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0063.mp3|and not at all from necessity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0064.mp3|that i remained an unprotected female|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0065.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0066.mp3|i do not mind confessing to my reader|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0067.mp3|in a friendly confidential way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0069.mp3|officers of high rank sometimes took up their abode in my house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0070.mp3|others of inferior rank were familiar with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0071.mp3|long before their bravery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0074.mp3|too often death in the crimea made them world famous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0076.mp3|before she joined them in front of sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0078.mp3|whose death shocked me so terribly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0079.mp3|and with whose useful heroic life the english public have become so familiar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0080.mp3|i can hear the ring of his boyish laughter even now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0081.mp3|in the year eighteen fifty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0082.mp3|the cholera swept over the island of jamaica with terrible force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0084.mp3|perhaps an unfounded one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0087.mp3|anyhow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0088.mp3|they sent some clothes on shore to be washed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0089.mp3|and poor dolly johnson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0090.mp3|the washerwoman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0092.mp3|sickened and died of the terrible disease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0094.mp3|i had but too many opportunities of watching its nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0095.mp3|and from a doctor b|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0096.mp3|who was then lodging in my house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0097.mp3|received many hints as to its treatment which i afterwards found invaluable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0098.mp3|early in the same year my brother had left kingston for the isthmus of panama|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0099.mp3|then the great high road to and from golden california|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0100.mp3|where he had established a considerable store and hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0101.mp3|ever since he had done so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0103.mp3|and at last persuading myself that i might be of use to him he was far from strong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0104.mp3|i resigned my house into the hands of a cousin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0106.mp3|having come to this conclusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0107.mp3|i allowed no grass to grow beneath my feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0108.mp3|but set to work busily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0109.mp3|for i was not going to him empty handed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0110.mp3|my house was full for weeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0111.mp3|of tailors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0112.mp3|making up rough coats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0116.mp3|in addition to these|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0117.mp3|my kitchen was filled with busy people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0118.mp3|manufacturing preserves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0121.mp3|while a considerable sum was invested in the purchase of preserved meats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0126.mp3|if i explain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0128.mp3|the then condition of the isthmus of panama|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0129.mp3|all my readers must know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0130.mp3|a glance at the map will show it to those who do not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0131.mp3|that between north america and the envied shores of california stretches a little neck of land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0132.mp3|insignificant looking enough on the map|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0133.mp3|dividing the atlantic from the pacific|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0134.mp3|by crossing this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0135.mp3|the travellers from america avoided a long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0138.mp3|or an almost impossible journey by land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0139.mp3|but that journey across the isthmus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0141.mp3|was by no means an easy one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0142.mp3|it seemed as if nature had determined to throw every conceivable obstacle in the way of those who should seek to join the two great oceans of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0143.mp3|i have read and heard many accounts of old endeavours to effect this important and gigantic work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0144.mp3|and how miserably they failed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0145.mp3|it was reserved for the men of our age to accomplish what so many had died in attempting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0146.mp3|and iron and steam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0147.mp3|twin giants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0148.mp3|subdued to man's will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0149.mp3|have put a girdle over rocks and rivers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0150.mp3|so that travellers can glide as smoothly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0151.mp3|if not as inexpensively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0153.mp3|as they can from london to brighton|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0154.mp3|not yet however does civilization rule at panama|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0156.mp3|despised by lawless men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0157.mp3|and respected by none|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0159.mp3|whenever they feel inclined now they overpower the law easily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0160.mp3|but seven years ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0161.mp3|when i visited the isthmus of panama|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0162.mp3|things were much worse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0163.mp3|and a licence existed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0164.mp3|compared to which the present lawless state of affairs is enviable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0165.mp3|when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0168.mp3|tumble down town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0169.mp3|for about seven miles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0170.mp3|the steamer reached navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0172.mp3|dreary spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0173.mp3|three sides of the place were a mere swamp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0174.mp3|and the town itself stood upon a sand reef|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0175.mp3|the houses being built upon piles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0176.mp3|which some one told me rotted regularly every three years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0178.mp3|which now connects the bay with panama|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0179.mp3|was then building|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0181.mp3|as far as we could see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0185.mp3|and those on board the steamer who knew it confirmed my opinion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0187.mp3|the white men who met us on the wharf appeared ghostly and wraith like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0188.mp3|and the very negroes seemed pale and wan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0189.mp3|the news which met us did not tempt me to lose any time in getting up the country to my brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0190.mp3|according to all accounts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0192.mp3|with some minor diseases|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0193.mp3|especially dropsy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0194.mp3|were having it all their own way at navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0197.mp3|my medicine chest was called into requisition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0198.mp3|but the sufferers wanted remedies which i could not give them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0199.mp3|warmth nourishment and fresh air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0200.mp3|beneath leaky tents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0201.mp3|damp huts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0202.mp3|and even under broken railway waggons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0203.mp3|i saw men dying from sheer exhaustion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0205.mp3|i was very glad when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0206.mp3|with the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0207.mp3|the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0208.mp3|as the yankees called the bands of pilgrims to and from california|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0209.mp3|made ready to ascend to panama|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0211.mp3|about twelve miles distant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0212.mp3|for the greater portion of that distance the lines ran on piles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0213.mp3|over as unhealthy and wretched a country as the eye could well grow weary of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0216.mp3|the country improved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0217.mp3|and you caught glimpses of distant hills and english like scenery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0218.mp3|every mile of that fatal railway cost the world thousands of lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0221.mp3|and their places had to be supplied by fresh victims from america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0222.mp3|tempted by unheard of rates of wages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0223.mp3|it is a gigantic undertaking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0224.mp3|and shows what the energy and enterprise of man can accomplish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0225.mp3|everything requisite for its construction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0226.mp3|even the timber|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0233.mp3|where my brother was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0234.mp3|the cars landed us at the bottom of a somewhat steep cutting through a reddish clay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0235.mp3|and deposited me and my suite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0236.mp3|consisting of a black servant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0237.mp3|named mac and a little girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0238.mp3|in safety in the midst of my many packages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0239.mp3|not altogether satisfied with my prospects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0240.mp3|for the rain was falling heavily and steadily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0242.mp3|there are two species of individuals whom i have found alike wherever my travels have carried me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0243.mp3|the reader can guess their professions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0244.mp3|porters and lawyers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0245.mp3|it was as much as i could do to gather my packages together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0246.mp3|sit in the midst with a determined look to awe the hungry crowd around me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0248.mp3|after a little while he returned to say that the river side was not far off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0249.mp3|where boats could be hired for the upward journey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0250.mp3|the word given the porters threw themselves upon my packages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0251.mp3|a pitched battle ensued|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0252.mp3|out of which issued the strongest spanish indians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0253.mp3|with their hardly earned prizes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0257.mp3|they had become worse than useless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0258.mp3|so i floundered about terribly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0259.mp3|more than once losing my footing altogether|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0260.mp3|and as with that due regard to personal appearance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0261.mp3|which i have always deemed a duty as well as a pleasure to study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0263.mp3|before leaving navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0264.mp3|attired myself in a delicate light blue dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0265.mp3|a white bonnet prettily trimmed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0268.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0269.mp3|i gained the summit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0270.mp3|and after an arduous descent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0271.mp3|of a few minutes duration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0272.mp3|reached the river side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0275.mp3|for my pretty dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0277.mp3|looked as red as if|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0278.mp3|in the pursuit of science|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0279.mp3|i had passed it through a strong solution of muriatic acid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0282.mp3|upon collecting my luggage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0283.mp3|i found|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0284.mp3|as i had expected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0285.mp3|that the porters had not neglected the glorious opportunity of robbing a woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0286.mp3|and that several articles were missing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0289.mp3|would not avail me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0290.mp3|and stronger measures seemed hazardous and barely advisable in a lawless out of the way spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0291.mp3|where the simple plan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0292.mp3|that they should take who have the power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0293.mp3|and they should keep who can seemed universally practised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0294.mp3|and would very likely have been defended by its practitioners upon principle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0295.mp3|it was not so easy to hire a boat as i had been led to expect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0296.mp3|the large crowd had made the boatmen somewhat exorbitant in their demands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0297.mp3|and there were several reasons why i should engage one for my own exclusive use|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0298.mp3|instead of sharing one with some of my travelling companions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0299.mp3|in the first place my luggage was somewhat bulky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0303.mp3|and very often show this feeling in stronger ways than by sour looks and rude words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0304.mp3|i think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0305.mp3|if i have a little prejudice against our cousins across the atlantic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0306.mp3|and i do confess to a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0307.mp3|it is not unreasonable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0308.mp3|i have a few shades of deeper brown upon my skin which shows me related|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0309.mp3|and i am proud of the relationship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0310.mp3|to those poor mortals whom you once held enslaved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0311.mp3|and whose bodies america still owns|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0312.mp3|and having this bond and knowing what slavery is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0314.mp3|let others affect to doubt them if they will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0315.mp3|is it surprising that i should be somewhat impatient of the airs of superiority which many americans have endeavoured to assume over me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0316.mp3|mind i am not speaking of all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0317.mp3|i have met with some delightful exceptions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0318.mp3|at length i succeeded in hiring a boat for the modest consideration of ten pounds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0320.mp3|my boat was far from uncomfortable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0321.mp3|large and flat bottomed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0322.mp3|with an awning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0323.mp3|dirty it must be confessed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0324.mp3|beneath which swung a hammock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0325.mp3|of which i took immediate possession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0326.mp3|by the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0327.mp3|the central americans should adopt the hammock as their national badge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0328.mp3|but for sheer necessity they would never leave it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0329.mp3|the master of the boat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0332.mp3|his crew were four common enough specimens of humanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0333.mp3|with a marked disregard of the prejudices of society with respect to clothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0334.mp3|a dirty handkerchief rolled over the head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0335.mp3|and a wisp of something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0336.mp3|which might have been linen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0337.mp3|bound round the loins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0338.mp3|formed their attire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0339.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0341.mp3|the thick coating of dirt which covered them kept them warmer than more civilized clothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0342.mp3|besides being indisputably more economical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0343.mp3|the boat was generally propelled by paddles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0344.mp3|but when the river was shallow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0346.mp3|as on english rivers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0348.mp3|whose superior position was indicated by the use of decent clothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0349.mp3|standing at the helm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0350.mp3|gesticulating wildly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0352.mp3|very much shocked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0353.mp3|of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0354.mp3|but finding it perfectly useless to remonstrate with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0355.mp3|i swung myself in my hammock and leisurely watched the river scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0357.mp3|now between low marshy shores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0359.mp3|between steep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0360.mp3|thickly wooded banks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0361.mp3|it was liable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0362.mp3|as are all rivers in hilly districts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0367.mp3|i had not been long afloat before i saw that he would forfeit his worthless pledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0368.mp3|for the wind rose to a gale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0369.mp3|ruffling the river here and there into a little sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0370.mp3|the rain came down in torrents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0371.mp3|while the river rose rapidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0372.mp3|bearing down on its swollen stream trunks of trees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0374.mp3|which it tossed about like a giant in sport|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0375.mp3|threatening to snag us with its playthings every moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0376.mp3|and when we came to a sheltered reach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0377.mp3|and found that the little fleet of boats which had preceded us had laid to there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0378.mp3|i came to the conclusion that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0382.mp3|i should have to pass a night upon the river chagres|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0383.mp3|all i could get to eat was some guavas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0384.mp3|which grew wild upon the banks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0386.mp3|and listened to the crew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0387.mp3|who had rolled together at the bottom of the boat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0389.mp3|in the purest of calico night gear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0391.mp3|until somehow i fell into a troubled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0393.mp3|at daybreak we were enabled to pursue our journey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0394.mp3|and in a short time reached gorgona|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0395.mp3|i was glad enough to go on shore as you may imagine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0396.mp3|gorgona was a mere temporary town of bamboo and wood houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0397.mp3|hastily erected to serve as a station for the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0398.mp3|in the present rainy season|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0400.mp3|the chief part of the population migrated thither|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0401.mp3|so that gorgona was almost deserted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0402.mp3|and looked indescribably damp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0405.mp3|with some difficulty i found a bakery and a butcher's shop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0406.mp3|the meat was not very tempting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0407.mp3|for the gorgona butchers did not trouble themselves about joints|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0408.mp3|but cut the flesh into strips about three inches wide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0409.mp3|and of various lengths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0410.mp3|these were hung upon rails|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0411.mp3|so that you bought your meat by the yard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0413.mp3|i cannot say that i was favourably impressed with this novel and simple way of avoiding trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0414.mp3|but i was far too hungry to be particular|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0415.mp3|and buying a strip for a quarter of a real|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0416.mp3|carried it off to mac to cook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0417.mp3|late that afternoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_02_seacole_0421.mp3|and out of temper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0002.mp3|who very likely has been laughing heartily at my late troubles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0004.mp3|after the long night spent on board the wretched boat in my stiff|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0006.mp3|and the hours of fasting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0007.mp3|the warmth and good cheer of the independent hotel could not fail to be acceptable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0008.mp3|my brother met me on the rickety wharf with the kindest welcome in his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0009.mp3|although he did not attempt to conceal a smile at my forlorn appearance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0010.mp3|and giving the necessary instructions about my luggage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0011.mp3|led the way at once to his house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0012.mp3|which was situated at the upper end of the street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0014.mp3|which agreeable variety occurred twice or thrice a year unexpectedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0016.mp3|he rather damped my hopes by expressing his fears that he should be unable to provide his sister with the accommodation he could wish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0018.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0019.mp3|the crowd from panama has just come in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0020.mp3|meeting your crowd from navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0021.mp3|and i shouldn't be at all surprised if very many of them have no better bed than the store floors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0023.mp3|despite this warning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0024.mp3|i was miserably unprepared for the reception that awaited me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0027.mp3|in its dampness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0029.mp3|and confusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0030.mp3|as it well could be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0031.mp3|but the crowd from the gold fields of california had just arrived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0033.mp3|and the street was filled with motley groups in picturesque variety of attire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0034.mp3|the hotels were also full of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0040.mp3|serviceable boots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0041.mp3|elbowed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0042.mp3|in perfect equality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0043.mp3|keen yankee speculators|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0046.mp3|and clean on the isthmus of panama as in the streets of new york or new orleans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0047.mp3|the women alone kept aloof from each other and well they might|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0050.mp3|it was somewhat difficult to distinguish the majority from their male companions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0051.mp3|save by their bolder and more reckless voice and manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0054.mp3|that many of them adopted male attire for the journey across the isthmus only|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0055.mp3|as it spared them many compliments which their husbands were often disposed to resent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0056.mp3|however flattering they might be to their choice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0057.mp3|through all these i pressed on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0061.mp3|to the independent hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0062.mp3|eagerly anticipating the comforts which awaited me there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0063.mp3|at length we reached it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0064.mp3|but rest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0067.mp3|miserable delusions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0071.mp3|low hut|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0072.mp3|built of rough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0074.mp3|unplaned logs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0075.mp3|filled up with mud and split bamboo|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0076.mp3|a long sloping roof and a large verandah already full of visitors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0077.mp3|and the interior|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0078.mp3|a long room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0079.mp3|gaily hung with dirty calico|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0080.mp3|in stripes of red and white|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0081.mp3|above it another room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0082.mp3|in which the guests slept|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0086.mp3|at the further end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0087.mp3|a small corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0088.mp3|partitioned roughly off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0089.mp3|formed a bar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0090.mp3|and around it were shelves laden with stores for the travellers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0091.mp3|while behind it was a little room used by my brother as his private apartment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0092.mp3|but three female travellers had hired it for their own especial use for the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0093.mp3|paying the enormous sum of ten pounds for so exclusive a luxury|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0094.mp3|at the entrance sat a black man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0096.mp3|giving them in exchange for coin or gold dust he had a rusty pair of scales to weigh the latter a dirty ticket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0097.mp3|which guaranteed them supper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0098.mp3|a night's lodging|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0099.mp3|and breakfast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0100.mp3|i saw all this very quickly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0101.mp3|and turned round upon my brother in angry despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0102.mp3|what am i to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0103.mp3|why did you ever bring me to this place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0104.mp3|see what a state i am in cold hungry and wretched|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0105.mp3|i want to wash to change my clothes to eat to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0106.mp3|but poor edward could only shrug his shoulders and shake his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0107.mp3|in answer to my indignant remonstrances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0108.mp3|at last he made room for me in a corner of the crowded bar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0109.mp3|set before me some food|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0110.mp3|and left me to watch the strange life i had come to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0111.mp3|and before long i soon forgot my troubles in the novelty of my position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0112.mp3|the difference between the passengers to and from california was very distinguishable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0113.mp3|those bound for the gold country were to a certain extent fresh from civilization|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0114.mp3|and had scarcely thrown off its control|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0115.mp3|whereas the homeward bound revelled in disgusting excess of licence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0116.mp3|although many of the women on their way to california showed clearly enough that the life of licence they sought would not be altogether unfamiliar to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0117.mp3|they still retained some appearance of decency in their attire and manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0118.mp3|but in many cases as i have before said the female companions of the successful gold diggers appeared in no hurry to resume the dress or obligations of their sex|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0119.mp3|many were clothed as the men were in flannel shirt and boots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0121.mp3|but with much ease and courage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0122.mp3|and in their conversation successfully rivalled the coarseness of their lords|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0124.mp3|on the whole|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0125.mp3|that those french lady writers who desire to enjoy the privileges of man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0126.mp3|with the irresponsibility of the other sex|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0128.mp3|the chief object of all the travellers seemed to be dinner or supper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0129.mp3|i do not know what term they gave it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0130.mp3|down the entire length of the independent hotel ran a table covered with a green oilskin cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0131.mp3|and at proper intervals were placed knives and forks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0133.mp3|and cups and saucers turned down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0135.mp3|and wished to secure his place for the coming repast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0136.mp3|he would turn his plate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0139.mp3|which mode of reserving seats seemed respected by the rest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0140.mp3|and as the evening wore on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0141.mp3|the shouting and quarrelling at the doorway in yankee twang increased momentarily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0142.mp3|while some seated themselves at the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0145.mp3|amidst all this confusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0146.mp3|my brother was quietly selling shirts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0150.mp3|to the travellers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0152.mp3|drawing attention to the good cheer of the independent hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0153.mp3|over and over again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0154.mp3|while i cowered in my snug corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0155.mp3|wishing to avoid the notice of all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0156.mp3|did i wish myself safe back in my pleasant home in kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0157.mp3|but it was too late to find out my mistake now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0158.mp3|at last the table was nearly filled with a motley assemblage of men and women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0159.mp3|and the slapjack|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0160.mp3|hot and steaming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0161.mp3|was carried in by the black cooks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0162.mp3|the hungry diners welcomed its advent with a shout of delight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0163.mp3|and yet it did not seem particularly tempting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0165.mp3|and before the dinner was over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0166.mp3|i saw ample reasons to induce any hotel keeper to give it his patronage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0167.mp3|in truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0168.mp3|it was a thick substantial pancake of flour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0171.mp3|eggs were far too expensive to be used in its composition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0172.mp3|and by the time the supply had disappeared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0173.mp3|i thought the largest appetites must have been stayed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0174.mp3|but it was followed by pork|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0175.mp3|strips of beef stewed with hard dumplings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0177.mp3|great dishes of rice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0179.mp3|the whole being washed down with an abundance of tea and coffee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0180.mp3|chickens and eggs were provided for those who were prepared to pay for these luxuries of panama life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0181.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0182.mp3|so scarce and expensive were they|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0184.mp3|as i afterwards discovered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_03_seacole_0186.mp3|as a sure attraction for the richer and more reckless diggers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0002.mp3|or even to despond if such were my inclination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0003.mp3|i have had some opportunities recently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0005.mp3|and enter into schemes for staying there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0007.mp3|and in the meanwhile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0008.mp3|and until i could find a convenient hut for my intended hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0009.mp3|i remained my brother's guest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0011.mp3|before the passengers for panama had been many days gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0012.mp3|it was found that they had left one of their number behind them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0013.mp3|and that one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0014.mp3|the cholera|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0015.mp3|i believe that the faculty have not yet come to the conclusion that the cholera is contagious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0016.mp3|and i am not presumptuous enough to forestall them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0017.mp3|but my people have always considered it to be so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0019.mp3|i had the first intimation of its unwelcome presence in the following abrupt and unpleasant manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0020.mp3|a spaniard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0021.mp3|an old and intimate friend of my brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0022.mp3|had supped with him one evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0023.mp3|and upon returning home had been taken ill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0024.mp3|and after a short period of intense suffering had died|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0025.mp3|so sudden and so mysterious a death gave rise to the rumour that he had been poisoned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0026.mp3|and suspicion rested for a time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0027.mp3|perhaps not unnaturally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0028.mp3|upon my brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0029.mp3|in whose company the dead man had last been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0030.mp3|anxious for many reasons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0031.mp3|the chief one perhaps the position of my brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0032.mp3|i went down to see the corpse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0033.mp3|a single glance at the poor fellow showed me the terrible truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0034.mp3|the distressed face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0035.mp3|sunken eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0036.mp3|cramped limbs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0037.mp3|and discoloured shrivelled skin were all symptoms which i had been familiar with very recently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0038.mp3|and at once i pronounced the cause of death to be cholera|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0040.mp3|even my brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0041.mp3|although it relieved him of the odium of a great crime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0042.mp3|was as annoyed as the rest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0043.mp3|but by twelve o'clock that morning one of the spaniard's friends was attacked similarly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0044.mp3|and the very people who had been most angry with me a few hours previously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0045.mp3|came to me now eager for advice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0047.mp3|the nearest approach to one was a little timid dentist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0048.mp3|who was there by accident|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0049.mp3|and who refused to prescribe for the sufferer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0050.mp3|and i was obliged to do my best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0051.mp3|selecting from my medicine chest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0052.mp3|i never travel anywhere without it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0053.mp3|what i deemed necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0054.mp3|i went hastily to the patient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0055.mp3|and at once adopted the remedies i considered fit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0056.mp3|it was a very obstinate case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0059.mp3|mustard plasters on the stomach and the back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0063.mp3|for a few days the terrible disease made such slow progress amongst us that we almost hoped it had passed on its way and spared us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0064.mp3|but all at once it spread rapidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0066.mp3|and in so great request were my services|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0068.mp3|and here i must pause to set myself right with my kind reader|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0069.mp3|he or she will not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0071.mp3|think that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0072.mp3|in narrating these incidents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0074.mp3|i do not deny it is the only thing indeed that i have to be proud of that i am pleased and gratified when i look back upon my past life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0075.mp3|and see times now and then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0076.mp3|and places here and there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0077.mp3|when and where i have been enabled to benefit my fellow creatures suffering from ills my skill could often remedy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0078.mp3|nor do i think that the kind reader will consider this feeling an unworthy one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0079.mp3|if it be so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0081.mp3|in the following pages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0082.mp3|the account of what providence has given me strength to do on larger fields of action be considered vain or egotistical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0083.mp3|still i cannot help narrating them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0084.mp3|for my share in them appears to be the one and only claim i have to interest the public ear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0085.mp3|moreover i shall be sadly disappointed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0088.mp3|for the gratification is after all a selfish one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0089.mp3|that i love to be of service to those who need a woman's help|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0090.mp3|and wherever the need arises|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0091.mp3|on whatever distant shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0092.mp3|i ask no greater or higher privilege than to minister to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0093.mp3|after this explanation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0095.mp3|it was scarcely surprising that the cholera should spread rapidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0096.mp3|for fear is its powerful auxiliary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0098.mp3|the americans and other foreigners in the place showed a brave front|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0099.mp3|but the natives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0100.mp3|constitutionally cowardly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0101.mp3|made not the feeblest show of resistance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0102.mp3|beyond filling the poor church|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0103.mp3|and making the priests bring out into the streets figures of tawdry dirty saints|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0104.mp3|supposed to possess some miraculous influence which they never exerted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0105.mp3|before which they prostrated themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0106.mp3|invoking their aid with passionate prayers and cries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0107.mp3|they did nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0108.mp3|very likely the saints would have got the credit of helping them if they had helped themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0110.mp3|reeking huts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0111.mp3|or rid the damp streets of the rotting accumulation of months|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0112.mp3|i think their chief reliance was on the yellow woman from jamaica with the cholera medicine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0113.mp3|nor was this surprising|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0114.mp3|for the spanish doctor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0115.mp3|who was sent for from panama|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0116.mp3|became nervous and frightened at the horrors around him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0117.mp3|and the people soon saw that he was not familiar with the terrible disease he was called upon to do battle with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0118.mp3|and preferred trusting to one who was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0119.mp3|it must be understood that many of those who could afford to pay for my services did so handsomely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0120.mp3|but the great majority of my patients had nothing better to give their doctress than thanks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0121.mp3|the best part of my practice lay amongst the american store and hotel keepers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0123.mp3|these latter died by scores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0124.mp3|and among them i saw some scenes of horror i would fain forget|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0125.mp3|if it were possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0126.mp3|one terrible night passed with some of them has often haunted me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0127.mp3|i will endeavour to narrate it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0128.mp3|and should the reader be supposed to think it highly coloured and doubtful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0129.mp3|i will only tell him that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0130.mp3|terrible as it seems|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0131.mp3|i saw almost as fearful scenes on the crimean peninsula among british men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0132.mp3|a few thousand miles only from comfort and plenty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0134.mp3|a short distance from the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0135.mp3|where he said some of his men were dying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0136.mp3|one in particular|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0138.mp3|a very valuable servant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0139.mp3|he was most selfishly anxious for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0142.mp3|promised me a large remuneration if i should succeed in saving him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0143.mp3|our journey was not a long one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0144.mp3|but it rained hard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0145.mp3|and the fields were flooded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0147.mp3|low hut which he called his home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0148.mp3|i would rather not see such another scene as the interior of that hut presented|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0149.mp3|its roof scarcely sheltered its wretched inmates from the searching rain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0150.mp3|its floor was the damp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0151.mp3|rank turf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0153.mp3|around|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0154.mp3|in dirty hammocks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0155.mp3|and on the damp floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0156.mp3|were the inmates of this wretched place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0157.mp3|male and female|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0158.mp3|the strong and the sick together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0159.mp3|breathing air that nearly choked me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0160.mp3|accustomed as i had grown to live in impure atmosphere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0161.mp3|for beneath the same roof the mules|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0162.mp3|more valuable to their master than his human servants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0164.mp3|their fore feet locked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0165.mp3|and beside them were heaps of saddles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0168.mp3|the groans of the sufferers and the anxiety and fear of their comrades were so painful to hear and witness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0169.mp3|that for a few minutes i felt an almost uncontrollable impulse to run out into the stormy night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0170.mp3|and flee from this plague spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0171.mp3|but the weak feeling vanished and i set about my duty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0172.mp3|the mule owner was so frightened that he did not hesitate to obey orders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0175.mp3|doors and shutters were thrown open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0176.mp3|fires were lighted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0177.mp3|and every effort made to ventilate the place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0179.mp3|with the aid of the frightened women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0180.mp3|i applied myself to my poor patients|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0181.mp3|two were beyond my skill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0182.mp3|death alone could give them relief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0183.mp3|the others i could help|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0184.mp3|but no words of mine could induce them to bear their terrible sufferings like men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0185.mp3|they screamed and groaned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0186.mp3|not like women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0188.mp3|but like children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0190.mp3|in the intervals of violent pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0192.mp3|the madonna|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0193.mp3|and all the saints of heaven whom their lives had scandalised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0194.mp3|i stayed with them until midnight and then got away for a little time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0196.mp3|before the mule master was after me again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0197.mp3|the men were worse would i return with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0198.mp3|the rain was drifting heavily on the thatched roof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0199.mp3|as it only does in tropical climates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0200.mp3|and i was tired to death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0201.mp3|but i could not resist his appeal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0203.mp3|thick boots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0204.mp3|in which i was to wade through the flooded fields|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0205.mp3|and with some difficulty i again reached the kraal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0206.mp3|i found the worst cases sinking fast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0207.mp3|one of the others had relapsed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0209.mp3|at last i restored some order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0211.mp3|with the help of the bravest of the women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0212.mp3|fixed up rude screens around the dying men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0213.mp3|but no screens could shut out from the others their awful groans and cries for the aid that no mortal power could give them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0214.mp3|so the long night passed away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0216.mp3|and then a sudden silence behind the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0217.mp3|showing that the fierce battle with death was over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0218.mp3|and who had been the victor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0221.mp3|i sat before the flickering fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0222.mp3|with my last patient in my lap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0226.mp3|scarce a year old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0227.mp3|was dying in my arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0228.mp3|and i was powerless to save it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0229.mp3|it may seem strange|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0230.mp3|but it is a fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0231.mp3|that i thought more of that little child than i did of the men who were struggling for their lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0232.mp3|and prayed very earnestly and solemnly to god to spare it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0233.mp3|but it did not please him to grant my prayer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0234.mp3|and towards morning the wee spirit left this sinful world for the home above it had so lately left|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0235.mp3|and what was mortal of the little infant lay dead in my arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0236.mp3|then it was that i began to think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0237.mp3|how the idea first arose in my mind i can hardly say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0239.mp3|if it were possible to take this little child and examine it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0240.mp3|i should learn more of the terrible disease which was sparing neither young nor old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0241.mp3|and should know better how to do battle with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0242.mp3|i was not afraid to use my baby patient thus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0243.mp3|i knew its fled spirit would not reproach me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0244.mp3|for i had done all i could for it in life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0245.mp3|had shed tears over it and prayed for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0247.mp3|and the rain had ceased|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0248.mp3|when i followed the man who had taken the dead child away to bury it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0249.mp3|and bribed him to carry it by an unfrequented path down to the river side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0250.mp3|and accompany me to the thick retired bush on the opposite bank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0251.mp3|having persuaded him thus much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0252.mp3|it was not difficult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0253.mp3|with the help of silver arguments to convince him that it would be for the general benefit and his own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0254.mp3|if i could learn from this poor little thing the secret inner workings of our common foe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0255.mp3|and ultimately he stayed by me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0256.mp3|and aided me in my first and last post mortem examination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0257.mp3|it seems a strange deed to accomplish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0258.mp3|and i am sure i could not wield the scalpel or the substitute i then used now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0259.mp3|but at that time the excitement had strung my mind up to a high pitch of courage and determination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0260.mp3|and perhaps the daily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0262.mp3|scenes of death had made me somewhat callous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0263.mp3|i need not linger on this scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0264.mp3|nor give the readers the results of my operation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0265.mp3|although novel to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0266.mp3|and decidedly useful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0267.mp3|they were what every medical man well knows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0268.mp3|we buried the poor little body beneath a piece of luxuriant turf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0270.mp3|but the knowledge i had obtained thus strangely was very valuable to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0271.mp3|and was soon put into practice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0272.mp3|but that i dreaded boring my readers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0273.mp3|i would fain give them some idea of my treatment of this terrible disease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0274.mp3|i have no doubt that at first i made some lamentable blunders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0278.mp3|i know i came across|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0281.mp3|and i dare say they have been used in their turn and found wanting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0282.mp3|the simplest remedies were perhaps the best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0284.mp3|the mercury applied externally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0286.mp3|were my usual resources|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0287.mp3|opium i rather dreaded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0288.mp3|as its effect is to incapacitate the system from making any exertion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0289.mp3|and it lulls the patient into a sleep which is often the sleep of death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0291.mp3|i would give them water in which cinnamon had been boiled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0292.mp3|one stubborn attack succumbed to an additional dose of ten grains of sugar of lead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0293.mp3|mixed in a pint of water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0295.mp3|another patient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0296.mp3|a girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0297.mp3|i rubbed over with warm oil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0300.mp3|above all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0304.mp3|and particularly to keep my patient warm about the region of the heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0305.mp3|nor did i relax my care when the disease had passed by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0306.mp3|for danger did not cease when the great foe was beaten off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0307.mp3|the patient was left prostrate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0308.mp3|strengthening medicines had to be given cautiously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0310.mp3|often of the brain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0311.mp3|would follow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0313.mp3|after all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0314.mp3|one great conclusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0315.mp3|which my practice in cholera cases enabled me to come to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0316.mp3|was the old one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0317.mp3|that few constitutions permitted the use of exactly similar remedies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0318.mp3|and that the course of treatment which saved one man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0320.mp3|if persisted in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0321.mp3|have very likely killed his brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0323.mp3|such as giddiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0326.mp3|or sunken eyes and distressed look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0327.mp3|but sometimes the substance followed its forecoming shadow so quickly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0328.mp3|and the crisis was so rapid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0329.mp3|that there was no time to apply any remedies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0330.mp3|an american carpenter complained of giddiness and sickness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0331.mp3|warning signs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0332.mp3|succeeded so quickly by the worst symptoms of cholera|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0333.mp3|that in less than an hour his face became of an indigo tint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0334.mp3|his limbs were doubled up horribly with violent cramps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0335.mp3|and he died|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0336.mp3|to the convicts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0338.mp3|these poor creatures were the lowest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0339.mp3|belonged the terrible task of burying the dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0340.mp3|a duty to which they showed the utmost repugnance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0341.mp3|not unfrequently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0342.mp3|at some fancied alarm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0343.mp3|they would fling down their burden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0344.mp3|until at last it became necessary to employ the soldiers to see that they discharged the task allotted to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0348.mp3|and very seldom was time afforded by the authorities to the survivors to pay those last offices to the departed which a spaniard and a catholic considers so important|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0350.mp3|whose pride and poverty justified many of the old spanish proverbs levelled at his caste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0351.mp3|it was when the cholera was at its height and yet he had left|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0352.mp3|perhaps on important business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0353.mp3|his wife and family and gone to panama for three days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0354.mp3|on the day after his departure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0355.mp3|the plague broke out in his house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0356.mp3|and my services were required promptly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0357.mp3|i found the miserable household in terrible alarm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0358.mp3|and yet confining their exertions to praying to a coarse black priest in a black surplice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0360.mp3|kneeling beside the couch of the spanish lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0362.mp3|the sufferer was a beautiful woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0363.mp3|suffering from a violent attack of cholera|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0364.mp3|with no one to help her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0365.mp3|or even to take from her arms the poor little child they had allowed her to retain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0366.mp3|in her intervals of comparative freedom from pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0367.mp3|her cries to the madonna and her husband were heartrending to hear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0368.mp3|i had the greatest difficulty to rout the stupid priest and his as stupid worshippers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0369.mp3|and do what i could for the sufferer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0370.mp3|it was very little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0371.mp3|and before long the unconscious spaniard was a widower|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0372.mp3|soon after the authorities came for the body|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0373.mp3|i never saw such passionate anger and despair as were shown by her relatives and servants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0374.mp3|old and young|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0375.mp3|at the intrusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0376.mp3|rage that she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0377.mp3|who had been so exalted in life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0378.mp3|should go to her grave like the poor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0379.mp3|poor clay she was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0380.mp3|orders were given to bar the door against the convict gang who had come to discharge their unpleasant duty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0381.mp3|and while all were busy decking out the unconscious corpse in gayest attire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0382.mp3|none paid any heed to me bending over the fire with the motherless child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0383.mp3|journeying fast to join its dead parent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0384.mp3|i had made more than one effort to escape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0385.mp3|for i felt more sick and wretched than at any similar scene of woe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0386.mp3|but finding exit impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0387.mp3|i turned my back upon them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0388.mp3|and attended to the dying child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0389.mp3|nor did i heed their actions until i heard orders given to admit the burial party|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0390.mp3|and then i found that they had dressed the corpse in rich white satin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0391.mp3|and decked her head with flowers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0393.mp3|and i could not help fancying that symptoms were showing themselves in me with which i was familiar enough in others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0394.mp3|leaving the dying infant to the care of its relatives when the spaniard returned he found himself widowed and childless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0395.mp3|i hastened to my brother's house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0397.mp3|i felt an unpleasant chill come over me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0398.mp3|and went to bed at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0399.mp3|other symptoms followed quickly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_04_seacole_0403.mp3|and that the cholera had attacked me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0002.mp3|and would have shown their regard for her more actively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0003.mp3|had there been any occasion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0004.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0005.mp3|when i most wanted quiet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0006.mp3|it was difficult to keep out the sympathising americans and sorrowing natives who came to inquire after me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0007.mp3|and who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0008.mp3|not content with making their inquiries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0009.mp3|and leaving their offerings of blankets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0012.mp3|must see with their own eyes what chance the yellow woman had of recovery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0013.mp3|the rickety door of my little room could never be kept shut for many minutes together|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0014.mp3|a visitor would open it silently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0015.mp3|poke his long face in with an expression of sympathy that almost made me laugh in spite of my pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0016.mp3|draw it out again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0017.mp3|between the narrowest possible opening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0018.mp3|as if he were anxious to admit as little air as he could|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0019.mp3|while another would come in bodily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0020.mp3|and after looking at me curiously and inquisitively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0021.mp3|as he would eye a horse or nigger he had some thoughts of making a bid for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0022.mp3|would help to carpet my room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0023.mp3|with the result perhaps of his meditations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0030.mp3|ma'am would as gravely give place to another and another yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0031.mp3|until i was almost inclined to throw something at them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0032.mp3|or call them bad names|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0033.mp3|like the scotch king does the ghosts in the play|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0036.mp3|the attack was a very mild one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0037.mp3|and by the next day all danger had gone by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0038.mp3|although i still felt weak and exhausted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0039.mp3|after a few weeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0040.mp3|the first force of the cholera was spent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0041.mp3|and although it lingered with us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0042.mp3|as though loath to leave so fine a resting place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0043.mp3|for some months|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0044.mp3|it no longer gave us much alarm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0047.mp3|and the terrible past was conveniently forgotten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0048.mp3|perhaps it is so everywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0050.mp3|old houses found new masters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0051.mp3|the mules new drivers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0052.mp3|the great spaniard chose another pretty woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0053.mp3|and had a grand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0055.mp3|dirty wedding|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0056.mp3|and was married by the same lazy black priest who had buried his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0057.mp3|dead a few months back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0059.mp3|had circumstances permitted them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0060.mp3|but every now and then one of them sickened and died of the old complaint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0061.mp3|and the reputation i had established founded for me a considerable practice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0062.mp3|the americans in the place gladly retained me as their medical attendant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0063.mp3|and in one way or other gave me plenty to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0065.mp3|in addition to this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0067.mp3|right opposite my brother's independent hotel there was a place to let which it was considered i could adapt to my purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0068.mp3|it was a mere tumble down hut|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0069.mp3|with wattled sides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0070.mp3|and a rotten thatched roof|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0071.mp3|containing two rooms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0072.mp3|one small enough to serve as a bedroom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0073.mp3|for this charming residence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0074.mp3|very openly situated and well ventilated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0075.mp3|twenty pounds a month was considered a fair and by no means exorbitant rent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0076.mp3|and yet i was glad to take possession of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0077.mp3|and in a few days had hung its rude walls with calico of gayest colour in stripes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0078.mp3|with an exuberance of fringes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0080.mp3|and bows the americans love show dearly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0081.mp3|and prepared it to accommodate fifty dinner guests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0083.mp3|and that i would receive no lodgers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0085.mp3|and once only|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0086.mp3|i relaxed this rule in favour of two american women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0087.mp3|who sent me to sleep by a lengthy quarrel of words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0089.mp3|and left in the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0091.mp3|i had on my staff my black servant mac|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0092.mp3|the little girl i have before alluded to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0093.mp3|and a native cook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0094.mp3|i had had many opportunities of seeing how my brother conducted his business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0095.mp3|and adopted his tariff of charges|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0096.mp3|for an ordinary dinner my charge was four shillings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0097.mp3|eggs and chickens were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0098.mp3|as i have before said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0099.mp3|distinct luxuries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0100.mp3|and fetched high prices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0104.mp3|and lima|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0105.mp3|as well as california and america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0107.mp3|only twenty miles in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0108.mp3|but the journey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0109.mp3|from the want of roads and the roughness of the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0110.mp3|was a most fatiguing one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0111.mp3|in some parts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0112.mp3|as i found when i made the journey in company with my brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0113.mp3|it was almost impassable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0114.mp3|and for more than half the distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0115.mp3|three miles an hour was considered splendid progress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0116.mp3|the great majority of the travellers were rough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0117.mp3|rude men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0120.mp3|the others were more civilized and more dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0122.mp3|although i made money rapidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0123.mp3|and pressed my brother to return to kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0124.mp3|poor fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0125.mp3|it would have been well for him had he done so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0126.mp3|for he stayed only to find a grave on the isthmus of panama|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0128.mp3|and it was often very difficult for an unprotected female to manage them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0129.mp3|although i always did my best to put them in good humour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0130.mp3|among other comforts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0131.mp3|i used to hire a black barber|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0132.mp3|for the rather large consideration of two pounds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0133.mp3|to shave my male guests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0134.mp3|you can scarcely conceive the pleasure and comfort an american feels in a clean chin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0137.mp3|and there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0138.mp3|well provided with towels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0139.mp3|and armed with plenty of razors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0140.mp3|a brush of extraordinary size|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0143.mp3|the rivalry to get within reach of his huge brush was very great|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0144.mp3|and the threats used by the neglected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0145.mp3|when the grinning black was considered guilty of any interested partiality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0146.mp3|were of the fiercest description|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0148.mp3|many of them well known to us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0149.mp3|for they travelled backwards and forwards across the isthmus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0150.mp3|hanging on to the foolish gold finders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0151.mp3|attacked the dinner very often with great lack of decency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0152.mp3|it was no use giving them carving knives and forks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0153.mp3|for very often they laid their own down to insert a dirty hairy hand into a full dish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0154.mp3|while the floor soon bore evidences of the great national american habit of expectoration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0155.mp3|very often quarrels would arise during the progress of dinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0156.mp3|and more than once i thought the knives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0157.mp3|which they nearly swallowed at every mouthful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0158.mp3|would have been turned against one another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0160.mp3|i always thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0161.mp3|extremely fortunate that the reckless men rarely stimulated their excitable passions with strong drink|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0162.mp3|tea and coffee were the common beverages of the americans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0164.mp3|and men of other nations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0165.mp3|being generally distinguishable by their demand for wine and spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0166.mp3|but the yankee's capacity for swilling tea and coffee was prodigious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0167.mp3|i saw one man drink ten cups of coffee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0168.mp3|and finding his appetite still unsatisfied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0169.mp3|i ran across to my brother for advice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0170.mp3|there was a merry twinkle in his eyes as he whispered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0171.mp3|i always put in a good spoonful of salt after the sixth cup|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0172.mp3|it chokes them off admirably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0173.mp3|it was no easy thing to avoid being robbed and cheated by the less scrupulous travellers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0176.mp3|which i will narrate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0177.mp3|hoping it may make my reader laugh as heartily as its recollection makes me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0179.mp3|thin yankee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0180.mp3|with a furtive glance of the eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0181.mp3|and an amazing appetite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0182.mp3|which he seemed nothing loath to indulge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0183.mp3|his appetite for eggs especially seemed unbounded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0184.mp3|now i have more than once said how expensive eggs were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0185.mp3|and this day they happened to be eightpence apiece|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0186.mp3|our plan was to charge every diner according to the number of shells found upon his plate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0188.mp3|i noticed how eagerly my thin guest attacked my eggs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0189.mp3|and marvelled somewhat at the scanty pile of shells before him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0190.mp3|my suspicions once excited i soon fathomed my yankee friend's dodge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0191.mp3|as soon as he had devoured the eggs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0192.mp3|he conveyed furtively the shells beneath the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0193.mp3|and distributed them impartially at the feet of his companions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0194.mp3|i gave my little black maid a piece of chalk and instructions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0195.mp3|and creeping under the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0196.mp3|she counted the scattered shells|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0197.mp3|and chalked the number on the tail of his coat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0198.mp3|and when he came up to pay his score|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0199.mp3|he gave up his number of eggs in a loud voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0200.mp3|and when i contradicted him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0202.mp3|there was a general laugh against him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0203.mp3|but there was a nasty expression in his cat like eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0204.mp3|and an unpleasant allusion to mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0205.mp3|which were not agreeable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0206.mp3|and dissuaded me from playing any more practical jokes upon the yankees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0207.mp3|i followed my brother's example closely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0208.mp3|and forbade all gambling in my hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0211.mp3|and on the isthmus generally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0212.mp3|was a business by which money was wormed out of the gold seekers and gold finders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0213.mp3|no attempt was made to render it attractive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0214.mp3|as i have seen done elsewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0215.mp3|the gambling house was often plainer than our hotels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0216.mp3|and but for the green tables|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0217.mp3|with their piles of money and gold dust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0218.mp3|watched over by a well armed determined banker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0219.mp3|and the eager gamblers around|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0220.mp3|you would not know that you were in the vicinity of a spot which the english at home designate by a very decided and extreme name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0221.mp3|a doctor casey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0224.mp3|and this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0225.mp3|although he was known to be a reckless and unscrupulous villain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0226.mp3|most of them knew that he had been hunted out of san francisco|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0227.mp3|and at that time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0228.mp3|years before the vigilance committee commenced their labours of purification|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0229.mp3|a man too bad for that city must have been a prodigy of crime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0230.mp3|and yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0231.mp3|and although he was violent tempered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0232.mp3|and had a knack of referring the slightest dispute to his revolver|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0233.mp3|his table was always crowded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0234.mp3|probably because|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0235.mp3|the greatest rogues have some good qualities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0236.mp3|he was honest in his way and played fairly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0237.mp3|occasionally some distinguished passengers passed on the upward and downward tides of rascality and ruffianism|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0241.mp3|in the full zenith of her evil fame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0242.mp3|bound for california|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0246.mp3|with fine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0248.mp3|and a determined bearing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0249.mp3|dressed ostentatiously in perfect male attire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0250.mp3|with shirt collar turned down over a velvet lapelled coat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0251.mp3|richly worked shirt front|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0252.mp3|black hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0254.mp3|and natty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0255.mp3|polished boots with spurs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0256.mp3|she carried in her hand a handsome riding whip|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0258.mp3|for an impertinent american presuming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0259.mp3|perhaps not unnaturally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0260.mp3|upon her reputation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0261.mp3|laid hold jestingly of the tails of her long coat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0262.mp3|and as a lesson received a cut across his face that must have marked him for some days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0264.mp3|and was glad when the wretched woman rode off on the following morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0265.mp3|a very different notoriety followed her at some interval of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0266.mp3|miss catherine hayes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0267.mp3|on her successful singing tour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0269.mp3|and after her came an english bishop from australia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0270.mp3|who need have been a member of the church militant to secure his pretty wife from the host of admirers she had gained during her day's journey from panama|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0272.mp3|holding life cheap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0273.mp3|as all bad men strangely do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0274.mp3|equally prepared to take or lose it upon the slightest provocation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0275.mp3|few tales of horror in panama could be questioned on the ground of improbability|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0280.mp3|when no one was by to see the dastard blow dealt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0281.mp3|terribly bullied by the americans were the boatmen and muleteers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0282.mp3|who were reviled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0284.mp3|and stabbed by these free and independent filibusters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0286.mp3|whenever any englishmen were present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0287.mp3|and in a position to interfere with success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0288.mp3|this bullying was checked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0289.mp3|and they found|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0290.mp3|instead of the poor spanish indians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0291.mp3|foemen worthy of their steel or lead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0292.mp3|i must do them credit to say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0295.mp3|it very often happened so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0299.mp3|one night i heard a great noise outside my window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0300.mp3|and on rising found a poor boatman moaning piteously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0301.mp3|and in a strange jumble of many languages begging me to help him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0302.mp3|at first i was afraid to open the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0303.mp3|on account of the noisy mob which soon joined him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0305.mp3|but at last i admitted him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0306.mp3|and found that the poor wretch's ears had been cruelly split by some hasty citizen of the united states|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0307.mp3|i stitched them up as well as i could and silenced his cries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0308.mp3|and at any time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0309.mp3|if you happened to be near the river when a crowd were arriving or departing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0310.mp3|your ears would be regaled with a choice chorus of threats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0311.mp3|of which ear splitting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0314.mp3|and the application of revolvers were the mildest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0315.mp3|against the negroes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0316.mp3|of whom there were many in the isthmus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0317.mp3|and who almost invariably filled the municipal offices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0318.mp3|and took the lead in every way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0319.mp3|the yankees had a strong prejudice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0320.mp3|but it was wonderful to see how freedom and equality elevate men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0321.mp3|and the same negro who perhaps in tennessee would have cowered like a beaten child or dog beneath an american's uplifted hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0322.mp3|would face him boldly here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0323.mp3|and by equal courage and superior physical strength cow his old oppressor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0326.mp3|and the affair sometimes assumed the character of a regular skirmish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0327.mp3|the soldiers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0328.mp3|i wish i could speak better of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0331.mp3|indolent set|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0332.mp3|more prone to use their knives than their legitimate arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0333.mp3|and bore old rusty muskets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0334.mp3|and very often marched unshod|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0335.mp3|their officers were in outward appearance a few shades superior to the men they commanded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0337.mp3|as respects military proficiency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0338.mp3|were their equals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0340.mp3|that you might commit the grossest injustice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0341.mp3|and could obtain the simplest justice only by lavish bribery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0342.mp3|and you may form some idea of our military protectors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0344.mp3|i speak of the majority and except the negroes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0346.mp3|than an honest day's work for fair wages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0347.mp3|for justice was always administered strictly to the poor natives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0348.mp3|it was only the foreigners who could evade it or purchase exemption|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0349.mp3|punishment was severe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0350.mp3|and in extreme cases the convicts were sent to carthagena|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0351.mp3|there to suffer imprisonment of a terrible character|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0354.mp3|i thought no other country could match them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0356.mp3|i generally avoided claiming the protection of the law whilst on the isthmus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0357.mp3|for i found it was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0358.mp3|as is the case in civilized england from other causes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0359.mp3|rather an expensive luxury|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_05_seacole_0361.mp3|and claimed the administration of justice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0001.mp3|and the river grew too shallow to be navigable by the boats higher up than gorgona|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0002.mp3|and then we all made preparations for a flitting to that place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0003.mp3|but before starting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0004.mp3|it appeared to be the custom for the store and hotel keepers to exchange parting visits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0005.mp3|and to many of these parties i|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0006.mp3|in virtue of my recent services to the community|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0007.mp3|received invitations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0008.mp3|the most important social meeting took place on the anniversary of the declaration of american independence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0009.mp3|at my brother's hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0010.mp3|where a score of zealous americans dined most heartily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0013.mp3|as it was an especial occasion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0014.mp3|drank champagne liberally at twelve shillings a bottle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0015.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0017.mp3|they proposed the ladies with an especial reference to myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0018.mp3|in a speech which i thought worth noting down at the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0020.mp3|sallow looking american|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0021.mp3|with a pompous and yet rapid delivery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0022.mp3|and a habit of turning over his words with his quid before delivering them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0023.mp3|and clearing his mouth after each sentence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0024.mp3|perhaps to make room for the next|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0025.mp3|i shall beg the reader to consider that the blanks express the time expended on this operation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0026.mp3|he dashed into his work at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0027.mp3|rolling up and getting rid of his sentences as he went on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0033.mp3|when the cholera was among us gentlemen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0034.mp3|not many months ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0036.mp3|from jamaica gentlemen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0037.mp3|from the isle of springs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0039.mp3|and the first is that she ain't one of us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0040.mp3|a citizen of the great united states|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0041.mp3|and the other thing is gentlemen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0045.mp3|you're all as vexed as i am that she's not wholly white|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0047.mp3|and i guess if we could bleach her by any means we would|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0048.mp3|and thus make her as acceptable in any company as she deserves to be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0051.mp3|it may be supposed that i did not need much persuasion to return thanks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0055.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0056.mp3|if my brother had not checked me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0057.mp3|i should have given them my thoughts somewhat too freely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0058.mp3|as it was i said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0060.mp3|i return you my best thanks for your kindness in drinking my health|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0062.mp3|providence evidently made me to be useful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0063.mp3|and i can't help it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0066.mp3|that i don't altogether appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0067.mp3|if it had been as dark as any nigger's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0068.mp3|i should have been just as happy and as useful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0069.mp3|and as much respected by those whose respect i value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0070.mp3|and as to his offer of bleaching me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0072.mp3|even if it were practicable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0073.mp3|decline it without any thanks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0074.mp3|as to the society which the process might gain me admission into|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0075.mp3|all i can say is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0077.mp3|judging from the specimens i have met with here and elsewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0078.mp3|i don't think that i shall lose much by being excluded from it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0081.mp3|i drink to you and the general reformation of american manners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0082.mp3|i do not think that they altogether admired my speech|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0083.mp3|but i was a somewhat privileged person|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0084.mp3|and they laughed at it good naturedly enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0085.mp3|perhaps for i was not in the best humour myself i should have been better pleased if they had been angry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0089.mp3|but i did not give up all hope of persuading my brother to leave the isthmus until the very last moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0093.mp3|seeing his fixed determination to stay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0094.mp3|i consented to remain with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0095.mp3|for he was young and often ill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0096.mp3|and set hard to work to settle myself somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0098.mp3|who had settled at gorgona|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0100.mp3|and bought it for a hundred dollars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0101.mp3|it consisted of one room only|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0104.mp3|utterly unfit for my purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0105.mp3|but i determined to set to work and build on to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0106.mp3|by no means the hazardous speculation in gorgona|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0107.mp3|where bricks and mortar are unknown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0108.mp3|that it is in england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0110.mp3|and plenty of material was procurable from the opposite bank of the river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0111.mp3|an american|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0113.mp3|lent me his boat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0114.mp3|and i hired two or three natives to cut down and shape the posts and bamboo poles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0115.mp3|directly these were raised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0117.mp3|and before long my new hotel was ready to be roofed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0118.mp3|the building process was simple enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0119.mp3|and i soon found myself in possession of a capital dining room some thirty feet in length|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0120.mp3|which was gaily hung with coloured calico|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0121.mp3|concealing all defects of construction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0122.mp3|and lighted with large oil lamps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0124.mp3|altogether|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0125.mp3|although i had to pay my labourers four shillings a day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0127.mp3|i gave the travelling world to understand that i intended to devote my establishment principally to the entertainment of ladies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0128.mp3|and the care of those who might fall ill on the route|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0129.mp3|and i found the scheme answered admirably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0130.mp3|and yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0131.mp3|although the speculation paid well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0133.mp3|and when i found my brother proof against all persuasion to quit the isthmus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0134.mp3|i began to entertain serious thoughts of leaving him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0135.mp3|nor was it altogether my old roving inclination which led me to desire a change|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0136.mp3|although i dare say it had something to do with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0137.mp3|my present life was not agreeable for a woman with the least delicacy or refinement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0139.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0140.mp3|the females who crossed my path were about as unpleasant specimens of the fair sex as one could well wish to avoid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0141.mp3|with very few exceptions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0142.mp3|those who were not bad were very disagreeable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0143.mp3|and as the majority came from the southern states of america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0144.mp3|and showed an instinctive repugnance against any one whose countenance claimed for her kindred with their slaves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0145.mp3|my position was far from a pleasant one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0146.mp3|not that it ever gave me any annoyance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0147.mp3|they were glad of my stores and comforts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0148.mp3|i made money out of their wants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0149.mp3|nor do i think our bond of connection was ever closer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0150.mp3|only this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0151.mp3|if any of them came to me sick and suffering i say this out of simple justice to myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0152.mp3|i forgot everything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0153.mp3|except that she was my sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0154.mp3|and that it was my duty to help her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0156.mp3|it is not difficult to assign a cause for this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0157.mp3|in the first place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0158.mp3|many of the negroes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0159.mp3|fugitive from the southern states|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0160.mp3|had sought refuge in this and the other states of central america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0161.mp3|where every profession was open to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0162.mp3|and as they were generally superior men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0163.mp3|evinced perhaps by their hatred of their old condition and their successful flight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0165.mp3|in the priesthood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0166.mp3|in the army|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0167.mp3|in all municipal offices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0168.mp3|the self liberated negroes were invariably found in the foremost rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0169.mp3|and the people for some reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0171.mp3|always respected them more than|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0172.mp3|and preferred them to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0173.mp3|their native rulers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0175.mp3|influenced naturally by these freed slaves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0176.mp3|who bore themselves before their old masters bravely and like men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0178.mp3|and in the second and third places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0180.mp3|bullying habits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0181.mp3|be it remembered that the crowds to california were of the lowest sorts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0183.mp3|and dreaded their schemes for annexation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0184.mp3|to such an extent was this amusingly carried|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0185.mp3|that when the american railway company took possession of navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0187.mp3|after the name of their chairman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0190.mp3|with no such place known marked upon them in the very spot for which they were intended|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0192.mp3|in addition to this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0194.mp3|and put every plaintiff out of court who described himself as residing in that unrecognised place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0195.mp3|under these circumstances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0196.mp3|my readers can easily understand that when any americans crossed the isthmus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0197.mp3|accompanied by their slaves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0199.mp3|nor were the authorities at all inclined to aid in the recapture of a runaway slave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0201.mp3|as it was necessary for the losers to go on with the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0202.mp3|the fugitive invariably escaped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0204.mp3|as it is i believe of the english|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0205.mp3|that on a slave touching its soil his chains fall from him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0206.mp3|rather than irritate so dangerous a neighbour as america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0207.mp3|this rule was rarely supported|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0208.mp3|but i remember the following instance of its successful application|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0209.mp3|a young american woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0211.mp3|and was left behind by her companions under the charge of a young negro|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0213.mp3|whom she treated most inhumanly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0214.mp3|as was evinced by the poor girl's frequent screams when under the lash|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0215.mp3|one night her cries were so distressing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0216.mp3|that gorgona could stand it no longer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0217.mp3|but broke into the house and found the chattel bound hand and foot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0219.mp3|and being severely lashed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0220.mp3|despite the threats and astonishment of the mistress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0221.mp3|they were both carried off on the following morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0223.mp3|himself a man of colour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0224.mp3|and of a very humane disposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0225.mp3|when the particulars of the case were laid before him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0226.mp3|he became strongly excited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0227.mp3|and called upon the woman to offer an explanation of her cruelty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0228.mp3|she treated it with the coolest unconcern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0229.mp3|the girl was her property|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0230.mp3|worth so many dollars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0231.mp3|and a child at new orleans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0232.mp3|had misbehaved herself and been properly corrected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0235.mp3|to interfere between an american and her property|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0236.mp3|her coolness vanished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0240.mp3|and saw the slave's face flush with delight at the judge's words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0241.mp3|she became terribly enraged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0242.mp3|made use of the most fearful threats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0243.mp3|and would have wreaked summary vengeance on her late chattel had not the clumsy soldiery interfered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0244.mp3|then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0246.mp3|she bethought herself of the girl's baby at new orleans still in her power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0248.mp3|the poor girl trembled and covered her face with her hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0249.mp3|as though to shut out some fearful sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0252.mp3|had we not persuaded her to the contrary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0253.mp3|that she would have sacrificed her newly won freedom for the child's sake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0254.mp3|but we knew very well that when the heat of passion had subsided|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0256.mp3|and at once set afloat a subscription for the purchase of the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0257.mp3|the issue of the tale i do not know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0258.mp3|as the woman was very properly removed into the interior of the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0261.mp3|porters and hangers on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0262.mp3|idlers and thieves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0263.mp3|gamblers and dancing women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0265.mp3|and plying their deadly trade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0267.mp3|and doctor casey was very nearly getting himself into serious trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0268.mp3|from too great a readiness to use his revolver|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0270.mp3|he had a better excuse for bloodshed this time than might have been found for his previous breaches of the sixth commandment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0271.mp3|among the desperadoes who frequented his gambling hut|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0272.mp3|during their short stay in gorgona|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0273.mp3|was conceived the desperate plan of putting out the lights|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0274.mp3|and upsetting casey's table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0275.mp3|trusting in the confusion to carry off the piles of money upon it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0277.mp3|but the second was frustrated by the doctor promptly firing his revolver into the dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0278.mp3|and hitting an unoffending boy in the hip|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0280.mp3|carried off all the parties they could lay hands upon including the doctor to prison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0281.mp3|and brought the wounded boy to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0282.mp3|on the following morning came a most urgent request that i would visit the imprisoned doctor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0283.mp3|i found him desperately angry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0284.mp3|but somewhat nervous too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0286.mp3|owed casey more than one grudge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0287.mp3|and had shown recently a disposition to enforce the laws|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0293.mp3|and now call him bad names|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0294.mp3|as though he'd injured you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0295.mp3|he is very ill indeed may die|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0296.mp3|so i advise you to think seriously of your position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0299.mp3|you'll surely help me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0301.mp3|he's a friend of yours and will let me out of this hole|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0304.mp3|you'll never leave me to be murdered by these bloodthirsty savages what can i do or say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0305.mp3|doctor casey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0306.mp3|i must speak the truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0307.mp3|and the ball is still in the poor lad's hip i answered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0308.mp3|for i enjoyed the fellow's fear too much to help him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0309.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0310.mp3|he sent some of his friends to the boy's father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0311.mp3|and bribed him to take the lad from my care|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0312.mp3|and send him to navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0313.mp3|to a surgeon there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0314.mp3|of course he never returned to prosecute doctor casey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0317.mp3|although he hated the man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0318.mp3|could not resist his money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_06_seacole_0319.mp3|and so set him free|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0001.mp3|still remembered in the island for its suffering and gloom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0002.mp3|i returned just in time to find my services|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0003.mp3|with many others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0005.mp3|for the yellow fever never made a more determined effort to exterminate the english in jamaica than it did in that dreadful year|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0006.mp3|so violent was the epidemic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0007.mp3|that some of my people fell victims to its fury|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0008.mp3|a thing rarely heard of before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0009.mp3|my house was full of sufferers officers their wives and children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0010.mp3|very often they were borne in from the ships in the harbour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0011.mp3|sometimes in a dying state sometimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0012.mp3|after long and distressing struggles with the grim foe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0013.mp3|to recover|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0014.mp3|habituated as i had become with death in its most harrowing forms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0015.mp3|i found these scenes more difficult to bear than any i had previously borne a part in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0016.mp3|and for this reason perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0017.mp3|that i had not only to cheer the death bed of the sufferer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0019.mp3|far more trying task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0020.mp3|to soothe the passionate grief of wife or husband left behind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0021.mp3|it was a terrible thing to see young people in the youth and bloom of life suddenly stricken down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0022.mp3|not in battle with an enemy that threatened their country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0023.mp3|but in vain contest with a climate that refused to adopt them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0024.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0025.mp3|the mother country pays a dear price for the possession of her colonies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0028.mp3|which shows itself warmest when they are sick and suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0029.mp3|i can safely appeal on this point to any one who is acquainted with life in jamaica|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0032.mp3|and which are found growing under the same circumstances which produce the ills they minister to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0033.mp3|so true is it that beside the nettle ever grows the cure for its sting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0034.mp3|i do not willingly care to dwell upon scenes of suffering and death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0035.mp3|but it is with such scenes that my life's experience has made me most familiar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0036.mp3|and it is impossible to avoid their description now and then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0037.mp3|and here i would fain record|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0038.mp3|in humble spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0039.mp3|my conclusions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0040.mp3|drawn from the bearing of those whom i have now and then accompanied a little distance on their way into the valley of the shadow of death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0041.mp3|on the awful and important question of religious feeling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0042.mp3|death is always terrible no one need be ashamed to fear it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0043.mp3|how we bear it depends much upon our constitutions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0044.mp3|i have seen some brave men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0045.mp3|who have smiled at the cruellest amputation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0046.mp3|die trembling like children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0047.mp3|while others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0048.mp3|whose lives have been spent in avoidance of the least danger or trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0049.mp3|have drawn their last painful breath like heroes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0050.mp3|striking at their foe to the last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0051.mp3|robbing him of his victory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0052.mp3|and making their defeat a triumph|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0053.mp3|but i cannot trace all the peace and resignation which i have witnessed on many death beds to temperament alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0054.mp3|although i believe it has much more to do with them than many teachers will allow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0055.mp3|i have stood by receiving the last blessings of christians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0056.mp3|and closing the eyes of those who had nothing to trust to but the mercy of a god who will be far more merciful to us than we are to one another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0057.mp3|and i say decidedly that the christian's death is the glorious one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0058.mp3|as is his life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0059.mp3|you can never find a good man who is not a worker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0060.mp3|he is no laggard in the race of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0064.mp3|and as the work of the hands earns for us sweet rest by night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0065.mp3|so does the heart's labour of a lifetime make the repose of heaven acceptable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0066.mp3|this is my experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0067.mp3|and i remember one death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0068.mp3|of a man whom i grew to love in a few short weeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0069.mp3|the thought of which stirs my heart now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0070.mp3|and has sustained me in seasons of great danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0071.mp3|for before that time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0072.mp3|if i had never feared death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0074.mp3|smiling face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0075.mp3|and this he taught me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0076.mp3|i must not tell you his name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0077.mp3|for his friends live yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0078.mp3|and have been kind to me in many ways|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0079.mp3|one of them we shall meet on crimean soil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0080.mp3|he was a young surgeon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0083.mp3|and joyous as a good man should be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0084.mp3|and when he fell ill they brought him to my house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0087.mp3|almost as fond as the poor lady his mother in england far away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0088.mp3|for some time we thought him safe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0089.mp3|but at last the most terrible symptoms of the cruel disease showed themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0090.mp3|and he knew that he must die|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0091.mp3|his thoughts were never for himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0092.mp3|but for those he had to leave behind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0093.mp3|all his pity was for them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0094.mp3|it was trying to see his poor hands tremblingly penning the last few words of leave taking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0095.mp3|trying to see how piteously the poor worn heart longed to see once more the old familiar faces of the loved ones in unconscious happiness at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0096.mp3|and yet i had to support him while this sad task was effected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0097.mp3|and to give him all the help i could|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0098.mp3|i think he had some fondness for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0101.mp3|his kind heart feigned a feeling that he saw would give me joy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0102.mp3|for i used to call him my son|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0103.mp3|my dear child and to weep over him in a very weak and silly manner perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0104.mp3|he sent for an old friend captain s|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0106.mp3|i had to listen to the dictation of his simple will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0107.mp3|his dog to one friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0108.mp3|his ring to another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0109.mp3|his books to a third|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0110.mp3|his love and kind wishes to all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0111.mp3|and that over my poor son prepared himself to die|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0112.mp3|a child in all save a man's calm courage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0113.mp3|he beckoned me to raise him in the bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0115.mp3|as i passed my arms around him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0116.mp3|he saw the tears i could not repress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0117.mp3|rolling down my brown cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0118.mp3|and thanked me with a few words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0119.mp3|let me lay my head upon your breast and so he rested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0120.mp3|now and then speaking lowly to himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0121.mp3|it's only that i miss my mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0122.mp3|but heaven's will be done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0123.mp3|he repeated this many times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0124.mp3|until the heaven he obeyed sent him in its mercy forgetfulness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0125.mp3|and his thoughts no longer wandered to his earthly home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0126.mp3|i heard glad words feebly uttered as i bent over him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0127.mp3|words about heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0130.mp3|a holy name many times repeated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0131.mp3|and then with a smile and a stronger voice home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0132.mp3|home and so in a little while my arms no longer held him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0133.mp3|i have a little gold brooch with his hair in it now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0134.mp3|i wonder what inducement could be strong enough to cause me to part with that memorial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0135.mp3|sent me by his mother some months later|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0136.mp3|with the following letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0137.mp3|my dear madam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0138.mp3|will you do me the favour to accept the enclosed trifle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0139.mp3|in remembrance of that dear son whose last moments were soothed by your kindness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0140.mp3|and as a mark of the gratitude of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0141.mp3|my dear madam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0144.mp3|i was sent for by the medical authorities to provide nurses for the sick at up park camp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0145.mp3|about a mile from kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0146.mp3|and leaving some nurses and my sister at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0147.mp3|i went there and did my best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0148.mp3|but it was little we could do to mitigate the severity of the epidemic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0149.mp3|about eight months after my return to jamaica|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0151.mp3|and having another fit of restlessness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0152.mp3|i prepared to return there myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0154.mp3|it was evening when i arrived there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0155.mp3|and my friend mister h|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0156.mp3|who came to meet me on the wharf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0157.mp3|carefully piloted me through the wretched streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0160.mp3|they had such a peculiar look about them that i stopped to ask what they were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0164.mp3|whom it's nobody's business to bury|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0165.mp3|i went to gorgona|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0166.mp3|wound up the affairs of the hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0168.mp3|before returning to navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0169.mp3|took the occasion of accompanying my brother to the town of panama|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0170.mp3|we did not go with the crowd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0171.mp3|but rode alone on mules|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0172.mp3|taking with us three native guides on foot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0173.mp3|and although the distance was not much over twenty miles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0174.mp3|and we started at daybreak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0175.mp3|we did not reach panama until nightfall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0176.mp3|but far from being surprised at this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0177.mp3|my chief wonder was that we ever succeeded in getting over the journey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0178.mp3|through sand and mud over hill and plain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0179.mp3|through thick forests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0181.mp3|and over rapid streams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0183.mp3|the road sometimes being made of logs of wood laid transversely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0184.mp3|with faggots stuffed between|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0185.mp3|while here and there we had to work our way through a tangled network of brushwood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0187.mp3|we found panama an old fashioned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0188.mp3|irregular town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0189.mp3|with queer stone houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0190.mp3|almost all of which had been turned by the traders into stores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0191.mp3|on my return to navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0194.mp3|i did not find that society had improved much in my absence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0195.mp3|indeed it appeared to have grown more lawless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0196.mp3|endless quarrels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0197.mp3|often resulting in bloodshed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0198.mp3|took place between the strangers and the natives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0199.mp3|and disturbed the peace of the town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0200.mp3|once the spanish were incensed to such an extent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0201.mp3|that they planned a general rising against the foreigners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0202.mp3|and but for the opportune arrival of an english war steamer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0203.mp3|the consequences might have been terrible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0204.mp3|the americans were well armed and ready|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0205.mp3|but the native population far outnumbered them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0208.mp3|escribanos|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0209.mp3|about seventy miles from navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0210.mp3|i made the journey there in a little vessel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0211.mp3|all communication by land from navy bay being impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0212.mp3|on account of the thick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0213.mp3|dense forests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0214.mp3|that would have resisted the attempts of an army to cut its way through them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0215.mp3|as i was at this place for some months altogether|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0216.mp3|and as it was the only portion of my life devoted to gold seeking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0220.mp3|information uninteresting enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0221.mp3|i have little doubt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0222.mp3|to all but a very few of my readers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0223.mp3|it lies near the mouth of a rivulet bearing that name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0224.mp3|which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0226.mp3|runs away to the sea on its own account|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0227.mp3|about a mile from the mouth of that river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0228.mp3|it is a great neighbourhood for gold mines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0229.mp3|and about that time companies and private individuals were trying hard to turn them to good account|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0230.mp3|near it is the fort bowen mine and several others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0231.mp3|some yielding silver others gold ore in small quantities|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0236.mp3|legends were rife at that time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0237.mp3|and they may be revived at no distant date|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0241.mp3|and many other indian villages on their banks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0242.mp3|which in times gone by had yielded up golden treasures to the old world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0244.mp3|and it can only prove successful if more economical methods can be discovered than those now used for that purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0245.mp3|carlos alexander|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0247.mp3|had made a good thing out of the gold mania|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0248.mp3|the mine had belonged to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0249.mp3|had been sold at a fine price|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0250.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0251.mp3|passing through several hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0252.mp3|had at last come into possession of the company who were now working it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0254.mp3|he was a black man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0255.mp3|was fond of talking of his early life in slavery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0256.mp3|and how he had escaped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0257.mp3|and possessed no ordinary intellect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0261.mp3|which in england a well bred hound would not have accepted as a kennel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0263.mp3|and a pretty daughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0265.mp3|juliana|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0266.mp3|of this mine mister day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0267.mp3|by whose invitation when i saw him at navy bay i went there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0268.mp3|was at that time superintendent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0269.mp3|he was a distant connection of my late husband|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0270.mp3|and treated me with great kindness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0272.mp3|we met again in a far different part of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0273.mp3|and became more closely connected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0274.mp3|but i am anticipating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0276.mp3|including even the women and children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0277.mp3|worked at the mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0278.mp3|the labour was hard and disagreeable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0279.mp3|i often used to watch them at their work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0280.mp3|and would sometimes wander about by myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0281.mp3|thinking it possible that i might tumble across some gold in my rambles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0282.mp3|and i once did come upon some heavy yellow material|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0283.mp3|that brought my heart into my mouth with that strange thrilling delight which all who have hunted for the precious metal understand so well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0284.mp3|i think it was very wrong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0286.mp3|and filled some bottles with the precious dust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0287.mp3|to carry down to navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0288.mp3|i did not go for some time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0289.mp3|but when i did one of my first visits was to a gold buyer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0290.mp3|and you can imagine my feelings when he coolly laughed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0291.mp3|and told me it was some material i forget its name very like gold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0294.mp3|the worst part of it was that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0295.mp3|in my annoyance and shame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0296.mp3|i threw all i had away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0297.mp3|and among it some which i had reason to believe subsequently was genuine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0299.mp3|and when the surf ran high|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0300.mp3|impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0301.mp3|and i was once witness to a harrowing scene there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0303.mp3|manned by three sailors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0304.mp3|grounded on a rock not far from shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0305.mp3|at a terrible season|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0306.mp3|when to reach it from the land was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0307.mp3|after many attempts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0308.mp3|found impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0309.mp3|the hapless crew lingered on for two days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0310.mp3|suffering cruelly from hunger and thirst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0311.mp3|their cries ringing in our ears above the storm's pitiless fury|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0312.mp3|on the third day two of them took to the sea and were drowned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0313.mp3|the third was not strong enough to leave the boat and died in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0319.mp3|i went back to navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0320.mp3|where i laid in a good stock of the stores i should have most use for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0322.mp3|i remained there some months|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0323.mp3|pleased with the novelty of the life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0324.mp3|and busy with schemes for seeking for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0326.mp3|other mines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0327.mp3|the foreigners were just as troublesome in this little out of the way place as they were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0329.mp3|in every other part of central america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0331.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0332.mp3|alexander had hard work to maintain peace in his small kingdom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0333.mp3|and although ably seconded by mister day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0334.mp3|more than once american disregard of his sway was almost too strong for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0335.mp3|very often the few foreigners would quarrel among themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0336.mp3|and once when they came to blows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0337.mp3|and an irishman was stabbed by an american named campfield|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0338.mp3|the alcalde roused himself to punish the culprit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0339.mp3|the native population were glad enough to have an american in their power|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0340.mp3|and when i heard alexander give his men instructions to shoot the culprit if he resisted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0341.mp3|i started off to his hut|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0342.mp3|and reached it in time to prevent bloodshed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0343.mp3|he was taken and kept in confinement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0345.mp3|but we got him off for a fine of five hundred dollars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0347.mp3|a very common amusement in central america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0348.mp3|twelve sailors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0349.mp3|deserters from an american ship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0350.mp3|found their way there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0351.mp3|and before long plotted to dethrone alexander|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0352.mp3|and take possession of the mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0353.mp3|mister day gained information of their plan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0355.mp3|and arming a score of the boldest natives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0356.mp3|he surrounded the house in which they were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0357.mp3|and captured the conspirators|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0358.mp3|who were too much taken by surprise to offer resistance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0359.mp3|and sent them down to navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0360.mp3|there to be handed over to the government whose service they had left|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0361.mp3|of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0363.mp3|the place was not healthy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0364.mp3|and strangers to the climate suffered severely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0365.mp3|a surgeon himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0366.mp3|sent there by the west granada gold mining company|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0367.mp3|was glad to throw his physic to the dogs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0368.mp3|and be cured in my way by mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0369.mp3|while i was fortunately able to nurse mister day through a sharp attack of illness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0370.mp3|in consequence of the difficulty of communication with navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0372.mp3|it consisted mainly of salt meat rice and roasted indian corn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0374.mp3|and some of their delicacies were absolutely disgusting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0378.mp3|whose grilled head bore a strong resemblance to a negro baby's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0379.mp3|and yet the indians used to bring them to us for sale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0381.mp3|they were worse still stewed in soup|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0382.mp3|when it was positively frightful to dip your ladle in unsuspectingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0383.mp3|and bring up what closely resembled a brown baby's limb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0384.mp3|i got on better with the parrots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0385.mp3|and could agree with the senorita|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0387.mp3|and yet their flesh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0388.mp3|what little there was of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0389.mp3|was very coarse and hard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0390.mp3|nor did i always refuse to concede praise to a squirrel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0391.mp3|if well cooked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0392.mp3|but although the flesh of the iguana|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0393.mp3|another favourite dish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0394.mp3|was white and tender as any chicken i never could stomach it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0395.mp3|these iguanas are immense green lizards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0396.mp3|or rather moderate sized crocodiles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0397.mp3|sometimes three feet in length|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0398.mp3|but weighing generally about seven or eight pounds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0399.mp3|the indians used to bring them down in boats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0400.mp3|alive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0401.mp3|on their backs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0402.mp3|with their legs tied behind them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0403.mp3|so that they had the most comical look of distress it is possible to imagine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0404.mp3|the spanish indians have a proverb referring to an iguana so bound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0405.mp3|the purport of which has slipped from my memory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0406.mp3|but which shows the habit to be an old one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0407.mp3|their eggs are highly prized|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0408.mp3|and their captors have a cruel habit of extracting these delicacies from them while alive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0409.mp3|and roughly sewing up the wound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0412.mp3|the sea had its fair share of sharks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0413.mp3|while on land you too often met with snakes and other venomous reptiles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0414.mp3|the sting of some of them was very dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0415.mp3|one man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0417.mp3|swelled to an enormous size|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0418.mp3|and bled even at the roots of his hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0419.mp3|the remedy of the natives appeared to be copious bleeding|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0421.mp3|in company with a gentleman named little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0424.mp3|into the interior of the country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0425.mp3|for a short distance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0427.mp3|this was for the purpose of prospecting a mine on that river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0428.mp3|said to be obtainable at an easy price|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0429.mp3|its course was a very winding one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0430.mp3|and we often had to leave the canoe and walk through the shallow waters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0431.mp3|that every now and then interfered with our progress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0432.mp3|as we progressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0433.mp3|little carefully sounded the channel of the river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0434.mp3|with the view of ascertaining to what extent it was navigable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0435.mp3|the tropical scenery was very grand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0437.mp3|at least that is foremost in my memory now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0438.mp3|i know i wondered much what motive nature could have had in twisting the roots and branches of the trees into such strange fantastic contortions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0439.mp3|i watched with unfailing interest the birds and animals we disturbed in our progress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0441.mp3|that went tearing through the brushwood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0442.mp3|to the tiniest bright hued bird that dashed like a flash of many coloured fire before our eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0443.mp3|and very much surprised was i when the indians stopped before a large tree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0445.mp3|there exuded a thick creamy liquid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0446.mp3|which they wished me to taste|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0447.mp3|saying that this was the famous milk tree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0448.mp3|i needed some persuasion at first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0449.mp3|but when i had tasted some upon a biscuit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0450.mp3|i was so charmed with its flavour that i should soon have taken more than was good for me had not mister little interfered with some judicious advice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0451.mp3|we reached the mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0452.mp3|and brought back specimens of the quartz|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0453.mp3|some of which i have now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0455.mp3|and stopping but a short time at navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0456.mp3|came on direct to england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0457.mp3|i had claims on a mining company which are still unsatisfied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0461.mp3|i had long been troubled with a secret desire to embark in a very novel speculation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0462.mp3|about which i have as yet said nothing to the reader|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0464.mp3|i may be allowed to write a few words on the present aspect of affairs on the isthmus of panama|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0465.mp3|recent news from america bring the intelligence that the government of the united states has at length succeeded in finding a reasonable excuse for exercising a protectorate over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0466.mp3|or in other words annexing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0467.mp3|the isthmus of panama|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0469.mp3|this intelligence can give no surprise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0470.mp3|our only wonder being that some such excuse was not made years ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0471.mp3|at this crisis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0474.mp3|if not value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0476.mp3|but not much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0477.mp3|and i found very much more to condemn most unequivocally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0478.mp3|whatever was of any worth in their institutions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0479.mp3|such as their comparative freedom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0480.mp3|religious toleration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0482.mp3|was owing mainly to the negroes who had sought the protection of the republic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0483.mp3|i found the spanish indians treacherous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0486.mp3|with no higher aim or object but simply to enjoy the present after their own torpid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0487.mp3|useless fashion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0488.mp3|like most fallen nations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0489.mp3|they are very conservative in their habits and principles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0490.mp3|while the blacks are enterprising|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0491.mp3|and in their opinions incline not unnaturally to democracy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0492.mp3|but for their old antipathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0493.mp3|there is no doubt that the negroes would lean towards america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0495.mp3|and foster it in every way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0497.mp3|until it has become necessary for an american force to garrison those towns|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0498.mp3|for humanity and civilization's sake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0499.mp3|there can be little doubt as to the expediency of this step|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0500.mp3|but i should not be at all surprised to hear that the republic was preparing to make some show of resistance against its powerful brother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0502.mp3|as the reader will have perceived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0504.mp3|and they do not know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0505.mp3|as we do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_07_seacole_0506.mp3|how little real sympathy the government of the united states has with the extreme class of its citizens who have made themselves so conspicuous in the great high road to california|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0001.mp3|as narrated in the last chapter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0002.mp3|war had been declared against russia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0003.mp3|and we were all anxiously expecting news of a descent upon the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0005.mp3|no sooner had i heard of war somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0006.mp3|than i longed to witness it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0007.mp3|and when i was told that many of the regiments i had known so well in jamaica had left england for the scene of action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0008.mp3|the desire to join them became stronger than ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0009.mp3|i used to stand for hours in silent thought before an old map of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0010.mp3|in a little corner of which some one had chalked a red cross|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0011.mp3|to enable me to distinguish where the crimea was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0012.mp3|and as i traced the route thither all difficulties would vanish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0013.mp3|but when i came to talk over the project with my friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0014.mp3|the best scheme i could devise seemed so wild and improbable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0015.mp3|that i was fain to resign my hopes for a time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0016.mp3|and so started for navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0017.mp3|but all the way to england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0018.mp3|from navy bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0019.mp3|i was turning my old wish over and over in my mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0020.mp3|and when i found myself in london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0021.mp3|in the autumn of eighteen fifty four|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0022.mp3|just after the battle of alma had been fought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0023.mp3|and my old friends were fairly before the walls of sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0026.mp3|but was considered so wild and unprofitable a speculation in london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0027.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0028.mp3|as time wore on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0029.mp3|the inclination to join my old friends of the ninety seventh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0031.mp3|and other regiments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0032.mp3|battling with worse foes than yellow fever or cholera|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0033.mp3|took such exclusive possession of my mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0034.mp3|that i threw over the gold speculation altogether|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0035.mp3|and devoted all my energies to my new scheme|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0036.mp3|heaven knows it was visionary enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0037.mp3|i had no friends who could help me in such a project|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0039.mp3|who would understand why i desired to go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0040.mp3|and what i desired to do when i got there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0042.mp3|although they might|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0043.mp3|carefully husbanded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0044.mp3|carry me over the three thousand miles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0046.mp3|would not support me there long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0047.mp3|while to persuade the public that an unknown creole woman would be useful to their army before sebastopol was too improbable an achievement to be thought of for an instant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0048.mp3|circumstances however assisted me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0049.mp3|as the winter wore on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0050.mp3|came hints from various quarters of mismanagement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0052.mp3|and suffering in the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0054.mp3|and the fearful storm of the fourteenth of november|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0055.mp3|the worst anticipations were realized|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0056.mp3|then we knew that the hospitals were full to suffocation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0057.mp3|that scarcity and exposure were the fate of all in the camp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0058.mp3|and that the brave fellows for whom any of us at home would have split our last shilling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0059.mp3|and shared our last meal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0060.mp3|were dying thousands of miles away from the active sympathy of their fellow countrymen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0062.mp3|fought by a handful of fasting and enfeebled men against eight times their number of picked russians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0063.mp3|brought fresh and animated to the contest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0064.mp3|and while all england was reeling beneath the shock of that fearful victory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0065.mp3|came the sad news that hundreds were dying whom the russian shot and sword had spared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0068.mp3|the ship loads of sick and wounded which were sent to them across the stormy black sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0069.mp3|but directly england knew the worst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0070.mp3|she set about repairing her past neglect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0071.mp3|in every household busy fingers were working for the poor soldier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0072.mp3|money flowed in golden streams wherever need was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0073.mp3|and christian ladies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0074.mp3|mindful of the sublime example|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0077.mp3|need i be ashamed to confess that i shared in the general enthusiasm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0079.mp3|and pestilence most rife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0080.mp3|i had seen much of sorrow and death elsewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0081.mp3|but they had never daunted me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0082.mp3|and if i could feel happy binding up the wounds of quarrelsome americans and treacherous spaniards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0083.mp3|what delight should i not experience if i could be useful to my own sons suffering for a cause it was so glorious to fight and bleed for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0084.mp3|i never stayed to discuss probabilities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0085.mp3|or enter into conjectures as to my chances of reaching the scene of action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0086.mp3|i made up my mind that if the army wanted nurses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0087.mp3|they would be glad of me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0088.mp3|and with all the ardour of my nature|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0089.mp3|which ever carried me where inclination prompted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0090.mp3|i decided that i would go to the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0091.mp3|and go i did as all the world knows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0092.mp3|of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0093.mp3|had it not been for my old strong mindedness which has nothing to do with obstinacy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0096.mp3|i should have given up the scheme a score of times in as many days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0097.mp3|so regularly did each successive day give birth to a fresh set of rebuffs and disappointments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0098.mp3|i shall make no excuse to my readers for giving them a pretty full history of my struggles to become a crimean heroine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0099.mp3|my first idea and knowing that i was well fitted for the work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0100.mp3|and would be the right woman in the right place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0101.mp3|the reader can fancy my audacity was to apply to the war office for the post of hospital nurse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0102.mp3|among the diseases which i understood were most prevalent in the crimea were cholera|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0105.mp3|all of them more or less known in tropical climates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0106.mp3|and with which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0107.mp3|as the reader will remember|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0108.mp3|my panama experience had made me tolerably familiar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0110.mp3|no one will accuse me of presumption|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0111.mp3|if i say that i thought and so it afterwards proved that my knowledge of these human ills would not only render my services as a nurse more valuable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0112.mp3|but would enable me to be of use to the overworked doctors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0113.mp3|that others thought so too i took with me ample testimony|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0129.mp3|so i made long and unwearied application at the war office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0130.mp3|in blissful ignorance of the labour and time i was throwing away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0131.mp3|i have reason to believe that i considerably interfered with the repose of sundry messengers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0133.mp3|to an alarming degree|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0134.mp3|the official gravity of some nice gentlemanly young fellows|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0137.mp3|but my ridiculous endeavours to gain an interview with the secretary at war of course failed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0138.mp3|and glad at last to oblige a distracted messenger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0140.mp3|here i saw another gentleman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0141.mp3|who listened to me with a great deal of polite enjoyment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0142.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0143.mp3|his amusement ended|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0144.mp3|hinted had i not better apply to the medical department|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0145.mp3|and accordingly i attached myself to their quarters with the same unwearying ardour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0146.mp3|but of course i grew tired at last and then i changed my plans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0149.mp3|suffering from cholera|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0151.mp3|and a host of lesser ills|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0153.mp3|where people know our use|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0154.mp3|it would have been different|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0155.mp3|but here it was natural enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0156.mp3|although i had references and other voices spoke for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0157.mp3|that they should laugh good naturedly enough at my offer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0160.mp3|is a serious game|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0161.mp3|but sometimes very humble actors are of great use in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0162.mp3|and if the reader|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0163.mp3|when he comes in time to peruse the evidence of those who had to do with the sebastopol drama|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0164.mp3|of my share in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0165.mp3|will turn back to this chapter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0166.mp3|he will confess perhaps that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0168.mp3|the impulse which led me to the war department was not unnatural|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0169.mp3|my new scheme was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0170.mp3|i candidly confess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0172.mp3|miss nightingale had left england for the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0173.mp3|but other nurses were still to follow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0176.mp3|feeling that i was one of the very women they most wanted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0177.mp3|experienced and fond of the work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0180.mp3|the army agents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0181.mp3|who were most obliging to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0183.mp3|did not take long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0185.mp3|i laid the same pertinacious siege to his great house in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0186.mp3|square as i had previously done to his place of business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0187.mp3|many a long hour did i wait in his great hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0188.mp3|while scores passed in and out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0189.mp3|many of them looking curiously at me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0190.mp3|the flunkeys noble creatures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0191.mp3|marvelled exceedingly at the yellow woman whom no excuses could get rid of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0192.mp3|nor impertinence dismay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0193.mp3|and showed me very clearly that they resented my persisting in remaining there in mute appeal from their sovereign will|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0196.mp3|and that my offer could not be entertained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0197.mp3|once again i tried|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0198.mp3|and had an interview this time with one of miss nightingale's companions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0199.mp3|she gave me the same reply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0200.mp3|and i read in her face the fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0201.mp3|that had there been a vacancy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0202.mp3|i should not have been chosen to fill it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0203.mp3|as a last resort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0204.mp3|i applied to the managers of the crimean fund to know whether they would give me a passage to the camp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0205.mp3|once there i would trust to something turning up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0206.mp3|but this failed also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0207.mp3|and one cold evening i stood in the twilight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0209.mp3|and looked back upon the ruins of my last castle in the air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0210.mp3|the disappointment seemed a cruel one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0211.mp3|i was so conscious of the unselfishness of the motives which induced me to leave england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0213.mp3|and yet i found it so difficult to convince others of these facts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0214.mp3|doubts and suspicions arose in my heart for the first and last time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0215.mp3|thank heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0216.mp3|was it possible that american prejudices against colour had some root here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0217.mp3|did these ladies shrink from accepting my aid because my blood flowed beneath a somewhat duskier skin than theirs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0218.mp3|tears streamed down my foolish cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0219.mp3|as i stood in the fast thinning streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0220.mp3|tears of grief that any should doubt my motives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0221.mp3|that heaven should deny me the opportunity that i sought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0222.mp3|then i stood still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0223.mp3|and looking upward through and through the dark clouds that shadowed london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0224.mp3|prayed aloud for help|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0225.mp3|i dare say that i was a strange sight to the few passers by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0227.mp3|i dare say those who read these pages will wonder at me as much as they who saw me did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0229.mp3|and find it hard to put that restraint upon my feelings which to you is so easy and natural|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0232.mp3|let what might happen to the crimea i would go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0233.mp3|if in no other way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0234.mp3|then would i upon my own responsibility and at my own cost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0235.mp3|there were those there who had known me in jamaica|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0236.mp3|who had been under my care|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0237.mp3|doctors who would vouch for my skill and willingness to aid them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0238.mp3|and a general who had more than once helped me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0239.mp3|and would do so still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0241.mp3|if the authorities had allowed me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0242.mp3|i would willingly have given them my services as a nurse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0243.mp3|but as they declined them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0245.mp3|i had no more idea of what the crimea was than the home authorities themselves perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0246.mp3|but having once made up my mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0247.mp3|it was not long before cards were printed and speeding across the mediterranean to my friends before sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0251.mp3|respectfully announces to her former kind friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0252.mp3|and to the officers of the army and navy generally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0253.mp3|that she has taken her passage in the screw steamer hollander to start from london on the twenty fifth of january|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0256.mp3|at a time when any officer would have considered a stall in an english stable luxurious quarters compared to those he possessed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0257.mp3|and had nearly forgotten the comforts of a mess table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0258.mp3|it must have read to them rather like a mockery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0259.mp3|and yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0260.mp3|as the reader will see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0261.mp3|i succeeded in redeeming my pledge|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0262.mp3|while this new scheme was maturing i again met mister day in england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0270.mp3|these new arrangements were not allowed to interfere in any way with the main object of my journey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0271.mp3|a great portion of my limited capital was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0272.mp3|with the kind aid of a medical friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0273.mp3|invested in medicines which i had reason to believe would be useful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0274.mp3|with the remainder i purchased those home comforts which i thought would be most difficult to obtain away from england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0275.mp3|i had scarcely set my foot on board the hollander before i met a friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0276.mp3|the supercargo was the brother of the mister s|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0277.mp3|whose death in jamaica the reader will not have forgotten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0278.mp3|and he gave me a hearty welcome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0280.mp3|and when i told him my plans he gave me the most cheering encouragement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0286.mp3|my project was a hazardous one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0287.mp3|so cheered at the outset|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0288.mp3|i watched without a pang the shores of england sink behind the smooth sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0289.mp3|and turned my gaze hopefully to the as yet landless horizon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_08_seacole_0290.mp3|beyond which lay that little peninsula to which the eyes and hearts of all england were so earnestly directed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0002.mp3|it was a very interesting one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0004.mp3|as i am a good sailor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0006.mp3|the weather|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0008.mp3|was fine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0010.mp3|and i enjoyed the voyage amazingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0011.mp3|and as day by day we drew nearer to the scene of action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0012.mp3|my doubts of success grew less and less|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0013.mp3|until i had a conviction of the rightness of the step i had taken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0014.mp3|which would have carried me buoyantly through any difficulties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0019.mp3|with the white convent walls on the cliffs above bathed in the early sunlight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0020.mp3|i never failed to take an almost childish interest in the signals which passed between the hollander and the fleet of vessels whose sails whitened the track to and from the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0021.mp3|trying to puzzle out the language these children of the ocean spoke in their hurried course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0022.mp3|and wondering whether any|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0023.mp3|or what sufficiently important thing could happen which would warrant their stopping on their busy way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0024.mp3|we spent a short time at gibraltar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0026.mp3|i had an idea that i should do better alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0027.mp3|so i declined all offers of companionship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0029.mp3|saw more of the art of fortification in an hour or so than i could understand in as many years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0030.mp3|the pleasure was rather fatiguing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0031.mp3|and i was not sorry to return to the market place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0032.mp3|where i stood curiously watching its strange and motley population|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0033.mp3|while so engaged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0034.mp3|i heard for the first time an exclamation which became familiar enough to me afterwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0036.mp3|bless my soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0037.mp3|old fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0039.mp3|and saw two officers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0040.mp3|whose features|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0041.mp3|set in a broad frame of crimean beard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0043.mp3|but i soon remembered that they were two of the forty eighth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0044.mp3|who had been often in my house at kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0045.mp3|glad were the kind hearted fellows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0046.mp3|and not a little surprised withal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0047.mp3|to meet their old hostess in the market place of gibraltar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0048.mp3|bound for the scene of action which they had left invalided|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0049.mp3|and it was not long before we were talking old times over some wine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0050.mp3|spanish i suppose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0051.mp3|but it was very nasty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0052.mp3|and you are going to the front old lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0053.mp3|you of all people in the world why not my sons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0055.mp3|yes mother answered one an irishman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0056.mp3|it isn't many women god bless them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0057.mp3|we've had to spoil us out there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0058.mp3|but it's not the place even for you who know what hardship is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0060.mp3|nor on the road either|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0061.mp3|so they rattled on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0062.mp3|telling me of the difficulties that were in store for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0063.mp3|but they could not shake my resolution|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0064.mp3|do you think i shall be of any use to you when i get there surely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0065.mp3|then i'll go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0066.mp3|were the place a hundred times worse than you describe it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0067.mp3|can't i rig up a hut with the packing cases|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0072.mp3|and drank success to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0073.mp3|and to our next meeting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0077.mp3|for all the hardships they had passed through|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0078.mp3|we stopped at malta also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0082.mp3|and stared about me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0084.mp3|here also i met friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0085.mp3|some medical officers who had known me in kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0086.mp3|and one of them doctor f|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0089.mp3|when he heard my plans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0090.mp3|a letter of introduction to miss nightingale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0091.mp3|then hard at work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0092.mp3|evoking order out of confusion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0093.mp3|and bravely resisting the despotism of death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0096.mp3|past beautiful islands and shores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0097.mp3|until we are steaming against a swift current|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0098.mp3|and an adverse wind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0099.mp3|between two tower crested promontories of rock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0100.mp3|which they tell me stand in europe and in asia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0103.mp3|travel where a woman may|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0105.mp3|or the old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0107.mp3|old tale everywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0108.mp3|it is the one bond of sympathy which i have found existing in three quarters of the world alike|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0109.mp3|so on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0110.mp3|until the cable rattles over the windlass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0111.mp3|as the good ship's anchor plunges down fathoms deep into the blue waters of the bosphorus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0112.mp3|her voyage ended|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0113.mp3|i do not think that constantinople impressed me so much as i had expected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0114.mp3|and i thought its streets would match those of navy bay not unfairly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0116.mp3|for i spent six days here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0118.mp3|and returning to the hollander at nightfall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0119.mp3|might be made more safe and commodious for stout ladies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0120.mp3|even if the process interfered a little with their ornament|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0121.mp3|time and trouble combined have left me with a well filled out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0122.mp3|portly form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0123.mp3|the envy of many an angular yankee female|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0126.mp3|it was in no slight danger of becoming too intimately acquainted with the temperature of the bosphorus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0129.mp3|and for the same reason perhaps would admit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0132.mp3|seemed the cunning eyed greeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0133.mp3|who throng the streets of pera|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0134.mp3|at the unprotected creole woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0135.mp3|who took constantinople so coolly it would require something more to surprise her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0136.mp3|while the grave english raised their eyebrows wonderingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0137.mp3|and the more vivacious french shrugged their pliant shoulders into the strangest contortions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0138.mp3|i accepted it all as a compliment to a stout female tourist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0139.mp3|neatly dressed in a red or yellow dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0140.mp3|a plain shawl of some other colour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0141.mp3|and a simple straw wide awake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0142.mp3|with bright red streamers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0143.mp3|i flatter myself that i woke up sundry sleepy eyed turks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0144.mp3|who seemed to think that the great object of life was to avoid showing surprise at anything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0145.mp3|while the turkish women gathered around me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0146.mp3|and jabbered about me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0147.mp3|in the most flattering manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0148.mp3|how i ever succeeded in getting mister day's letters from the post office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0150.mp3|puzzles me now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0151.mp3|but i did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0152.mp3|and i shall ever regard my success as one of the great triumphs of my life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0153.mp3|their contents were not very cheering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0155.mp3|and almost dissuaded me from continuing my journey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0156.mp3|but his last letter ended by giving me instructions as to the purchases i had best make|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0157.mp3|if i still determined upon making the adventure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0158.mp3|so i forgot all the rest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0159.mp3|and busied myself in laying in the stores he recommended|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0160.mp3|but i found time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0163.mp3|intending to present doctor f|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0166.mp3|and i walked up the slight ascent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0167.mp3|to the great dull looking hospital|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0169.mp3|or had painfully crept along this path|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0170.mp3|only to die within that dreary building|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0171.mp3|i felt rather dull|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0172.mp3|and directly i entered the hospital|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0173.mp3|and came upon the long wards of sufferers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0174.mp3|lying there so quiet and still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0175.mp3|a rush of tears came to my eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0176.mp3|and blotted out the sight for a few minutes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0177.mp3|but i soon felt at home and looked about me with great interest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0179.mp3|some of the convalescent formed themselves into little groups around one who read a newspaper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0182.mp3|where they had fallen when slumber overtook the readers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0183.mp3|while hospital orderlies moved to and fro|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0184.mp3|and now and then the female nurses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0185.mp3|in their quiet uniform|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0186.mp3|passed noiselessly on some mission of kindness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0187.mp3|i was fortunate enough to find an old acquaintance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0188.mp3|who accompanied me through the wards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0189.mp3|and rendered it unnecessary for me to trouble the busy nurses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0190.mp3|this was an old ninety seventh man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0191.mp3|a sergeant t|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0192.mp3|whom i had known in kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0193.mp3|and who was slowly recovering from an attack of dysentery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0195.mp3|he is very glad to meet me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0196.mp3|and tells me his history very socially|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0197.mp3|and takes me to the bedsides of some comrades|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0199.mp3|my poor fellows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0200.mp3|how their eyes glisten when they light upon an old friend's face in these turkish barracks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0201.mp3|put to so sad a use three thousand miles from home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0202.mp3|here is one of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0203.mp3|hurt in the trenches says the sergeant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0207.mp3|irish eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0211.mp3|and when he has shaken hands a score of times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0212.mp3|falls back upon his pillow very wearily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0213.mp3|but i sit by his side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0214.mp3|and try to cheer him with talk about the future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0216.mp3|and see home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0217.mp3|and hear them all thank him for what he has been helping to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0219.mp3|but hearing that i am on the way to the front gets excited again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0222.mp3|illness and weakness make these strong men as children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0223.mp3|not least in the patient unmurmuring resignation with which they suffer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0224.mp3|i think my irish friend had an indistinct idea of a muddle somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0225.mp3|which had kept him for weeks on salt meat and biscuit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0230.mp3|and it is strange to hear his almost plaintive tone as he urges this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0231.mp3|take them plenty of eggs mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0232.mp3|we never saw eggs over there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0233.mp3|at some slight risk of giving offence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0234.mp3|i cannot resist the temptation of lending a helping hand here and there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0235.mp3|replacing a slipped bandage or easing a stiff one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0236.mp3|but i do not think any one was offended|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0237.mp3|and one doctor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0238.mp3|who had with some surprise and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0240.mp3|alarm on his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0241.mp3|watched me replace a bandage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0242.mp3|which was giving pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0245.mp3|when i had finished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0248.mp3|one thought never left my mind as i walked through the fearful miles of suffering in that great hospital|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0249.mp3|if it is so here what must it not be at the scene of war|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0250.mp3|on the spot where the poor fellows are stricken down by pestilence or russian bullets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0251.mp3|and days and nights of agony must be passed before a woman's hand can dress their wounds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0252.mp3|and i felt happy in the conviction that i must be useful three or four days nearer to their pressing wants than this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0253.mp3|it was growing late before i felt tired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0255.mp3|and doctor s|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0256.mp3|another jamaica friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0258.mp3|and recommended me to present my letter to miss nightingale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0259.mp3|and perhaps a lodging for the night could be found for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0261.mp3|still under the sergeant's patient guidance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0262.mp3|we thread our way through passages and corridors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0263.mp3|all used as sick wards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0267.mp3|who saw me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0270.mp3|and apologized for troubling miss nightingale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0273.mp3|whose every moment is valuable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0274.mp3|can see me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0277.mp3|but with the same look of curiosity and surprise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0280.mp3|this is the purport of her questions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0281.mp3|and i say frankly to be of use somewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0282.mp3|for other considerations i had not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0283.mp3|until necessity forced them upon me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0284.mp3|willingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0286.mp3|i would have worked for the wounded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0287.mp3|in return for bread and water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0291.mp3|very kindly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0292.mp3|miss nightingale has the entire management of our hospital staff|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0293.mp3|but i do not think that any vacancy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0295.mp3|ma'am i interrupt her with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0297.mp3|more surprised than ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0298.mp3|the room i waited in was used as a kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0299.mp3|upon the stoves were cans of soup|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0302.mp3|while nurses passed in and out with noiseless tread and subdued manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0303.mp3|i thought many of them had that strange expression of the eyes which those who have gazed long on scenes of woe or horror seldom lose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0304.mp3|in half an hour's time i am admitted to miss nightingale's presence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0309.mp3|resting lightly in the palm of one white hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0310.mp3|while the other supports the elbow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0311.mp3|a position which gives to her countenance a keen inquiring expression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0312.mp3|which is rather marked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0313.mp3|standing thus in repose and yet keenly observant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0314.mp3|the greatest sign of impatience at any time a slight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0315.mp3|perhaps unwitting motion of the firmly planted right foot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0316.mp3|was florence nightingale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0317.mp3|that englishwoman whose name shall never die|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0319.mp3|she has read doctor f|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0321.mp3|which lies on the table by her side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0323.mp3|in her gentle but eminently practical and business like way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0327.mp3|if it lies in my power i shall be very happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0329.mp3|and the improbability of my finding the hollander in the dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0333.mp3|offering to nurse the sick for the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0334.mp3|now unfortunately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0335.mp3|for many reasons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0337.mp3|but at last a bed was discovered to be unoccupied at the hospital washerwomen's quarters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0338.mp3|my experience of washerwomen all the world over is the same|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0339.mp3|that they are kind soft hearted folks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0341.mp3|and soften them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0343.mp3|and welcomes me most heartily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0345.mp3|and after they have gone to bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0346.mp3|we spend some hours of the night talking over our adventures|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0347.mp3|and giving one another scraps of our respective biographies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0348.mp3|i hadn't long retired to my couch before i wished most heartily that we had continued our chat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0349.mp3|for unbidden and most unwelcome companions took the washerwoman's place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0350.mp3|and persisted not only in dividing my bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0351.mp3|but my plump person also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0352.mp3|upon my word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0353.mp3|i believe the fleas are the only industrious creatures in all turkey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0354.mp3|some of their relatives would seem to have migrated into russia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0355.mp3|for i found them in the crimea equally prosperous and ubiquitous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0357.mp3|a breakfast is sent to my mangled remains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0360.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0361.mp3|after an interview with some other medical men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0362.mp3|whose acquaintance i had made in jamaica|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0363.mp3|i shake hands with the soft hearted washerwoman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0364.mp3|up to her shoulders in soap suds already|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_09_seacole_0365.mp3|and start for the hollander|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0001.mp3|i was accustomed to employ|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0002.mp3|as a guide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0003.mp3|a young greek jew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0004.mp3|whose name it is no use my attempting to spell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0005.mp3|but whom i called by the one common name there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0012.mp3|how he had picked up his knowledge i cannot tell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0013.mp3|but he could talk a little broken english|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0014.mp3|besides french|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0019.mp3|as broken as his english|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0020.mp3|he attached himself very closely to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0021.mp3|and seemed very anxious to share my fortunes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0022.mp3|and after he had pleaded hard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0024.mp3|to be taken to the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0025.mp3|i gave in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0027.mp3|he was the best and faithfullest servant i had in the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0030.mp3|i should have been very badly off without him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0031.mp3|more letters come from mister day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0033.mp3|but it is too late for hesitation now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0034.mp3|my plans are perfected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0036.mp3|and passage secured in the albatross|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0038.mp3|i thought i should never have transported my things from the hollander to the albatross|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0039.mp3|it was a terrible day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0040.mp3|and against the strong current and hurricane of wind turkish and greek arms seemed of little avail|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0041.mp3|but at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0042.mp3|after an hour or more of terrible anxiety and fear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0043.mp3|the albatross's side was reached|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0044.mp3|and i clambered on deck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0046.mp3|my companions are cheerful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0047.mp3|pleasant fellows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0048.mp3|and the short|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0050.mp3|voyage across the black sea is safely made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0051.mp3|and one morning we become excited at seeing a dark rock bound coast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0053.mp3|as we steam on we see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0054.mp3|away to the right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0055.mp3|clouds of light smoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0056.mp3|which the knowing travellers tell us are not altogether natural|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0057.mp3|but show that sebastopol is not yet taken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0059.mp3|went down in that fearful november storm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0060.mp3|four short months ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0062.mp3|it does not appear the simplest favour in the world that we are applying for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0064.mp3|but at last it comes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0065.mp3|and we slowly wind through a narrow channel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0066.mp3|and emerge into a small landlocked basin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0067.mp3|so filled with shipping that their masts bend in the breeze like a wintry forest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0068.mp3|whatever might have been the case at one time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0070.mp3|and the albatross with the aid of her boats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0071.mp3|moves along to her appointed moorings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0072.mp3|such a busy scene as that small harbour presented could be rarely met with elsewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0074.mp3|of every size and variety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0075.mp3|from the noble english steamer to the smallest long shore craft|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0076.mp3|while between them and the shore passed and repassed innumerable boats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0079.mp3|greek and maltese boats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0080.mp3|carrying their owners everywhere on their missions of sharp dealing and roguery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0082.mp3|and gives one enough to think about without desiring to go on shore this afternoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0083.mp3|on the following morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0084.mp3|mister day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0085.mp3|apprised of my arrival|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0086.mp3|came on board the albatross and our plans were laid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0087.mp3|i must leave the albatross of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0089.mp3|until we decide upon our future|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0090.mp3|i had better take up my quarters on board the medora which is hired by the government|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0091.mp3|at a great cost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0092.mp3|as an ammunition ship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0093.mp3|the proposal was not a very agreeable one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0094.mp3|but i have no choice left me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0095.mp3|our stores too had to be landed at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0097.mp3|and we had to stack them upon the shore and protect them as well as we were able|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0098.mp3|my first task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0100.mp3|and solicit their aid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0102.mp3|while i sent another to captain peel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0103.mp3|who was hard at work battering the defences of sebastopol about the ears of the russians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0104.mp3|from the batteries of the royal naval brigade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0107.mp3|sir john campbell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0108.mp3|then commanding a division|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0109.mp3|and my old friends answered my letters most kindly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0111.mp3|and welcome me to the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0112.mp3|while captain peel and sir j campbell sent the kindest messages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0113.mp3|and when they saw me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0114.mp3|promised me every assistance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0115.mp3|the general adding that he is glad to see me where there is so much to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0116.mp3|among others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0118.mp3|whose kind face had so often lighted up my old house in kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0119.mp3|came to take me by the hand in this out of the way corner of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0120.mp3|i never felt so sure of the success of any step as i did of this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0122.mp3|but i had plenty of difficulties to contend with on every side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0123.mp3|among the first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0125.mp3|in which were many of our stores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0127.mp3|and there was more than a probability that she would carry back to constantinople many of the things we had most pressing occasion for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0130.mp3|that some one should see admiral boxer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0131.mp3|and try to interest that mild spoken and affable officer in our favour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0132.mp3|when i mentioned it to mister day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0133.mp3|he did not seem inclined to undertake the mission|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0134.mp3|and nothing was left but for me to face the terrible port admiral|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0135.mp3|fortunately captain h|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0136.mp3|of the diamond was inclined to be my friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0138.mp3|not a little amused with his mission|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0139.mp3|carried me right off to the admiral|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0140.mp3|i confess that i was as nearly frightened out of my wits as i ever have been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0141.mp3|for the admiral's kind heart beat under a decidedly rough husk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0142.mp3|and when captain h|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0144.mp3|as there were stores on board|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0145.mp3|he let fly enough hard words to frighten any woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0146.mp3|but when i spoke up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0147.mp3|and told him that i had known his son in the west indies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0149.mp3|and granted my petition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0150.mp3|but it was not without more hard words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0151.mp3|and much grumbling that a parcel of women should be coming out to a place where they were not wanted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0153.mp3|the admiral did not repeat this remark a few days afterwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0154.mp3|when he saw me attending the sick and wounded upon the sick wharf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0158.mp3|over our stores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0159.mp3|stacked on the shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0161.mp3|and beneath these|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0162.mp3|my sole protection against the crimean rain and wind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0163.mp3|i spent some portion of each day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0164.mp3|receiving visitors and selling stores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0165.mp3|but my chief occupation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0166.mp3|and one with which i never allowed any business to interfere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0168.mp3|i did not forget the main object of my journey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0169.mp3|to which i would have devoted myself exclusively had i been allowed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0172.mp3|the very first day that i approached the wharf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0173.mp3|a party of sick and wounded had just arrived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0174.mp3|here was work for me i felt sure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0175.mp3|with so many patients|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0176.mp3|the doctors must be glad of all the hands they could get|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0177.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0178.mp3|so strong was the old impulse within me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0179.mp3|that i waited for no permission|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0181.mp3|groaning heavily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0182.mp3|i ran up to him at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0183.mp3|and eased the stiff dressings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0184.mp3|lightly my practised fingers ran over the familiar work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0186.mp3|god help him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0187.mp3|he had been hit in the forehead and i think his sight was gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0189.mp3|and raised some tea to his baked lips here and there upon the wharf were rows of little pannikins containing this beverage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0191.mp3|and rested there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0193.mp3|as though the discovery had arrested his wandering senses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0195.mp3|this is surely a woman's hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0196.mp3|i couldn't say much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0197.mp3|but i tried to whisper something about hope and trust in god|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0198.mp3|but all the while i think his thoughts were running on this strange discovery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0199.mp3|perhaps i had brought to his poor mind memories of his home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0200.mp3|and the loving ones there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0201.mp3|who would ask no greater favour than the privilege of helping him thus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0202.mp3|for he continued to hold my hand in his feeble grasp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0203.mp3|and whisper god bless you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0205.mp3|whoever you are god bless you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0206.mp3|over and over again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0207.mp3|i do not think that the surgeons noticed me at first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0208.mp3|although|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0210.mp3|i had not neglected my personal appearance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0211.mp3|and wore my favourite yellow dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0213.mp3|with the red ribbons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0214.mp3|but i noticed one coming to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0217.mp3|would have laughed very merrily had it not been for the poor fellow at my feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0219.mp3|he came forward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0220.mp3|and shook hands very kindly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0221.mp3|saying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0224.mp3|much obliged to you for looking after my poor fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0225.mp3|very glad to see you here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0226.mp3|and glad they always were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0227.mp3|the kind hearted doctors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0228.mp3|to let me help them look after the sick and wounded sufferers brought to that fearful wharf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0229.mp3|i wonder if i can ever forget the scenes i witnessed there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0231.mp3|they were heartrending|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0232.mp3|i declare that i saw rough bearded men stand by and cry like the softest hearted women at the sights of suffering they saw|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0233.mp3|while some who scorned comfort for themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0234.mp3|would fidget about for hours before the long trains of mules and ambulances came in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0236.mp3|i have often heard men talk and preach very learnedly and conclusively about the great wickedness and selfishness of the human heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0237.mp3|i used to wonder whether they would have modified those opinions if they had been my companions for one day of the six weeks i spent upon that wharf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0238.mp3|and seen but one day's experience of the christian sympathy and brotherly love shown by the strong to the weak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0239.mp3|the task was a trying one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0240.mp3|and familiarity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0241.mp3|you might think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0242.mp3|would have worn down their keener feelings of pity and sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0243.mp3|but it was not so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0244.mp3|i was in the midst of my sad work one day when the admiral came up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0245.mp3|and stood looking on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0246.mp3|he vouchsafed no word nor look of recognition in answer to my salute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0247.mp3|but stood silently by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0248.mp3|his hands behind his back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0249.mp3|watching the sick being lifted into the boats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0250.mp3|you might have thought that he had little feeling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0251.mp3|so stern and expressionless was his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0252.mp3|but once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0254.mp3|and he groaned deeply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0255.mp3|that rough man broke out all at once with an oath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0256.mp3|that was strangely like a prayer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0259.mp3|take more care|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0262.mp3|he clapped me on the shoulder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0263.mp3|saying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0266.mp3|among these poor fellows while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0267.mp3|i am most strangely deceived if i did not see a tear drop gathering in his eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0270.mp3|that bending down over a poor fellow whose senses had quite gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0271.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0273.mp3|would never return to him in this world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0274.mp3|he took me for his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0275.mp3|and calling me mary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0276.mp3|mary many times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0277.mp3|asked me how it was he had got home so quickly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0278.mp3|and why he did not see the children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0279.mp3|and said he felt sure he should soon get better now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0280.mp3|poor fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0281.mp3|i could not undeceive him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0282.mp3|i think the fancy happily caused by the touch of a woman's hand soothed his dying hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0284.mp3|i never knew it for certain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0285.mp3|but i always felt sure that he would never wake from that dream of home in this world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0286.mp3|and here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0287.mp3|lest the reader should consider that i am speaking too highly of my own actions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0288.mp3|i must have recourse to a plan which i shall frequently adopt in the following pages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0290.mp3|by one who had not forgotten his old companion on the sick wharf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0291.mp3|the writer major then captain r|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0292.mp3|had charge of the wharf while i was there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0296.mp3|i am very sorry to hear that you have been unfortunate in business|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0297.mp3|but i am glad to hear that you have found friends in lord r|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0299.mp3|no one knows better than i do how much you did to help poor sick and wounded soldiers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0300.mp3|and i feel sure you will find in your day of trouble that they have not forgotten it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0302.mp3|was a brave and experienced officer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0304.mp3|i have known him nervously restless if the people were behindhand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0305.mp3|even for a few minutes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0306.mp3|in their preparations for the wounded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0307.mp3|but in this feeling all shared alike|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0308.mp3|only women could have done more than they did who attended to this melancholy duty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0310.mp3|not because their hearts could be softer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0311.mp3|but because their hands are moulded for this work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0313.mp3|sometimes a light hearted fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0314.mp3|generally a sailor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0315.mp3|would forget his pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0316.mp3|and do his best to keep the rest in good spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0317.mp3|once i heard my name eagerly pronounced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0318.mp3|and turning round|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0320.mp3|a few years back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0323.mp3|and i saw that the left leg was gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0325.mp3|my man i'm sorry to see you in this sad plight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0329.mp3|you don't think messmates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0330.mp3|he never left his wounded comrades alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0334.mp3|do i aunty and he seemed surprised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0337.mp3|when i've seen so many pretty fellows knocked off the ship's roll altogether|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0339.mp3|and this brave fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0340.mp3|after he had sipped some lemonade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0341.mp3|and laid down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0342.mp3|when he heard the men groaning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0343.mp3|raised his head and comforted them in the same strain again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0344.mp3|and it may seem strange but it quieted them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0345.mp3|i used to make sponge cakes on board the medora with eggs brought from constantinople|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0346.mp3|only the other day captain s|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0347.mp3|who had charge of the medora reminded me of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0349.mp3|with some lemonade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0350.mp3|were all the doctors would allow me to give to the wounded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0351.mp3|they all liked the cake poor fellows better than anything else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_10_seacole_0352.mp3|perhaps because it tasted of home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0001.mp3|the exposure by day was enough to try any woman's strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0002.mp3|and at night one was not always certain of repose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0004.mp3|why it should be so difficult to climb a ship's side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0005.mp3|when a few more staves in the ladder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0006.mp3|and those a little broader|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0007.mp3|would make it so easy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0008.mp3|i have never been able to guess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0010.mp3|it was an ammunition ship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0011.mp3|and we slept over barrels of gunpowder and tons of cartridges|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0012.mp3|with the by no means impossible contingency of their prematurely igniting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0013.mp3|and giving us no time to say our prayers before launching us into eternity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0014.mp3|great care was enjoined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0015.mp3|and at eight o'clock every evening captain s|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0016.mp3|would come down and order all lights out for the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0017.mp3|but i used to put my lantern into a deep basin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0018.mp3|behind some boxes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0019.mp3|and so evaded the regulation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0020.mp3|i felt rather ashamed of this breach of discipline one night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0021.mp3|when another ammunition ship caught fire in the crowded harbour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0022.mp3|and threatened us all with speedy destruction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0024.mp3|if they failed in extinguishing the fire pretty quickly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0025.mp3|what our chances of life were worth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0026.mp3|and i think the bravest drew his breath heavily at the thought of our danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0029.mp3|but i do not think the crew of the medora slept very comfortably that night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0030.mp3|it was said that the russians had employed an incendiary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0031.mp3|but it would have been strange if in that densely crowded harbour some accidents had not happened without their agency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0034.mp3|was the getting our stores on shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0035.mp3|with the aid of the greek and maltese boatmen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0036.mp3|whose profession is thievery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0037.mp3|not only did they demand exorbitant sums for the carriage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0038.mp3|but they contrived to rob us by the way in the most ingenious manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0040.mp3|which had made the long voyage from england safely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0043.mp3|or passing by of one of the boatmen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0044.mp3|of course accidentally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0045.mp3|and no words could induce the rascals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0046.mp3|in their feigned ignorance of my language|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0047.mp3|to stop|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0048.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0050.mp3|it was not altogether consolatory to see another boat dart from between some shipping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0051.mp3|where it had been waiting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0052.mp3|as accidentally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0053.mp3|ready to pounce upon any such wind or waterfalls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0054.mp3|still more harassing work was it to keep the things together on the shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0055.mp3|often in the open light of day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0056.mp3|while i sat there after my duties on the sick wharf were over selling stores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0060.mp3|valuable things would be abstracted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0061.mp3|while there was no limit to the depredations by night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0062.mp3|of course we hired men to watch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0063.mp3|but our choice of servants was very limited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0064.mp3|and very often those we employed not only shut their eyes to the plunder of their companions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0065.mp3|but helped themselves freely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0066.mp3|the adage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0070.mp3|one night he caught a great limbed turk making off with a firkin of butter and some other things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0071.mp3|the fellow broke away from johnny's grasp with the butter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0072.mp3|but the lad marked him down to his wretched den|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0073.mp3|behind the engineers' quarters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0075.mp3|on the following morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0076.mp3|quietly introduced me to the lazy culprit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0078.mp3|there was a great row|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0079.mp3|and much indignation shown at the purpose of my visit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0082.mp3|in the presence of this most invaluable official|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0083.mp3|a confession was soon made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0084.mp3|beneath the fellow's dirty bed the butter was found buried|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0086.mp3|in its company|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0087.mp3|a two dozen case of sherry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0088.mp3|which the rogue had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0089.mp3|in flagrant defiance of the prophet's injunction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0090.mp3|stolen for his own private drinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0091.mp3|a few nights previously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0092.mp3|the thievery in this little out of the way port was something marvellous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0096.mp3|they robbed us the turks and one another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0097.mp3|but a stronger hand was sometimes laid on them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0100.mp3|was sure to be the victim|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0101.mp3|let who might be the oppressor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0102.mp3|in this predatory warfare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0103.mp3|as in more honourable service|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0105.mp3|these undoubtedly gallant little fellows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0109.mp3|when the luxury of a brash with the russians was occasionally denied them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0111.mp3|in search of opportunities of waging war against society at large|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0112.mp3|their complete and utter absence of conscientious scruples as to the rights of property was most amusing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0114.mp3|or trip up a greek street merchant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0116.mp3|and scud away with the spoil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0117.mp3|cleverly stowed in his roomy red pantaloons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0118.mp3|was an operation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0119.mp3|for its coolness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0121.mp3|and perfectness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0122.mp3|well worth seeing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0124.mp3|to a great extent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0128.mp3|one half of the regiments would have been always engaged punishing the other half|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0129.mp3|the poor turk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0130.mp3|it is lamentable to think how he was robbed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0132.mp3|and bullied by his friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0134.mp3|there wasn't a rough sailor or shrewd boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0135.mp3|the english boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0136.mp3|in all his impudence and prejudice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0138.mp3|who would not gladly have patted him upon the back if he would but have held up his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0139.mp3|and shown ever so little spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0140.mp3|but the englishman cannot understand a coward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0141.mp3|will scarcely take the trouble to pity him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0144.mp3|so they told me on the spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0146.mp3|in those old times of which i know so little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0147.mp3|very often an injured turk would run up to where i sat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0148.mp3|and stand there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0149.mp3|wildly telegraphing his complaints against some villainous looking greek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0150.mp3|or italian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0151.mp3|whom a stout english lad would have shaken out of his dirty skin in five minutes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0152.mp3|once however i saw the tables turned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0154.mp3|i will narrate it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0155.mp3|hearing one morning a louder hubbub than was usual upon the completion of a bargain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0156.mp3|and the inevitable quarrelling that always followed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0157.mp3|i went up to where i saw an excited crowd collected around a turk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0158.mp3|in whose hands a greek was struggling vainly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0160.mp3|it seemed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0161.mp3|robbed his enemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0162.mp3|but the turk was master this time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0163.mp3|and had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0164.mp3|in order to force from the robber a confession of the place where the stolen things were deposited like dogs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0165.mp3|as they were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0166.mp3|these fellows were fond of burying their plunder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0167.mp3|resorted to torture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0172.mp3|until the pain elicited a confession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0173.mp3|but the turk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0174.mp3|stimulated to retaliation by his triumph|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0175.mp3|bagged the greek's basket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0176.mp3|which contained amongst other things two watches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0177.mp3|which their present owner had no doubt stolen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0178.mp3|driven to the most ludicrous show of despair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0179.mp3|the greek was about to attempt another desperate struggle for the recovery of his goods|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0181.mp3|and were eagerly referred to by all the parties concerned in the squabble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0182.mp3|how they contrived it i cannot say so prompt were their movements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0185.mp3|the watches were in their possession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0187.mp3|who both combined to arrest this new movement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0188.mp3|and thereby added a sharp thrashing to their other injuries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0190.mp3|while the greek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0191.mp3|with a despair that had in it an equal share of the ludicrous and the tragic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0192.mp3|threw himself upon the dusty ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0193.mp3|and tore his thin hair out by handfuls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0195.mp3|whom we could not help pitying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0197.mp3|to discover his oppressors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0198.mp3|but i fear he didn't gain much information there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0199.mp3|had it not been for the unremitting activity of the authorities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0201.mp3|with its population of villains of every nation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0203.mp3|murder was sometimes added to robbery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0204.mp3|and many of the rascals themselves died suspicious deaths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0205.mp3|with the particulars of which the authorities did not trouble themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0206.mp3|but the officials worked hard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0207.mp3|both in the harbour and on shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0208.mp3|to keep order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0209.mp3|few men could have worked harder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0211.mp3|and those of his subordinates must have been somewhat heavy sleepers who could play the sluggard then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0212.mp3|at length the necessary preparations to establish our store were made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0215.mp3|close to where the railway engines were stationed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0217.mp3|leave having been obtained to erect buildings here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0218.mp3|we set to work briskly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0219.mp3|and soon altered the appearance of spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0220.mp3|so we christened our new home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0221.mp3|sometimes on horseback|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0222.mp3|sometimes getting a lift on the commissariat carts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0224.mp3|i managed to visit spring hill daily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0225.mp3|and very soon fitted up a shed sufficiently large to take up my abode in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0226.mp3|but the difficulty of building our store was immense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0227.mp3|to obtain material was next to impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0228.mp3|but that collected not a little was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0229.mp3|by leave of the admiral|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0230.mp3|gleaned from the floating rubbish in the harbour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0231.mp3|to find workmen to make use of it was still more difficult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0232.mp3|i spent days going round the shipping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0233.mp3|offering great wages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0236.mp3|however roughly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0237.mp3|and many a long ride through the camps did i take on the same errand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0238.mp3|at length|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0239.mp3|by dint of hard canvassing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0240.mp3|we obtained the aid of two english sailors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0241.mp3|whom i nicknamed big and little chips and some turks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0242.mp3|and set to work in good earnest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0244.mp3|it was decided that we should apply to him for help|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0249.mp3|and after taking coffee i proceeded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0251.mp3|to explain the object of my visit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0252.mp3|while his excellency|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0254.mp3|with a dark pleasing face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0255.mp3|smoked gravely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0256.mp3|and took my request into his gracious consideration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0257.mp3|on the following day came the answer to my request|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0259.mp3|who were placed at our orders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0262.mp3|a turkish officer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0264.mp3|took so great an interest in our labours that he would work like any carpenter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0265.mp3|and with a delight and zeal that were astonishing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0266.mp3|to see him fall back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0268.mp3|was a sight to restore the most severely tried temper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0270.mp3|and never wearied of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0271.mp3|but for him i do not know how we should have managed with our other turkish chips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0272.mp3|chips of the true old turkish block they were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0276.mp3|breaking off into endless interruptions for the sacred duties of eating and praying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0277.mp3|and getting into out of the way corners at all times of the day to smoke themselves to sleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0278.mp3|in the midst of our work a calamity occurred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0279.mp3|which was very nearly becoming a catastrophe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0280.mp3|by the giving way of a dam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0281.mp3|after some heavy rains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0282.mp3|the little stream which threaded its silvery way past spring hill swelled without any warning into a torrent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0284.mp3|sweeping through my temporary hut|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0285.mp3|very nearly carried us all away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0286.mp3|and destroyed stores of between one and two hundred pounds in value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0287.mp3|this calamity might have had a tragical issue for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0289.mp3|valuable as relics of the past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0290.mp3|being carried away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0291.mp3|i plunged in after it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0292.mp3|and losing my balance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0293.mp3|was rolled over and over by the stream|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0294.mp3|and with some difficulty reached the shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0296.mp3|made inquiries respecting the loss we had sustained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0298.mp3|who made many purchases|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0299.mp3|in token of their sympathy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0301.mp3|he soon found his way to spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0302.mp3|and before long became one of my best customers and most frequent visitors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0303.mp3|it was astonishing to note how completely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0305.mp3|he adapted himself to the tastes and habits of the infidels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0307.mp3|on the continent for a holiday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0308.mp3|he threw aside all the prejudices of his education|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0309.mp3|and drank bottled beer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0314.mp3|chatting with us or the english officers who would lounge into our as yet unfinished store|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0315.mp3|sometimes he would come down to breakfast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0316.mp3|and spend the greater part of the day at spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0318.mp3|the wits of spring hill used to laugh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0321.mp3|but as the honest fellow candidly confessed he had three wives already at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0322.mp3|i acquit him of any desire to add to their number|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0324.mp3|and at last nothing would do but he must take lessons of me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0325.mp3|so he would come down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0326.mp3|and sitting in my store|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0327.mp3|with a turk or so at his feet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0328.mp3|to attend to his most important pipe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0329.mp3|by inserting little red hot pieces of charcoal at intervals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0331.mp3|he never got beyond half a dozen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0332.mp3|and i think if we had continued in the relation of pupil and mistress until now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_11_seacole_0333.mp3|the number would not have been increased greatly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0005.mp3|it still wanted shutters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0006.mp3|but long before that time spring hill had gained a great reputation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0007.mp3|of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0008.mp3|i have nothing to do with what occurred in the camp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0009.mp3|although i could not help hearing a great deal about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0010.mp3|mismanagement and privation there might have been|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0011.mp3|but my business was to make things right in my sphere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0013.mp3|and disorder existed elsewhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0014.mp3|comfort and order were always to be found at spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0015.mp3|when there was no sun elsewhere some few gleams|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0016.mp3|so its grateful visitors said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0017.mp3|always seemed to have stayed behind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0018.mp3|to cheer the weary soldiers that gathered in the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0020.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0021.mp3|as my kind friend punch said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0022.mp3|after all these things had become pleasant memories of the past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0023.mp3|the cold without gave a zest no doubt to the welcome warmth within|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0024.mp3|but her smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0025.mp3|good old soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0026.mp3|lent heat to the coal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0028.mp3|let me in a few words describe the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0029.mp3|it was acknowledged by all to be the most complete thing there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0030.mp3|it cost no less than eight hundred pounds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0031.mp3|the buildings and yards took up at least an acre of ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0033.mp3|the hotel and storehouse consisted of a long iron room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0034.mp3|with counters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0037.mp3|above it was another low room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0038.mp3|used by us for storing our goods|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0039.mp3|and above this floated a large union jack|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0040.mp3|attached to this building was a little kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0041.mp3|not unlike a ship's caboose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0042.mp3|all stoves and shelves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0043.mp3|in addition to the iron house were two wooden houses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0044.mp3|with sleeping apartments for myself and mister day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0046.mp3|a canteen for the soldiery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0047.mp3|and a large enclosed yard for our stock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0048.mp3|full of stables|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0051.mp3|everything although rough and unpolished was comfortable and warm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0052.mp3|and there was a completeness about the whole which won general admiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0053.mp3|the reader may judge of the manner in which we had stocked the interior of our store from the remark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0054.mp3|often repeated by the officers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0056.mp3|from an anchor down to a needle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0058.mp3|we had for our transport service four carts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0059.mp3|and as many horses and mules as could be kept from the thieves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0061.mp3|at any future time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0062.mp3|was impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0064.mp3|and on the following morning been compelled to borrow cattle from the land transport camp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0066.mp3|but it must not be supposed that my domestic difficulties came to an end with the completion of the hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0068.mp3|i was in a better position to bear the crimean cold and rain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0071.mp3|biped and quadruped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0072.mp3|human and animal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0073.mp3|troubled me more than ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0074.mp3|and perhaps the most difficult to deal with were the least dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0075.mp3|the crimean rats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0076.mp3|for instance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0077.mp3|who had the appetites of london aldermen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0078.mp3|and were as little dainty as hungry schoolboys|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0079.mp3|whether they had left sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0080.mp3|guided by the instinct which leads their kindred in other parts of the world to forsake sinking ships|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0081.mp3|or because the garrison rations offended their palates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0082.mp3|or whether they had patriotically emigrated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0083.mp3|to make war against the english larders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0084.mp3|i do not pretend to guess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0086.mp3|whatever was their motive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0087.mp3|it drew them in great abundance to spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0089.mp3|in a single night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0090.mp3|to the tune of two or three pounds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0091.mp3|wasting what they could not devour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0092.mp3|you could keep nothing sacred from their strong teeth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0093.mp3|when hard pressed they more than once attacked the live sheep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0094.mp3|and at last they went so far as to nibble one of our black cooks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0097.mp3|on the following morning he came to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0100.mp3|to show me a mangled finger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0101.mp3|which they had bitten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0102.mp3|and ask me to dress it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0103.mp3|he made a great fuss|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0104.mp3|and a few mornings later he came in a violent passion this time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0105.mp3|and gave me instant notice to quit my service|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0106.mp3|although we were paying him two pounds a week|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0107.mp3|with board and rations|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0108.mp3|this time the rats had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0111.mp3|and attacked his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0112.mp3|in a spot where its natural armour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0115.mp3|and the silly fellow had a notion that the souls of the slain russian soldiers had entered the bodies of the rats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0116.mp3|and made vengeful war upon their late enemies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0117.mp3|driven to such an extremity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0118.mp3|i made up my mind to scour the camp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0119.mp3|in search of a cat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0121.mp3|after a long day's hunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0122.mp3|i came to the conclusion that the tale of whittington was by no means an improbable one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0124.mp3|had a brisk young fellow with a cat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0125.mp3|of even ordinary skill in its profession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0126.mp3|made their appearance at spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0127.mp3|i would gladly have put them in the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0128.mp3|of laying the foundation at least|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0129.mp3|of a fortune|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0132.mp3|who kindly promised me a great pet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0133.mp3|well known in the camp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0134.mp3|and perhaps by some who may read these pages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0135.mp3|by the name of pinkie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0137.mp3|but on the following day a guardsman brought the noble fellow down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0138.mp3|he lived in clover for a few days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0140.mp3|and despite the abundance of game|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0141.mp3|pinkie soon stole away to his old master's quarters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0142.mp3|three miles off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0143.mp3|more than once the men brought him back to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0144.mp3|but the attractions of spring hill were never strong enough to detain him long with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0145.mp3|from the human thieves that surrounded spring hill i had to stand as sharp a siege as the russians had in that poor city against which we heard the guns thundering daily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0146.mp3|while the most cunning and desperate sorties were often made upon the most exposed parts of my defences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0147.mp3|and sometimes with success|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0148.mp3|scores of the keenest eyes and hundreds of the sharpest fingers in the world were always ready to take advantage of the least oversight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0149.mp3|i had to keep two boys|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0151.mp3|tied up to the doorposts of the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0152.mp3|before i adopted this safeguard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0153.mp3|more than one officer would leave his horse for a few minutes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0154.mp3|and on his return find it gone to the neighbourhood of the naval brigade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0158.mp3|soon found me out at spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0159.mp3|and the wiry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0161.mp3|fighting loving gentry spent much of their leisure there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0163.mp3|nothing was too small and few things too unwieldy to ride in them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0164.mp3|like the pockets of clown in a pantomime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0165.mp3|they could accommodate a well grown baby or a pound of sausages equally well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0166.mp3|i have a firm conviction that they stuffed turkeys|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0168.mp3|and fowls into them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0169.mp3|and i positively know that my only respectable teapot travelled off in the same conveyance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0170.mp3|while i detected one little fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0171.mp3|who had tied them down tight at his ankles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0172.mp3|stowing away some pounds of tea and coffee mixed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0175.mp3|cut the cords|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0176.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0177.mp3|holding up the little scamp by the neck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0180.mp3|from the horses and mules down to the geese and fowls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0181.mp3|suffered terribly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0182.mp3|although we kept a sharp look out by day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0183.mp3|and paid a man five shillings a night as watchman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0184.mp3|our losses were very great|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0185.mp3|during the time we were in the crimea we lost over a score of horses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0186.mp3|four mules|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0187.mp3|eighty goats|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0191.mp3|by thieving alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0192.mp3|we missed in a single night forty goats and seven sheep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0194.mp3|they told him that lord raglan had recently received forty sheep from asia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0195.mp3|all of which had disappeared in the same manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0196.mp3|the geese turkeys and fowls vanished by scores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0197.mp3|we found out afterwards that the watchman paid to guard the sheep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0198.mp3|used to kill a few occasionally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0199.mp3|as he represented them to have died a natural death during the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0200.mp3|he got permission to bury them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0201.mp3|instead of which he sold them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0202.mp3|king frost claimed his share of our stock too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0203.mp3|and on one december night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0204.mp3|of the winter of eighteen fifty five|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0205.mp3|killed no less than forty sheep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0206.mp3|it is all very well to smile at these things now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0208.mp3|and helped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0209.mp3|if they did not cause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0212.mp3|which was quietly and unconsciously fattening in its sty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0213.mp3|are worthy of record|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0215.mp3|in the spring of eighteen fifty five|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0216.mp3|was certainly one of those luxuries not easily obtainable in that part of the crimea to which the british army was confined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0218.mp3|and that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0219.mp3|brave woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0220.mp3|she had formed the courageous resolution of fattening it for her favourites|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0221.mp3|the excitement among the frequenters of spring hill was very great|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0222.mp3|i could laugh heartily now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0223.mp3|when i think of the amount of persuasion and courting i stood out for before i bound myself how its four legs were to be disposed of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0224.mp3|i learnt more at that time of the trials and privileges of authority than i am ever likely to experience again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0225.mp3|upon my word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0227.mp3|i should have found candidates for them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0229.mp3|the contest for those i had to bestow was very keen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0230.mp3|and the lucky individuals who were favoured by me looked after their interests most carefully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0231.mp3|one of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0232.mp3|to render mistake or misunderstanding impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0233.mp3|entered my promise in my day book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0234.mp3|the reader will perhaps smile at the following important memorandum in the gallant officer's writing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0237.mp3|and lieutenant w|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0240.mp3|now it was well known that many greedy eyes and fingers were directed towards the plump fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0241.mp3|and considerable interest was manifested in the result of the struggle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0244.mp3|i think they had some confidence in me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0245.mp3|and that i was the favourite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0246.mp3|but there was a large field against me which found its backers also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0247.mp3|and many a bet was laughingly laid on the ultimate fate of the unconscious porker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0248.mp3|i baffled many a knavish trick to gain possession of the fine fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0251.mp3|i lost him in the middle of the day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0252.mp3|when i thought the boldest rogues would not have run the risk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0253.mp3|the shouts and laughter of some officers who were riding down from the front first informed me of my loss|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0257.mp3|the pig's gone i rushed out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0258.mp3|injured woman that i was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0259.mp3|and saw it all at a glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0260.mp3|but that my straw wide awake was in the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0261.mp3|i could have torn my hair in my vexation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0262.mp3|i rushed to the sty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0263.mp3|found the nest warm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0264.mp3|and with prompt decision prepared for speedy pursuit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0266.mp3|they can't have got very far away yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0267.mp3|do your best to save my bacon delighted with the fun|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0268.mp3|the horsemen dispersed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0269.mp3|laughing and shouting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0273.mp3|and started in pursuit also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0274.mp3|not half a mile off we soon saw a horseman wave his cap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0275.mp3|and starting off into a run|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0276.mp3|came to a little hollow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0277.mp3|where the poor panting animal and two greek thieves had been run down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0279.mp3|and piggy was brought home in triumph|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0280.mp3|but those who had pork expectancies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0281.mp3|hearing of the adventure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0282.mp3|grew so seriously alarmed at the narrow escape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0283.mp3|that they petitioned me to run so desperate a hazard no longer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0284.mp3|and the poor thing was killed on the following day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0285.mp3|and distributed according to promise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0286.mp3|a certain portion was reserved for sausages|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0288.mp3|fried with mashed potatoes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0289.mp3|were quite the rage at the british hotel for some days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0291.mp3|with an account of the dangers we ran from thieves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0292.mp3|it drew the following kind acknowledgment from general b|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0296.mp3|i have spoken to colonel p|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0297.mp3|as to the police of your neighbourhood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0298.mp3|and he will see what arrangement can be made for the general protection of that line of road|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0299.mp3|when the high road is finished you will be better off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0300.mp3|let me know at the time of any depredations that are committed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0301.mp3|and we will try and protect you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0302.mp3|i am faithfully yours m l b|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0303.mp3|for the truth was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0304.mp3|although i can laugh at my fears now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0305.mp3|i was often most horribly frightened at spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0306.mp3|and there was cause for it too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0307.mp3|my washerwoman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0309.mp3|with her family|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0310.mp3|lived not half a mile from us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0312.mp3|and carried off some things for the wash|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0313.mp3|on the following morning i was horrified to learn that she|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0314.mp3|her father|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0317.mp3|in all seven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0318.mp3|had been most foully murdered during the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0320.mp3|and lived to tell the tale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0321.mp3|it created a great sensation at the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0322.mp3|and caused me to pass many a sleepless night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0323.mp3|for the murderers were never discovered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0325.mp3|i may as well exhaust it without paying any regard to the chronological order of my reminiscences|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0326.mp3|i have before mentioned what i suffered from the french|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0327.mp3|one day i caught one of our allies in my kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0328.mp3|robbing me in the most ungrateful manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0329.mp3|he had met with an accident near spring hill i believe he belonged to a french regiment lent to assist the english in road making|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0330.mp3|and had been doctored by me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0331.mp3|and now i found him filling his pockets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0332.mp3|before taking french leave of us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0335.mp3|pulled from his pockets a yet warm fowl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0336.mp3|and other provisions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0337.mp3|we kicked him off the premises|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0338.mp3|and he found refuge with some men of the army works corps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0339.mp3|who pitied him and gave him shelter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0340.mp3|he woke them in the middle of the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0342.mp3|and in the morning they brought him to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0343.mp3|to ask what they should do with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0344.mp3|unluckily for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0345.mp3|a french officer of rank happened to be in the store|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0347.mp3|on hearing our tale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0348.mp3|packed him off to his regiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0349.mp3|i gathered from the expression of the officer's face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0352.mp3|the trouble i underwent respecting a useful black mare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0353.mp3|for which mister day had given thirty guineas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0354.mp3|and which carried me beautifully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0356.mp3|before it had been many weeks in our store it was gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0357.mp3|whither i failed to discover|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0358.mp3|keeping my eyes wide open however i saw angelina|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0359.mp3|so i christened her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0360.mp3|coming quietly down the hill carrying an elderly naval officer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0361.mp3|i was ready to receive the unconscious couple|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0362.mp3|and soon made my claim good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0363.mp3|of course the officer was not to blame|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0365.mp3|who in his turn had purchased the animal of a messmate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0366.mp3|who of course had obtained it from another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0367.mp3|and so on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0368.mp3|but eventually it returned to its old quarters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0369.mp3|where it only remained about a fortnight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0370.mp3|i grew tired of looking for angelina|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0371.mp3|and had given her up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0372.mp3|when one day she turned up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0373.mp3|in capital condition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0375.mp3|but nothing i could say to the frenchman would induce him to take the view of the matter i wished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0376.mp3|but had no right to enforce|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0378.mp3|we grew hot at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0380.mp3|and tried to make off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0381.mp3|i held on to angelina for a little while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0382.mp3|but at last the mare broke away from me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0384.mp3|and vanished in a cloud of dust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0385.mp3|it was the last i ever saw of angelina|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0386.mp3|more than once the crimean thievery reduced us to woeful straits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0387.mp3|to a greek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0388.mp3|returning to constantinople|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0390.mp3|containing things for the wash which he was to bring back as soon as possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0391.mp3|but neither upon greek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0393.mp3|nor their contents did we ever set eyes again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0394.mp3|it was a serious loss|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0395.mp3|the best part of our table cloths and other domestic linen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0396.mp3|all my clothes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0397.mp3|except two suits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0398.mp3|and all of mister day's linen vanished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0400.mp3|perhaps the most ridiculous shift i was ever put to by the crimean thieves happened when we rose one morning and found the greater part of our stud missing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0402.mp3|in the course of the day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0404.mp3|the only animal available for my transport was an old grey mare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0405.mp3|who had contracted some equine disease of which i do not know the name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0406.mp3|but which gave her considerable resemblance to a dog suffering from the mange|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0407.mp3|now go to the french camp i must|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0408.mp3|to borrow a horse was impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0409.mp3|and something must be done with the grey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0410.mp3|suddenly one of those happy thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0411.mp3|which sometimes help us over our greatest difficulties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0412.mp3|entered into my scheming brains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0413.mp3|could i not conceal the poor mare's worst blemishes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0414.mp3|her colour was grey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0416.mp3|there was no time to be lost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0417.mp3|the remedy was administered successfully and off i started|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0418.mp3|but alas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0420.mp3|that before long its false coat was transferred to the dark cloth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0421.mp3|and my innocent ruse exposed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0422.mp3|the french are proverbially and really a polite and considerate nation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_12_seacole_0423.mp3|but i never heard more hearty peals of laughter from any sides than those which conveyed to me the horrible assurance that my scheme had unhappily failed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0002.mp3|that i enter upon the particulars of this chapter with great reluctance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0003.mp3|but i cannot omit them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0004.mp3|for the simple reason that they strengthen my one and only claim to interest the public|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0006.mp3|my services to the brave british army in the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0008.mp3|fortunately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0009.mp3|i can follow a course which will not only render it unnecessary for me to sound my own trumpet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0010.mp3|but will be more satisfactory to the reader|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0012.mp3|and before i do so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0015.mp3|and mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0016.mp3|i have never been long in any place before i have found my practical experience in the science of medicine useful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0017.mp3|even in london i have found it of service to others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0018.mp3|and in the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0019.mp3|where the doctors were so overworked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0020.mp3|and sickness was so prevalent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0021.mp3|i could not be long idle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0022.mp3|for i never forgot that my intention in seeking the army was to help the kind hearted doctors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0023.mp3|to be useful to whom i have ever looked upon and still regard as so high a privilege|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0024.mp3|but before very long i found myself surrounded with patients of my own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0025.mp3|and this for two simple reasons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0026.mp3|in the first place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0027.mp3|the men i am speaking of the ranks now had a very serious objection to going into hospital for any but urgent reasons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0028.mp3|and the regimental doctors were rather fond of sending them there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0031.mp3|they could and did get at my store sick comforts and nourishing food|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0032.mp3|which the heads of the medical staff would sometimes find it difficult to procure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0033.mp3|these reasons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0034.mp3|with the additional one that i was very familiar with the diseases which they suffered most from|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0035.mp3|and successful in their treatment i say this in no spirit of vanity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0036.mp3|were quite sufficient to account for the numbers who came daily to the british hotel for medical treatment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0037.mp3|that the officers were glad of me as a doctress and nurse may be easily understood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0038.mp3|when a poor fellow lay sickening in his cheerless hut and sent down to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0039.mp3|he knew very well that i should not ride up in answer to his message empty handed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0040.mp3|and although i did not hesitate to charge him with the value of the necessaries i took him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0041.mp3|still he was thankful enough to be able to purchase them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0042.mp3|when we lie ill at home surrounded with comfort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0043.mp3|we never think of feeling any special gratitude for the sick room delicacies which we accept as a consequence of our illness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0044.mp3|but the poor officer lying ill and weary in his crazy hut|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0045.mp3|dependent for the merest necessaries of existence upon a clumsy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0046.mp3|ignorant soldier cook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0047.mp3|who would almost prefer eating his meat raw to having the trouble of cooking it our english soldiers are bad campaigners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0048.mp3|often finds his greatest troubles in the want of those little delicacies with which a weak stomach must be humoured into retaining nourishment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0049.mp3|how often have i felt sad at the sight of poor lads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0052.mp3|or the natty little boots would not retain their polish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0053.mp3|bearing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0054.mp3|and bearing so nobly and bravely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0059.mp3|with parched lips and fading appetite|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0060.mp3|thousands of miles from mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0063.mp3|loathing the rough food by your side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0064.mp3|and thinking regretfully of that english home where nothing that could minister to your great need would be left untried|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0065.mp3|don't you think that you would welcome the familiar figure of the stout lady whose bony horse has just pulled up at the door of your hut|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0066.mp3|and whose panniers contain some cooling drink|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0067.mp3|a little broth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0068.mp3|some homely cake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0070.mp3|don't you think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0071.mp3|under such circumstances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0072.mp3|that you would heartily agree with my friend punch's remark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0073.mp3|that berry brown face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0074.mp3|with a kind heart's trace impressed on each wrinkle sly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0075.mp3|was a sight to behold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0076.mp3|through the snow clouds rolled across that iron sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0079.mp3|i have seen many a bold fellow's eyes moisten at such a season|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0080.mp3|when a woman's voice and a woman's care have brought to their minds recollections of those happy english homes which some of them never saw again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0081.mp3|but many did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0082.mp3|who will remember their woman comrade upon the bleak and barren heights before sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0083.mp3|then their calling me mother was not i think altogether unmeaning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0084.mp3|i used to fancy that there was something homely in the word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0087.mp3|you cannot think how dear to them was the smallest thing that reminded them of home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0089.mp3|who were glad of me as nurse and doctress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0090.mp3|bore names familiar to all england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0091.mp3|and perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0092.mp3|did i ask them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0093.mp3|they would allow me to publish those names|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0095.mp3|on whose brave breast the order of victoria rests|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0096.mp3|a more gallant man can never wear it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0097.mp3|sent for the doctress whom he had known in kingston|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0098.mp3|when his arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0099.mp3|wounded on the fatal eighteenth of june|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0100.mp3|refused to heal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0101.mp3|and i think that the application i recommended did it good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0103.mp3|taken from a large bundle|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0105.mp3|of course i must suppress most of their names|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0107.mp3|my dear mamma|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0108.mp3|will you kindly give the bearer the bottle you promised me when you were here this morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0110.mp3|please let me know how much i am to take of it|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0116.mp3|i have finished the bottle which has done my jaundice a deal of good|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0119.mp3|f m it was a capital prescription which had done his jaundice good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0120.mp3|there was so great a demand for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0121.mp3|that i kept it mixed in a large pan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0122.mp3|ready to ladle it out to the scores of applicants who came for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0123.mp3|sometimes they would send for other and no less important medicines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0127.mp3|by giving his servant the bearer a boiled or roast fowl|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0170.mp3|and their hospital was nearly opposite to the british hotel|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0183.mp3|which they had no means of obtaining except in the hospital|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0184.mp3|and most of that class had an objection to go into hospital|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0302.mp3|i think i was ever ready to turn from the latter to help the former|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0304.mp3|and they were grateful in their way and as far as they could be|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0312.mp3|and never a train of sick or wounded men from the front passed the british hotel but its hostess was awaiting them to offer comforts to the poor fellows|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0323.mp3|for k c b or plain private smith|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0324.mp3|she had still one pleasant face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0326.mp3|and paid their honest shot|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0331.mp3|was as much as she chose that dreary winter tide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0332.mp3|when death hung o'er the damp and pestilent camp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0333.mp3|and his scythe swung far and wide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0334.mp3|she gave her aid to all who prayed to hungry and sick and cold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0335.mp3|open hand and heart alike ready to part kind words and acts and gold|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0337.mp3|be the right man in the right place who can|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0340.mp3|now that we have come to the end of this chapter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0341.mp3|i can say what i have been all anxiety to tell you from its beginning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0342.mp3|please look back to chapter eight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_13_seacole_0343.mp3|and see how hard the right woman had to struggle to convey herself to the right place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0001.mp3|who came there for its creature comforts as well as its hostess's medicines when need was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0002.mp3|and if he or she should be inclined to doubt or should hesitate at accepting my experience of crimean life as entirely credible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0003.mp3|i beg that individual to refer to the accounts which were given in the newspapers of the spring of eighteen fifty five|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0004.mp3|and i feel sure they will acquit me of any intention to exaggerate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0005.mp3|if i were to speak of all the nameless horrors of that spring as plainly as i could|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0006.mp3|i should really disgust you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0007.mp3|but those i shall bring before your notice have all something of the humorous in them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0008.mp3|and so it ever is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0009.mp3|time is a great restorer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0010.mp3|and changes surely the greatest sorrow into a pleasing memory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0013.mp3|and cover the sod that presses on many a mouldering token of the old time of battle and death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0015.mp3|if i went to the crimea now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0016.mp3|i should see a smiling landscape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0017.mp3|instead of the blood stained scene which i shall ever associate with distress and death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0018.mp3|and as it is with nature so it is with human kind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0019.mp3|whenever i meet those who have survived that dreary spring of eighteen fifty five|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0020.mp3|we seldom talk about its horrors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0021.mp3|but remembering its transient gleams of sunshine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0022.mp3|smile at the fun and good nature that varied its long and weary monotony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0024.mp3|my memory prefers to dwell upon what was pleasing and amusing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0025.mp3|although the time will never come when it will cease to retain most vividly the pathos and woe of those dreadful months|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0026.mp3|i have said that the winter had not ended when we began operations at the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0027.mp3|and very often|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0028.mp3|after we considered we were fairly under spring's influence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0029.mp3|our old enemy would come back with an angry roar of wind and rain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0031.mp3|unroofing huts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0032.mp3|destroying roads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0033.mp3|and handing over may to the command of general fevrier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0034.mp3|but the sun fought bravely for us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0035.mp3|and in time always dispersed the leaden clouds and gilded the iron sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0036.mp3|and made us cheerful again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0037.mp3|during the end of march|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0038.mp3|the whole of april|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0039.mp3|and a considerable portion of may|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0041.mp3|the army was but a little better off for the advent of spring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0042.mp3|the military road to the camp was only in progress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0043.mp3|the railway only carried ammunition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0045.mp3|and scarcity often existed in the front before sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0047.mp3|so that very often to the british hotel came officers starved out on the heights above us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0048.mp3|the dandies of rotten row would come down riding on sorry nags|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0049.mp3|ready to carry back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0050.mp3|their servants were on duty in the trenches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0051.mp3|anything that would be available for dinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0052.mp3|a single glance at their personal appearance would suffice to show the hardships of the life they were called upon to lead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0053.mp3|before i left london for the seat of war i had been more than once to the united service club|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0054.mp3|seeking to gain the interest of officers whom i had known in jamaica|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0055.mp3|and i often thought afterwards of the difference between those i saw there trimly shaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0056.mp3|handsomely dressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0057.mp3|with spotless linen and dandy air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0058.mp3|and these their companions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0059.mp3|who in england would resemble them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0061.mp3|warmly dressed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0062.mp3|with great fur caps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0063.mp3|which met their beards and left nothing exposed but lips and nose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0064.mp3|and not much of those|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0065.mp3|you would easily believe that soap and water were luxuries not readily obtainable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0067.mp3|and that they were familiar with horrors you would shudder to hear named|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0070.mp3|can you fancy what the want of so simple a thing as a pocket handkerchief is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0071.mp3|to put a case have you ever gone out for the day without one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0072.mp3|sat in a draught and caught a sneezing cold in the head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0073.mp3|you say the question is an unnecessarily unpleasant one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0074.mp3|and yet what i am about to tell you is true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0078.mp3|an officer had ridden down one day to obtain refreshments this was very early in the spring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0079.mp3|some nice fowls had just been taken from the spit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0080.mp3|and i offered one to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0081.mp3|paper was one of the most hardly obtainable luxuries of the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0082.mp3|and i rarely had any to waste upon my customers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0083.mp3|so i called out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0086.mp3|that i may wrap it up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0087.mp3|you see we could not be very particular out there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0088.mp3|but he smiled very bitterly as he answered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0089.mp3|pocket handkerchief|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0092.mp3|i wish i had one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0093.mp3|i tore my last shirt into shreds a fortnight ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0094.mp3|and there's not a bit of it left now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0095.mp3|shortly after|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0096.mp3|a hundred dozen of these useful articles came to my store|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0097.mp3|and i sold them all to officers and men very speedily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0098.mp3|for some time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0099.mp3|and until i found the task beyond my strength|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0100.mp3|i kept up a capital table at the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0101.mp3|but at last i gave up doing so professedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0102.mp3|and my hungry customers had to make shift with whatever was on the premises|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0103.mp3|fortunately they were not over dainty and had few antipathies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0104.mp3|my duties increased so rapidly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0105.mp3|that sometimes it was with difficulty that i found time to eat and sleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0106.mp3|could i have obtained good servants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0107.mp3|my daily labours would have been lightened greatly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0108.mp3|but my staff never consisted of more than a few boys|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0109.mp3|two black cooks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0112.mp3|osman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0113.mp3|had enough to do to kill and pluck the poultry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0114.mp3|while the others looked after the stock and killed our goats and sheep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0116.mp3|but they never found my larder entirely empty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0117.mp3|i often used to roast a score or so of fowls daily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0118.mp3|besides boiling hams and tongues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0119.mp3|either these or a slice from a joint of beef or mutton you would be pretty sure of finding at your service in the larder of the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0121.mp3|gentle reader|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0122.mp3|to know what other things suggestive of home and its comforts your relatives and friends in the crimea could obtain from the hostess of spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0123.mp3|i do not tell you that the following articles were all obtainable at the commencement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0124.mp3|but many were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0125.mp3|the time was indeed when|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0126.mp3|had you asked me for mock turtle and venison|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0127.mp3|you should have had them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0128.mp3|preserved in tins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0129.mp3|but that was when the crimea was flooded with plenty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0130.mp3|too late alas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0131.mp3|to save many whom want had killed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0136.mp3|boots and shoes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0137.mp3|for the outer man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0138.mp3|and for the inner man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0144.mp3|which last beaten up into fritters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0150.mp3|were very good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0151.mp3|game|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0152.mp3|wild fowl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0154.mp3|also preserved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0157.mp3|curry powder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0161.mp3|cigarette papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0163.mp3|coffee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0165.mp3|and currant jelly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0166.mp3|when cargoes came in from constantinople|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0167.mp3|we bought great supplies of potatoes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0172.mp3|what a rush there used to be for the greens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0173.mp3|you might sometimes get hot rolls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0181.mp3|unlike the french|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0182.mp3|could turn his hand to few things but fighting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0186.mp3|not of the fattest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0188.mp3|for in such miserable condition were the poor beasts landed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0190.mp3|when there came an urgent order from head quarters for twenty five pounds of mutton|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0191.mp3|we had to cut up one sheep and a half to provide the quantity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0192.mp3|or you would have stumbled upon something curried|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0193.mp3|or upon a good irish stew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0194.mp3|nice and hot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0195.mp3|with plenty of onions and potatoes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0196.mp3|or upon some capital meat pies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0197.mp3|i found the preserved meats were better relished cooked in this fashion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0198.mp3|and well doctored with stimulants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0199.mp3|before long i grew as familiar with the mysteries of seasoning as any london pieman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0200.mp3|and could accommodate myself to the requirements of the seasons as readily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0201.mp3|or had there been nothing better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0203.mp3|for the manufacture of which i became so famous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0204.mp3|and had you been fortunate enough to have visited the british hotel upon rice pudding day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0206.mp3|if i had nothing else to be proud of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0207.mp3|i think my rice puddings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0208.mp3|made without milk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0210.mp3|would have gained me a reputation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0212.mp3|hot and flurried|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0213.mp3|and called out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0216.mp3|some of them were baked in large shallow pans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0218.mp3|who always said that it reminded them of home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0219.mp3|you would scarcely expect to finish up your dinner with pastry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0220.mp3|but very often you would have found a good stock of it in my larder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0221.mp3|whenever i had a few leisure moments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0222.mp3|i used to wash my hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0223.mp3|roll up my sleeves and roll out pastry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0224.mp3|very often i was interrupted to dispense medicines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0225.mp3|but if the tarts had a flavour of senna|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0227.mp3|it never interfered with their consumption|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0228.mp3|i declare i never heard or read of an army so partial to pastry as that british army before sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0229.mp3|while i had a reputation for my sponge cakes that any pastry cook in london|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0231.mp3|might have been proud of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0232.mp3|the officers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0233.mp3|full of fun and high spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0234.mp3|used to crowd into the little kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0235.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0236.mp3|despite all my remonstrances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0237.mp3|which were not always confined to words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0238.mp3|for they made me frantic sometimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0239.mp3|and an iron spoon is a tempting weapon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0240.mp3|would carry off the tarts hot from the oven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0241.mp3|while the good for nothing black cooks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0242.mp3|instead of lending me their aid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0243.mp3|would stand by and laugh with all their teeth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0244.mp3|and when the hot season commenced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0245.mp3|the crowds that came to the british hotel for my claret and cider cups|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0246.mp3|and other cooling summer drinks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0247.mp3|were very complimentary in their expressions of appreciation of my skill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0249.mp3|supposing that you had made a hearty dinner and were thinking of starting homeward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0250.mp3|if i can use so pleasant a term in reference to your cheerless quarters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0251.mp3|it was very natural that you should be anxious to carry back something to your hut|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0252.mp3|perhaps you expected to be sent into the trenches many a supper cooked by me has been consumed in those fearful trenches by brave men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0253.mp3|who could eat it with keen appetites while the messengers of death were speeding around them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0254.mp3|or perhaps you had planned a little dinner party|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0255.mp3|and wanted to give your friends something better than their ordinary fare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0256.mp3|anyhow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0257.mp3|you would in all probability have some good reason for returning laden with comforts and necessaries from spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0258.mp3|you would not be very particular about carrying them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0259.mp3|you might have been a great swell at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0260.mp3|where you would have shuddered if bond street had seen you carrying a parcel no larger than your card case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0261.mp3|but those considerations rarely troubled you here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0263.mp3|your servant was lying crouched in a rifle pit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0264.mp3|having pots at the russians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0265.mp3|or keeping watch and ward in the long lines of trenches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0267.mp3|stripped to his shirt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0269.mp3|whose steady roar broke the evening's calm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0270.mp3|so if you did not wait upon yourself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0271.mp3|you would stand a very fair chance of being starved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0272.mp3|but you would open your knapsack|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0273.mp3|if you had brought one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0274.mp3|for me to fill it with potatoes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0276.mp3|never mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0280.mp3|many a mishap ludicrous but for their consequences happened on it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0281.mp3|i remember a young officer coming down one day just in time to carry off my last fowl and meat pie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0282.mp3|before he had gone far|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0285.mp3|the fowl flew in another|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0286.mp3|to make matters worse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0288.mp3|in his efforts to extricate himself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0289.mp3|did for them entirely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0290.mp3|and in terrible distress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0291.mp3|the poor fellow came back for me to set him up again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0292.mp3|i shook my head for a long time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0293.mp3|but at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0294.mp3|after he had over and over again urged upon me pathetically that he had two fellows coming to dine with him at six|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0295.mp3|and nothing in the world in his hut but salt pork|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0296.mp3|i resigned a plump fowl which i had kept back for my own dinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0297.mp3|off he started again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0298.mp3|but soon came back with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0301.mp3|i forgot all about the potatoes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0303.mp3|you must fill my bag again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0304.mp3|we all laughed heartily at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_14_seacole_0305.mp3|but this state of things had been rather tragical|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0001.mp3|i have attempted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0002.mp3|without any consideration of dates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0003.mp3|to give my readers some idea of my life in the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0004.mp3|i am fully aware that i have jumbled up events strangely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0005.mp3|talking in the same page|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0006.mp3|and even sentence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0007.mp3|of events which occurred at different times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0008.mp3|but i have three excuses to offer for my unhistorical inexactness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0009.mp3|in the first place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0010.mp3|my memory is far from trustworthy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0011.mp3|and i kept no written diary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0012.mp3|in the second place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0013.mp3|the reader must have had more than enough of journals and chronicles of crimean life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0015.mp3|and in the third place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0016.mp3|unless i am allowed to tell the story of my life in my own way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0017.mp3|i cannot tell it at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0018.mp3|i shall now endeavour to describe my out of door life as much as possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0020.mp3|but i shall continue to speak from my own experience simply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0021.mp3|and if the reader should be surprised at my leaving any memorable action of the army unnoticed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0022.mp3|he may be sure that it is because i was mixing medicines or making good things in the kitchen of the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0023.mp3|and first heard the particulars of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0024.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0025.mp3|from the newspapers which came from home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0028.mp3|that they were much more familiar with the history of the camp at their own firesides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0029.mp3|than we who lived in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0030.mp3|just as a spectator seeing one of the battles from a hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0032.mp3|knows more about it than the combatant in the valley below|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0033.mp3|who only thinks of the enemy whom it is his immediate duty to repel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0035.mp3|through the valuable aid of the cleverest man in the whole camp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0038.mp3|the actors in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0039.mp3|had enough to do to discharge our own duties well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0040.mp3|and rarely concerned ourselves in what seemed of such importance to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0042.mp3|the news of which created so much sensation in england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0043.mp3|was but little regarded at spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0044.mp3|my first experience of battle was pleasant enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0045.mp3|before we had been long at spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0046.mp3|omar pasha got something for his turks to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0048.mp3|i accompanied them on horseback and enjoyed the sight amazingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0049.mp3|english and french cavalry preceded the turkish infantry over the plain yet full of memorials of the terrible light cavalry charge a few months before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0051.mp3|another pushed their way up the hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0053.mp3|driving in the russian outposts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0054.mp3|after what seemed but a slight resistance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0055.mp3|it was very pretty to see them advance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0056.mp3|and to watch how every now and then little clouds of white smoke puffed up from behind bushes and the crests of hills|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0058.mp3|this was my first experience of actual battle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0059.mp3|and i felt that strange excitement which i do not remember on future occasions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0060.mp3|coupled with an earnest longing to see more of warfare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0061.mp3|and to share in its hazards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0062.mp3|it was not long before my wish was gratified|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0063.mp3|i do not know much of the second bombardment of sebastopol in the month of april|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0064.mp3|although i was as assiduous as i could be in my attendance at cathcart's hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0065.mp3|i could judge of its severity by the long trains of wounded which passed the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0066.mp3|i had a stretcher laid near the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0067.mp3|and very often a poor fellow was laid upon it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0069.mp3|after this unsuccessful bombardment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0070.mp3|it seemed to us that there was a sudden lull in the progress of the siege|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0071.mp3|and other things began to interest us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0072.mp3|there were several arrivals to talk over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0078.mp3|came the duke of newcastle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0079.mp3|and the great high priest of the mysteries of cookery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0081.mp3|alexis soyer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0082.mp3|he was often at spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0083.mp3|with the most smiling of faces and in the most gorgeous of irregular uniforms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0084.mp3|and never failed to praise my soups and dainties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0086.mp3|and with our west indian dishes could of course beat him hollow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0087.mp3|and more than once i challenged him to a trial of skill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0088.mp3|but the gallant frenchman only shrugged his shoulders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0089.mp3|and disclaimed my challenge with many flourishes of his jewelled hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0091.mp3|and be more disastrous than defeat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0092.mp3|and all because i was a woman forsooth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0093.mp3|what nonsense to talk like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0094.mp3|when i was doing the work of half a dozen men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0095.mp3|then he would laugh and declare that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0096.mp3|when our campaigns were over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0097.mp3|we would render rivalry impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0098.mp3|by combining to open the first restaurant in europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0099.mp3|there was always fun in the store when the good natured frenchman was there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0101.mp3|tempestuous night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0102.mp3|i was knocked up by the arrival of other visitors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0103.mp3|these were the first regiment of sardinian grenadiers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0105.mp3|benighted on their way to the position assigned them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0106.mp3|remained at spring hill until the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0107.mp3|we soon turned out our staff|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0108.mp3|and lighted up the store|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0109.mp3|and entertained the officers as well as we could inside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0111.mp3|not a single thing was stolen or disturbed that night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0112.mp3|although they had many opportunities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0113.mp3|we all admired and liked the sardinians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0115.mp3|well disciplined fellows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0116.mp3|and i wish there had been no worse men or soldiers in the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0117.mp3|as the season advanced many visitors came to the crimea from all parts of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0119.mp3|we should have been better off if some of them had spared us this compliment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0121.mp3|who could doubt any one with such a name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0122.mp3|stayed some time with us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0123.mp3|had the best of everything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0124.mp3|and paid us most honourably with one bill upon his agents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0125.mp3|while we cashed another to provide him with money for his homeward route|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0126.mp3|he was an accomplished fellow and i really liked him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0127.mp3|but unfortunately for us he was a swindler|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0128.mp3|i saw much of another visitor to the camp in the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0129.mp3|an old acquaintance of mine with whom i had had many a hard bout in past times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0130.mp3|the cholera|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0132.mp3|and i prescribed for many others personally|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0134.mp3|and although the authorities forbade the sutlers to sell it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0135.mp3|under heavy penalties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0136.mp3|it found its way into the camp in large quantities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0137.mp3|during may|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0139.mp3|summer broke beautifully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0140.mp3|and the weather|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0142.mp3|made us all cheerful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0143.mp3|you would scarcely have believed that the happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0146.mp3|it was a period of relaxation and they all enjoyed it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0147.mp3|amusement was the order of the day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0151.mp3|and dinner parties were eagerly indulged in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0152.mp3|and in all i could be of use to provide the good cheer which was so essential a part of these entertainments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0153.mp3|and when the warm weather came in all its intensity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0154.mp3|and i took to manufacturing cooling beverages for my friends and customers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0155.mp3|my store was always full|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0156.mp3|to please all was somewhat difficult|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0157.mp3|and occasionally some of them were scarcely so polite as they should have been to a perplexed hostess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0159.mp3|in anticipation of the hot weather|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0160.mp3|i had laid in a large stock of raspberry vinegar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0162.mp3|properly managed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0163.mp3|helps to make a pleasant drink|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0167.mp3|the cups being battered pewter pots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0168.mp3|would you like reader to know my recipe for the favourite claret cup|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0169.mp3|it is simple enough|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0174.mp3|but not often and not for long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0175.mp3|for the eager officers soon made an end of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0176.mp3|sometimes there were dinner parties at spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0178.mp3|at one of the earliest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0179.mp3|when the times correspondent was to be present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0181.mp3|bought some calico and cut it up into table napkins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0182.mp3|they all laughed very heartily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0183.mp3|and thought perhaps of a few weeks previously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0184.mp3|when every available piece of linen in the camp would have been snapped up for pocket handkerchiefs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0185.mp3|but the reader must not forget that all this time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0186.mp3|although there might be only a few short and sullen roars of the great guns by day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0187.mp3|few nights passed without some fighting in the trenches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0188.mp3|and very often the news of the morning would be that one or other of those i knew had fallen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0189.mp3|these tidings often saddened me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0190.mp3|and when i awoke in the night and heard the thunder of the guns fiercer than usual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0193.mp3|it was very usual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0194.mp3|when a young officer was ordered into the trenches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0195.mp3|for him to ride down to spring hill to dine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0197.mp3|they seldom failed on these occasions to shake me by the hand at parting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0198.mp3|and sometimes would say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0204.mp3|perhaps you'll see them some day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0207.mp3|just tell them i thought of them all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0208.mp3|will you and although all this might be said in a light hearted manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0209.mp3|it was rather solemn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0210.mp3|i felt it to be so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0211.mp3|for i never failed although who was i|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0212.mp3|that i should preach to say something about god's providence and relying upon it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0213.mp3|and they were very good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0214.mp3|no army of parsons could be much better than my sons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0215.mp3|they would listen very gravely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0216.mp3|and shake me by the hand again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0217.mp3|while i felt that there was nothing in the world i would not do for them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0218.mp3|then very often the men would say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0224.mp3|awaiting with anxiety the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0225.mp3|and yet dreading to hear the news it held in store for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0226.mp3|i used to think it was like having a large family of children ill with fever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0228.mp3|and as often as the bad news came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0229.mp3|i thought it my duty to ride up to the hut of the sufferer and do my woman's work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0230.mp3|but i felt it deeply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0231.mp3|how could it be otherwise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0232.mp3|there was one poor boy in the artillery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0233.mp3|with blue eyes and light golden hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0234.mp3|whom i nursed through a long and weary sickness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0236.mp3|and whom i grew to love like a fond old fashioned mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0237.mp3|i thought if ever angels watched over any life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0238.mp3|they would shelter his|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0239.mp3|but one day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0240.mp3|but a short time after he had left his sick bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0241.mp3|he was struck down on his battery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0242.mp3|working like a young hero|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0243.mp3|it was a long time before i could banish from my mind the thought of him as i saw him last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0244.mp3|the yellow hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0245.mp3|stiff and stained with his life blood|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0246.mp3|and the blue eyes closed in the sleep of death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0248.mp3|my old jamaica friend whose kind face was so familiar to me of old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0249.mp3|another good friend i mourned bitterly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0252.mp3|a great cricketer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0253.mp3|he had been with me on the previous evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0254.mp3|had seemed dull|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0255.mp3|but had supped at my store|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0256.mp3|and on the following morning a brother officer told me he was shot dead while setting his pickets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0257.mp3|which made me ill and unfit for work for the whole day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0260.mp3|but why should i sadden myself or my readers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0261.mp3|others have described the horrors of those fatal trenches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0262.mp3|but their real history has never been written|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0263.mp3|and perhaps it is as well that so harrowing a tale should be left in oblivion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0264.mp3|such anecdotes as the following were very current in the camp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0265.mp3|but i have no means of answering for its truth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0266.mp3|two sergeants met in the trenches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0267.mp3|who had been schoolmates in their youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0268.mp3|years had passed since they set out for the battle of life by different roads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0269.mp3|and now they met again under the fire of a common enemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0271.mp3|and while their hands were still clasped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_15_seacole_0272.mp3|a chance shot killed both|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0002.mp3|which the reader has already read in chapter fourteen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0003.mp3|in which he stated that i had frequently exerted myself in the most praiseworthy manner in attending wounded men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0004.mp3|even in positions of great danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0005.mp3|the simple meaning of this sentence is that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0006.mp3|in the discharge of what i conceived to be my duty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0007.mp3|i was frequently under fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0008.mp3|now i am far from wishing to speak of this fact with any vanity or pride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0009.mp3|because|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0011.mp3|one soon gets accustomed to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0012.mp3|and it fails at last to create more than temporary uneasiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0013.mp3|indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0014.mp3|after sebastopol was ours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0015.mp3|you might often see officers and men strolling coolly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0016.mp3|even leisurely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0017.mp3|across and along those streets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0018.mp3|exposed to the enemy's fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0019.mp3|when a little haste would have carried them beyond the reach of danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0022.mp3|they had grown so habituated to being in peril from shot or shell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0023.mp3|that they rather liked the sensation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0024.mp3|and found it difficult to get on without a little gratuitous excitement and danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0025.mp3|but putting aside the great engagements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0026.mp3|where i underwent considerable peril|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0027.mp3|one could scarcely move about the various camps without some risk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0029.mp3|it seemed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0031.mp3|from which they fired shot and shell at a very long range|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0032.mp3|which came tumbling and plunging between|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0033.mp3|and sometimes into the huts and tents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0034.mp3|in a very unwieldy and generally harmless fashion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0035.mp3|once when i was riding through the camp of the rifles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0036.mp3|a round shot came plunging towards me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0037.mp3|and before i or the horse had time to be much frightened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0038.mp3|the ugly fellow buried itself in the earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0039.mp3|with a heavy thud a little distance in front of us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0040.mp3|in the first week of june|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0041.mp3|the third bombardment of sebastopol opened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0042.mp3|and the spring hill visitors had plenty to talk about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0043.mp3|many were the surmises as to when the assault would take place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0044.mp3|of the success of which nobody entertained a doubt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0045.mp3|somehow or other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0046.mp3|important secrets oozed out in various parts of the camp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0047.mp3|which the russians would have given much to know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0048.mp3|and one of these places was the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0049.mp3|some such whispers were afloat on the evening of sunday the seventeenth of june|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0050.mp3|and excited me strangely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0051.mp3|any stranger not in my secret would have considered that my conduct fully justified my partner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0052.mp3|mister day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0053.mp3|in sending me home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0055.mp3|i never remember feeling more excited or more restless than upon that day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0056.mp3|and no sooner had night fairly closed in upon us than|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0057.mp3|instead of making preparations for bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0058.mp3|this same stranger would have seen me wrap up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0059.mp3|the nights were still cold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0061.mp3|three miles and a half away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0062.mp3|i stayed there until past midnight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0064.mp3|there was no rest for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0065.mp3|for i had found out that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0066.mp3|in the stillness of the night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0067.mp3|many regiments were marching down to the trenches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0068.mp3|and that the dawn of day would be the signal that should let them loose upon the russians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0069.mp3|the few hours still left before daybreak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0070.mp3|were made the most of at spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0071.mp3|we were all busily occupied in cutting bread and cheese and sandwiches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0072.mp3|packing up fowls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0075.mp3|wine and spirits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0076.mp3|while i carefully filled the large bag|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0077.mp3|which i always carried into the field slung across my shoulder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0082.mp3|and medicines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0083.mp3|and soon after daybreak everything was ready packed upon two mules|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0084.mp3|in charge of my steadiest lad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0085.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0086.mp3|i leading the way on horseback|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0088.mp3|it was not long before our progress was arrested by the cavalry pickets closely stationed to stop all stragglers and spectators from reaching the scene of action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0089.mp3|but after a blight parley and when they found out who i was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0090.mp3|and how i was prepared for the day's work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0091.mp3|the men raised a shout for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0093.mp3|with their officer's sanction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0094.mp3|allowed me to pass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0098.mp3|loaded myself with what provisions i could carry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0099.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0100.mp3|it was a work of no little difficulty and danger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0101.mp3|succeeded in reaching the reserves of sir henry barnard's division|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0102.mp3|which was to have stormed something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0103.mp3|i forget what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0105.mp3|very wisely abstained|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0106.mp3|here i found plenty of officers who soon relieved me of my refreshments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0107.mp3|and some wounded men who found the contents of my bag very useful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0109.mp3|where the temporary hospital had been erected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0110.mp3|and there i found the doctors hard enough at work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0111.mp3|and hastened to help them as best i could|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0112.mp3|i bound up the wounds and ministered to the wants of a good many|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0113.mp3|and stayed there some considerable time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0114.mp3|upon the way and even here i was under fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0118.mp3|upon these occasions those around would cry out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0122.mp3|and remain there until the same voices would laughingly assure me that the danger was over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0123.mp3|or one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0124.mp3|more thoughtful than the rest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0125.mp3|would come to give me a helping hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0127.mp3|several times in my wanderings on that eventful day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0128.mp3|of which i confess to have a most confused remembrance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0129.mp3|only knowing that i looked after many wounded men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0130.mp3|i was ordered back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0131.mp3|but each time my bag of bandages and comforts for the wounded proved my passport|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0132.mp3|while at the hospital i was chiefly of use looking after those|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0134.mp3|either from lack of hands or because their hurts were less serious|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0135.mp3|had to wait|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0136.mp3|pained and weary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0137.mp3|until the kind hearted doctors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0138.mp3|who however looked more like murderers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0139.mp3|could attend to them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0140.mp3|and the grateful words and smile which rewarded me for binding up a wound or giving cooling drink was a pleasure worth risking life for at any time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0141.mp3|it was here that i received my only wound during the campaign|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0142.mp3|i threw myself too hastily on the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0143.mp3|in obedience to the command of those around me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0144.mp3|to escape a threatening shell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0145.mp3|and fell heavily on the thumb of my right hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0146.mp3|dislocating it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0147.mp3|it was bound up on the spot and did not inconvenience me much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0148.mp3|but it has never returned to its proper shape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0149.mp3|after this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0150.mp3|first washing my hands in some sherry from lack of water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0151.mp3|i went back to cathcart's hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0152.mp3|where i found my horse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0153.mp3|and heard that the good for nothing lad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0154.mp3|either frightened or tired of waiting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0155.mp3|had gone away with the mules|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0156.mp3|i had to ride three miles after him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0157.mp3|and then the only satisfaction i had arose from laying my horse whip about his shoulders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0159.mp3|working my way round|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0160.mp3|how i can scarcely tell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0161.mp3|i got to the extreme left attack|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0163.mp3|and had suffered severely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0164.mp3|i left my horse in charge of some men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0165.mp3|and with no little difficulty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0166.mp3|and at no little risk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0167.mp3|crept down to where some wounded men lay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0168.mp3|with whom i left refreshments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0169.mp3|and then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0170.mp3|it was growing late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0171.mp3|i started for spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0172.mp3|where i heard all about the events of the luckless day from those who had seen them from posts of safety|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0174.mp3|who had been in the midst of it all day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0175.mp3|knew so little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0176.mp3|on the following day some irishmen of the eighth royals brought me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0177.mp3|in token of my having been among them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0178.mp3|a russian woman's dress and a poor pigeon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0179.mp3|which they had brought away from one of the houses in the suburb where their regiment suffered so severely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0180.mp3|but that evening of the eighteenth of june was a sad one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0181.mp3|and the news that came in of those that had fallen were most heartrending|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0182.mp3|both the leaders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0183.mp3|who fell so gloriously before the redan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0184.mp3|had been very good to the mistress of spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0187.mp3|instead of the poor shabby one i had been reduced to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0188.mp3|while sir john c had been my kind patron for some years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0191.mp3|and when the recall home came lady c|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0193.mp3|had she been like most women|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0194.mp3|would have shrunk from any exertion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0195.mp3|declared that she was a soldier's wife and would accompany him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0197.mp3|and i put into its father's arms a little scotchman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0198.mp3|born within sight of the blue hills of jamaica|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0199.mp3|and yet with these at home the brave general|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0200.mp3|as i read in the times a few weeks later|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0201.mp3|displayed a courage amounting to rashness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0204.mp3|rushed on to a certain death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0205.mp3|on the following day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0206.mp3|directly i heard of the armistice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0207.mp3|i hastened to the scene of action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0208.mp3|anxious to see once more the faces of those who had been so kind to me in life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0210.mp3|and if i do not pray god that i may never see its like again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0211.mp3|it is because i wish to be useful all my life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0212.mp3|and it is in scenes of horror and distress that a woman can do so much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0213.mp3|it was late in the afternoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0216.mp3|until half past four|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0217.mp3|that the russians brought over the bodies of the two leaders of yesterday's assault|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0220.mp3|how my heart felt for those at home who would so soon hear of this day's fatal work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0223.mp3|that i saw them bury him near cathcart's hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0224.mp3|where his tent had been pitched|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0225.mp3|if i had been in the least humour for what was ludicrous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0226.mp3|the looks and curiosity of the russians who saw me during the armistice would have afforded me considerable amusement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0227.mp3|i wonder what rank they assigned me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0228.mp3|how true it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0229.mp3|as somebody has said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0230.mp3|that misfortunes never come singly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0232.mp3|for while we were dull enough at this great trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0233.mp3|we had cholera raging around us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0234.mp3|carrying off its victims of all ranks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0235.mp3|there was great distress in the sardinian camp on this account|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0236.mp3|and i soon lost another good customer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0237.mp3|general e|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0238.mp3|carried off by the same terrible plague|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0240.mp3|left the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0241.mp3|she sent several useful things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0242.mp3|kept back from the sale of the general's effects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0244.mp3|but did not like to bid against lord w|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0245.mp3|who purchased it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0246.mp3|but i tell this anecdote to show how kind they all were to me when his lordship heard of this he sent it over to spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0247.mp3|with a message that it was mine for a far lower price than he had given for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0248.mp3|and since my return home i have had to thank the same nobleman for still greater favours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0249.mp3|but who indeed has not been kind to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0253.mp3|that great soldier who had such iron courage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0255.mp3|i was familiar enough with his person|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0258.mp3|he was continually in the saddle looking after his suffering men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0259.mp3|and scheming plans for their benefit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0260.mp3|and the humblest soldier will remember that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0261.mp3|let who might look stern and distant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0262.mp3|the first man in the british army ever had a kind word to give him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0265.mp3|i do not think they knew that he was dying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0266.mp3|but they seemed very sad and low|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0267.mp3|far more so than he for whom they feared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0268.mp3|and on the day of his funeral i was there again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0269.mp3|i never saw such heartfelt gloom as that which brooded on the faces of his attendants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0270.mp3|but it was good to hear how they all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0271.mp3|even the humblest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0272.mp3|had some kind memory of the great general whom providence had called from his post at such a season of danger and distress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0273.mp3|and once again they let me into the room in which the coffin lay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0274.mp3|and i timidly stretched out my hand and touched a corner of the union jack which lay upon it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0277.mp3|ever and anon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0278.mp3|the guns thundered forth in sorrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0279.mp3|not in anger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0281.mp3|it was not in the nature of the british army to remain long dull|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0283.mp3|forgetting the terrible eighteenth of june|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0284.mp3|or only remembering it to look forward to the next assault compensating for all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0286.mp3|and laughter and fun re echoed through its iron rafters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0287.mp3|nothing of consequence was done in the front for weeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0288.mp3|possibly because mister russell was taking holiday|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0289.mp3|and would not return until august|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0290.mp3|about this time the stores of the british hotel were well filled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0291.mp3|not only with every conceivable necessary of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0292.mp3|but with many of its most expensive luxuries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0293.mp3|it was at this period that you could have asked for few things that i could not have supplied you with on the spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0294.mp3|or obtained for you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0297.mp3|a poor place enough when we came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0298.mp3|had grown into a town of stores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0299.mp3|and had its market regulations and police|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0300.mp3|but the whole camp shared in this unusual plenty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0301.mp3|even the men could afford to despise salt meat and pork|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0302.mp3|and fed as well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0303.mp3|if not better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0304.mp3|than if they had been in quarters at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0306.mp3|and balls given in some of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0307.mp3|which raised my temper to an unwonted pitch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0308.mp3|because i foresaw the dangers which they had for the young and impulsive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0309.mp3|and sure enough they cost several officers their commissions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0310.mp3|right glad was i one day when the great purifier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0312.mp3|burnt down the worst of these places and ruined its owner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0313.mp3|a bad frenchwoman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0314.mp3|and the railway was in full work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0315.mp3|and the great road nearly finished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0316.mp3|and the old one passable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0317.mp3|and the mules and horses looked in such fair condition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0319.mp3|of the land transport corps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0320.mp3|who would have told you then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0322.mp3|that he superintended|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0323.mp3|on one bleak morning of february|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0324.mp3|not six months agone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0326.mp3|of course the summer introduced its own plagues|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0327.mp3|and among the worst of these were the flies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0328.mp3|i shall never forget those crimean flies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0329.mp3|and most sincerely hope that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0330.mp3|like the patagonians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0331.mp3|they are only to be found in one part of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0333.mp3|and accidentally given them wings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0334.mp3|there was no exterminating them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0335.mp3|no thinning them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0336.mp3|no escaping from them by night or by day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0337.mp3|one of my boys confined himself almost entirely to laying baits and traps for their destruction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0338.mp3|and used to boast that he destroyed them at the rate of a gallon a day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0339.mp3|but i never noticed any perceptible decrease in their powers of mischief and annoyance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0340.mp3|the officers in the front suffered terribly from them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0341.mp3|one of my kindest customers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0342.mp3|a lieutenant serving in the royal naval brigade|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0344.mp3|whose uniform he wore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0345.mp3|came to me in great perplexity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0346.mp3|he evidently considered the fly nuisance the most trying portion of the campaign|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0347.mp3|and of far more consequence than the russian shot and shell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0349.mp3|and so called me by the familiar term used by the creole children|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0351.mp3|these flies respect nothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0353.mp3|they set to at night and make a supper of me and his face showed traces of their attacks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0356.mp3|even in the trenches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0357.mp3|and you'd suppose they wouldn't care to go there from choice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0362.mp3|where i was lucky in being able to procure a piece of muslin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0363.mp3|which i pinned up time was too precious to allow me to use needle and thread into a mosquito net|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0364.mp3|with which the prince was delighted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0365.mp3|he fell ill later in the summer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0366.mp3|when i went up to his quarters and did all i could for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0367.mp3|as the summer wore on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0368.mp3|busily passed by all of us at the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0370.mp3|and i think that no one was much surprised when one pleasant august morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0371.mp3|at early dawn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0372.mp3|heavy firing was heard towards the french position on the right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0375.mp3|prepared and loaded as usual|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0376.mp3|i was soon riding in the same direction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0377.mp3|and saw the chief part of the morning's battle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0378.mp3|i saw the russians cross and recross the river|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0379.mp3|i saw their officers cheer and wave them on in the coolest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0380.mp3|bravest manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0381.mp3|until they were shot down by scores|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0382.mp3|i was near enough to hear at times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0383.mp3|in the lull of artillery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0385.mp3|the excited cheers which told of a daring attack or a successful repulse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0386.mp3|and beneath where i stood i could see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0387.mp3|what the russians could not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0388.mp3|steadily drawn up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0389.mp3|quiet and expectant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0390.mp3|the squadrons of english and french cavalry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0392.mp3|but the contingency never happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0393.mp3|and we saw the russians fall slowly back in good order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0395.mp3|and formed a picture so excitingly beautiful that we forgot the suffering and death they left behind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0396.mp3|and then i descended with the rest into the field of battle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0397.mp3|it was a fearful scene but why repeat this remark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0398.mp3|all death is trying to witness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0399.mp3|even that of the good man who lays down his life hopefully and peacefully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0401.mp3|when the poor body is torn and rent in hideous ways|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0403.mp3|death is fearful indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0404.mp3|it had come peacefully enough to some|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0405.mp3|they lay with half opened eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0406.mp3|and a quiet smile about the lips that showed their end to have been painless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0407.mp3|others it had arrested in the heat of passion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0408.mp3|and frozen on their pallid faces a glare of hatred and defiance that made your warm blood run cold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0409.mp3|but little time had we to think of the dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0410.mp3|whose business it was to see after the dying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0411.mp3|who might yet be saved|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0412.mp3|the ground was thickly cumbered with the wounded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0413.mp3|some of them calm and resigned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0414.mp3|others impatient and restless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0415.mp3|a few filling the air with their cries of pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0416.mp3|all wanting water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0417.mp3|and grateful to those who administered it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0418.mp3|and more substantial comforts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0419.mp3|you might see officers and strangers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0420.mp3|visitors to the camp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0421.mp3|riding about the field on this errand of mercy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0422.mp3|and this although|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0423.mp3|surely it could not have been intentional|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0424.mp3|russian guns still played upon the scene of action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0425.mp3|there were many others there bent on a more selfish task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0426.mp3|the plunderers were busy everywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0429.mp3|in their brutal work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0430.mp3|paying much regard to the presence of a lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0431.mp3|some of the officers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0432.mp3|when i complained rather angrily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0434.mp3|and said it was spoiling the egyptians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0435.mp3|but i do think the israelites spared their enemies those garments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0437.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0438.mp3|were not so unmentionable in those days as they have since become|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0439.mp3|i attended to the wounds of many french and sardinians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0440.mp3|and helped to lift them into the ambulances|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0441.mp3|which came tearing up to the scene of action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0442.mp3|i derived no little gratification from being able to dress the wounds of several russians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0443.mp3|indeed they were as kindly treated as the others|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0444.mp3|one of them was badly shot in the lower jaw|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0445.mp3|and was beyond my or any human skill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0446.mp3|incautiously i inserted my finger into his mouth to feel where the ball had lodged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0447.mp3|and his teeth closed upon it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0448.mp3|in the agonies of death|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0450.mp3|which was not done until it had been bitten so deeply that i shall carry the scar with me to my grave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0451.mp3|poor fellow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0452.mp3|he meant me no harm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0454.mp3|as the near approach of death softened his features|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0455.mp3|a smile spread over his rough inexpressive face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0456.mp3|and so he died|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0457.mp3|i attended another russian|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0460.mp3|shot in the side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0461.mp3|who bore his cruel suffering with a firmness that was very noble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0462.mp3|in return for the little use i was to him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0463.mp3|he took a ring off his finger and gave it to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0464.mp3|and after i had helped to lift him into the ambulance he kissed my hand and smiled far more thanks than i had earned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0465.mp3|i do not know whether he survived his wounds but i fear not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0468.mp3|gave me thanks in words the meaning of which was lost upon me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0469.mp3|and all of them in that one common language of the whole world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0471.mp3|i carried two patients off the field|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0473.mp3|who chose to go back to spring hill and be attended by me there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0475.mp3|on leaving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0477.mp3|the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0478.mp3|a poor cossack colt i found running round its dam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0479.mp3|which lay beside its cossack master dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0480.mp3|with its tongue hanging from its mouth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0482.mp3|and i was only just in time to prevent a french corporal who|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0483.mp3|perhaps for pity's sake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0485.mp3|i saved the poor thing by promising to give the frenchman ten shillings if he would bring it down to the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0486.mp3|which he did that same evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0488.mp3|and succeeded in rearing it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0489.mp3|and it became a great pet at spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0490.mp3|and accompanied me to england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0492.mp3|but not many|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0493.mp3|and those of little value|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0494.mp3|i cannot bear the idea of plundering either the living or the dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0495.mp3|but i picked up a russian metal cross|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0496.mp3|and took from the bodies of some of the poor fellows nothing of more value than a few buttons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0500.mp3|as all the world knows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_16_seacole_0501.mp3|on the sixteenth of august|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0002.mp3|i should think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0003.mp3|some of the busiest and most eventful the world has ever seen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0004.mp3|there was little doing at spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0005.mp3|every one was either at his post|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0006.mp3|or too anxiously awaiting the issue of the last great bombardment to spend much time at the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0007.mp3|i think that i lost more of my patients and customers during those few weeks than during the whole previous progress of the siege|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0008.mp3|scarce a night passed that i was not lulled to sleep with the heavy continuous roar of the artillery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0009.mp3|scarce a morning dawned that the same sound did not usher in my day's work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0012.mp3|and made us dull|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0013.mp3|and during the whole of this time the most perplexing rumours flew about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0014.mp3|some having reference to the day of assault|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0015.mp3|the majority relative to the last great effort which it was supposed the russians would make to drive us into the sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0017.mp3|spring hill being on the direct line of route which the actors in such a tragedy must take|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0018.mp3|i spent much of my time on cathcart's hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0019.mp3|watching|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0020.mp3|with a curiosity and excitement which became intense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0021.mp3|the progress of the terrible bombardment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0023.mp3|but it never disturbed us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0024.mp3|so keen and feverish and so deadened to danger had the excitement and expectation made us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0025.mp3|in the midst of the bombardment took place the important ceremony of distributing the order of the bath to those selected for that honour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0026.mp3|i contrived to witness this ceremony very pleasantly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0027.mp3|and although it cost me a day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0028.mp3|i considered that i had fairly earned the pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0029.mp3|i was anxious to have some personal share in the affair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0032.mp3|a cake which gunter might have been at some loss to manufacture with the materials at my command|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0033.mp3|and which i adorned gaily with banners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0036.mp3|i received great kindness from the officials at the ceremony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0037.mp3|and from the officers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0041.mp3|well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0042.mp3|a few days after this ceremony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0043.mp3|i thought the end of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0044.mp3|instead of the war|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0045.mp3|was at hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0046.mp3|when every battery opened and poured a perfect hail of shot and shell upon the beautiful city which i had left the night before sleeping so calm and peaceful beneath the stars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0047.mp3|the firing began at early dawn and was fearful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0048.mp3|sleep was impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0049.mp3|so i arose and set out for my old station on cathcart's hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0050.mp3|and here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0051.mp3|with refreshments for the anxious lookers on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0052.mp3|i spent most of my time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0053.mp3|right glad of any excuse to witness the last scene of the siege|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0054.mp3|it was from this spot that i saw fire after fire break out in sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0055.mp3|and watched all night the beautiful yet terrible effect of a great ship blazing in the harbour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0056.mp3|and lighting up the adjoining country for miles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0057.mp3|the weather changed as it often did in the crimea most capriciously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0058.mp3|and the morning of the memorable eighth of september broke cold and wintry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0059.mp3|the same little bird which had let me into so many secrets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0060.mp3|also gave me a hint of what this day was pregnant with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0061.mp3|and very early in the morning i was on horseback|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0062.mp3|with my bandages and refreshments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0063.mp3|ready to repeat the work of the eighteenth of june last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0065.mp3|even to cathcart's hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0066.mp3|but once more i found that my reputation served as a permit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0067.mp3|and the officers relaxed the rule in my favour everywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0069.mp3|early in the day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0070.mp3|i was in my old spot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0071.mp3|with my old appliances for the wounded and fatigued|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0074.mp3|that this day would so closely resemble the day of the last attack in its disastrous results|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0075.mp3|it was noon before the cannonading suddenly ceased|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0077.mp3|with a strange feeling of excitement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0078.mp3|the french tumble out of their advanced trenches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0080.mp3|onward they seemed to go into the dust and smoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0081.mp3|swallowed up by hundreds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0082.mp3|but they never returned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0083.mp3|and before long we saw workmen levelling parapets and filling up ditches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0084.mp3|over which they drove|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0085.mp3|with headlong speed and impetuosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0088.mp3|although the tide of battle still surged around it with violence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0089.mp3|and wounded men were borne from it in large numbers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0090.mp3|and before this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0091.mp3|our men had made their attack|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0092.mp3|and the fearful assault of the redan was going on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0093.mp3|and failing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0094.mp3|but i was soon too busy to see much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0099.mp3|in fast increasing numbers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0100.mp3|and engrossed our attention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0101.mp3|i now and then found time to ask them rapid questions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0102.mp3|but they did not appear to know anything more than that everything had gone wrong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0105.mp3|showed their gallantry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0106.mp3|and even recklessness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0107.mp3|conspicuously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0108.mp3|the wounded of the ladder and sandbag parties came up even with a laugh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0109.mp3|and joked about their hurts in the happiest conceivable manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0110.mp3|i saw many officers of the ninety seventh wounded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0112.mp3|as far as possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0113.mp3|i reserved my attentions for my old regiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0114.mp3|known so well in my native island|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0115.mp3|my poor ninety seventh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0116.mp3|their loss was terrible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0117.mp3|i dressed the wound of one of its officers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0118.mp3|seriously hit in the mouth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0120.mp3|and bandaged the hand of a third|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0121.mp3|terribly crushed by a rifle bullet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0122.mp3|in the midst of this we were often interrupted by those unwelcome and impartial russian visitors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0123.mp3|the shells|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0124.mp3|one fell so near that i thought my last hour was come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0126.mp3|although i had sufficient firmness to throw myself upon the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0127.mp3|i was so seriously frightened that i never thought of rising from my recumbent position until the hearty laugh of those around convinced me that the danger had passed by|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0128.mp3|afterwards i picked up a piece of this huge shell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0129.mp3|and brought it home with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0130.mp3|it was on this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0131.mp3|as on every similar occasion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0132.mp3|that i saw the times correspondent eagerly taking down notes and sketches of the scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0133.mp3|under fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0134.mp3|listening apparently with attention to all the busy little crowd that surrounded him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0135.mp3|but without laying down his pencil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0136.mp3|and yet finding time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0137.mp3|even in his busiest moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0138.mp3|to lend a helping hand to the wounded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0140.mp3|and his mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0141.mp3|albeit engrossed with far more important memories|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0142.mp3|found room to remember me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0143.mp3|i may well be proud of his testimony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0144.mp3|borne so generously only the other day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0145.mp3|and may well be excused for transcribing it from the columns of the times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0146.mp3|i have seen her go down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0147.mp3|under fire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0148.mp3|with her little store of creature comforts for our wounded men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0149.mp3|and a more tender or skilful hand about a wound or broken limb could not be found among our best surgeons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0150.mp3|i saw her at the assault on the redan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0152.mp3|at the fall of sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0154.mp3|not with plunder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0155.mp3|good old soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0156.mp3|but with wine bandages and food for the wounded or the prisoners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0158.mp3|and watched the city blazing beneath us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0159.mp3|awe struck at the terrible sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0162.mp3|and not till then did i leave for spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0163.mp3|i had little sleep that night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0165.mp3|while every now and then came reports which shook the earth to its centre|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0166.mp3|and yet i believe very many of the soldiers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0167.mp3|wearied with their day's labour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0168.mp3|slept soundly throughout that terrible night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0169.mp3|and awoke to find their work completed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0171.mp3|covered by the burning city|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0172.mp3|sebastopol was left|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0173.mp3|a heap of ruins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0174.mp3|to its victors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0175.mp3|and before noon on the following day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0176.mp3|none but dead and dying russians were in the south side of the once famous and beautiful mistress city of the euxine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0178.mp3|it gave great pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0179.mp3|but i almost think the soldiers would have been better pleased had the russians delayed their parting twelve hours longer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0180.mp3|and given the highlanders and their comrades a chance of retrieving the disasters of the previous day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0181.mp3|nothing else could wipe away the soreness of defeat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0182.mp3|or compensate for the better fortune which had befallen our allies the french|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0183.mp3|the news of the evacuation of sebastopol soon carried away all traces of yesterday's fatigue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0184.mp3|for weeks past i had been offering bets to every one that i would not only be the first woman to enter sebastopol from the english lines|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0185.mp3|but that i would be the first to carry refreshments into the fallen city|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0186.mp3|and now the time i had longed for had come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0187.mp3|i borrowed some mules from the land transport corps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0188.mp3|mine were knocked up by yesterday's work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0189.mp3|and loading them with good things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0190.mp3|started off with my partner and some other friends early on that memorable sunday morning for cathcart's hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0191.mp3|when i found that strict orders had been given to admit no one inside sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0192.mp3|i became quite excited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0193.mp3|and making my way to general garrett's quarters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0194.mp3|i made such an earnest representation of what i considered my right that i soon obtained a pass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0195.mp3|of which the following is a copy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0200.mp3|so many attached themselves to my staff|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0201.mp3|becoming for the nonce my attendants|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0202.mp3|that i had some difficulty at starting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0203.mp3|but at last i passed all the sentries safely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0204.mp3|much to the annoyance of many officers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0205.mp3|who were trying every conceivable scheme to evade them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0206.mp3|and entered the city|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0207.mp3|i can give you no very clear description of its condition on that sunday morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0208.mp3|a year and a half ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0209.mp3|many parts of it were still blazing furiously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0210.mp3|explosions were taking place in all directions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0211.mp3|every step had a score of dangers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0212.mp3|and yet curiosity and excitement carried us on and on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0213.mp3|i was often stopped to give refreshments to officers and men|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0214.mp3|who had been fasting for hours|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0215.mp3|some on the other hand had found their way to russian cellars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0216.mp3|and one body of men were most ingloriously drunk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0217.mp3|and playing the wildest pranks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0218.mp3|they were dancing yelling and singing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0219.mp3|some of them with russian women's dresses fastened round their waists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0220.mp3|and old bonnets stuck upon their heads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0221.mp3|i was offered many trophies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0224.mp3|so that the soldiers could afford to be liberal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0225.mp3|by one i was offered a great velvet sofa|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0226.mp3|another pressed a huge arm chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0227.mp3|which had graced some sebastopol study|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0229.mp3|while a third begged my acceptance of a portion of a grand piano|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0230.mp3|what i did carry away was very unimportant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0231.mp3|a gaily decorated altar candle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0232.mp3|studded with gold and silver stars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0233.mp3|which the present commander in chief condescended to accept as a sebastopol memorial|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0234.mp3|an old cracked china teapot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0236.mp3|a cracked bell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0238.mp3|and which i bore away on my saddle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0239.mp3|and a parasol given me by a drunken soldier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0240.mp3|he had a silk skirt on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0241.mp3|and torn lace upon his wrists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0242.mp3|and he came mincingly up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0243.mp3|holding the parasol above his head|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0244.mp3|and imitating the walk of an affected lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0245.mp3|to the vociferous delight of his comrades|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0246.mp3|and all this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0247.mp3|and much more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0248.mp3|in that fearful charnel city|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0249.mp3|with death and suffering on every side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0250.mp3|it was very hazardous to pass along some of the streets exposed to the fire of the russians on the north side of the harbour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0251.mp3|we had to wait and watch our opportunity and then gallop for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0252.mp3|some of us had close shaves of being hit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0255.mp3|we saw two officers emerge from a heap of ruins|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0256.mp3|covered and almost blinded with smoke and dust|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0257.mp3|from some such unlooked for explosion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0258.mp3|with considerable difficulty we succeeded in getting into the quarter of the town held by the french|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0259.mp3|where i was nearly getting into serious trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0260.mp3|i had loitered somewhat behind my party|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0262.mp3|with pardonable curiosity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0263.mp3|the adroitness with which a party of french were plundering a house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0264.mp3|and by the time my curiosity had been satisfied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0265.mp3|i found myself quite alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0266.mp3|my retinue having preceded me by some few hundred yards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0267.mp3|this would have been of little consequence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0268.mp3|had not an american sailor lad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0269.mp3|actuated either by mischief or folly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0271.mp3|and had they not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0272.mp3|instead of laughing at him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0273.mp3|credited his assertion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0274.mp3|and proceeded to arrest me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0275.mp3|now such a charge was enough to make a lion of a lamb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0276.mp3|so i refused positively to dismount|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0277.mp3|and made matters worse by knocking in the cap of the first soldier who laid hands upon me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0278.mp3|with the bell that hung at my saddle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0279.mp3|upon this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0280.mp3|six or seven tried to force me to the guard house in rather a rough manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0281.mp3|while i resisted with all my force|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0282.mp3|screaming out for mister day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0284.mp3|how i longed for a better one i need not tell the reader|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0285.mp3|in the midst of this scene came up a french officer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0287.mp3|and who took my part at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0288.mp3|and ordered them to release me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0289.mp3|although i rather weakened my cause|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0290.mp3|it was most natural that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0291.mp3|directly i was released|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0292.mp3|i should fly at the varlet who had caused me this trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0294.mp3|using my bell most effectually|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0296.mp3|when my party returned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0297.mp3|by their riding whips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0298.mp3|this little adventure took up altogether so much time that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0299.mp3|when the french soldiers had made their apologies to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0300.mp3|and i had returned the compliment to the one whose head had been dented by my bell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0301.mp3|it was growing late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0302.mp3|and we made our way back to cathcart's hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0304.mp3|a little french soldier begged hard of me to buy a picture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0305.mp3|which had been cut from above the altar of some church in sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0306.mp3|it was too dark to see much of his prize|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0307.mp3|but i ultimately became its possessor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0308.mp3|and brought it home with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0309.mp3|it is some eight or ten feet in length|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0310.mp3|and represents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0312.mp3|the madonna|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0313.mp3|i am no judge of such things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0314.mp3|but i think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0315.mp3|although the painting is rather coarse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0316.mp3|that the face of the virgin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0317.mp3|and the heads of cherubim that fill the cloud from which she is descending|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0319.mp3|there is a look of divine calmness and heavenly love in the madonna's face which is very striking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0321.mp3|perhaps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0322.mp3|during the long and awful siege many a knee was bent in worship before it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0323.mp3|and many a heart found comfort in its soft loving gaze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0324.mp3|on the following day i again entered sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0325.mp3|and saw still more of its horrors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0326.mp3|but i have refrained from describing so many scenes of woe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0328.mp3|the very recollection of that woeful hospital|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0329.mp3|where thousands of dead and dying had been left by the retreating russians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0330.mp3|is enough to unnerve the strongest and sicken the most experienced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0331.mp3|i would give much if i had never seen that harrowing sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0332.mp3|i believe some englishmen were found in it alive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0334.mp3|i made my way into the redan also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0335.mp3|although every step was dangerous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0336.mp3|and took from it some brown bread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0337.mp3|which seemed to have been left in the oven by the baker when he fled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0338.mp3|before many days were passed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0340.mp3|but in that quarter of the town held by the english the prospect was not sufficiently tempting for me to follow their example|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_17_seacole_0341.mp3|and so i saw out the remainder of the campaign from my old quarters at spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0001.mp3|the great work was accomplished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0002.mp3|sebastopol was taken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0003.mp3|the russians had retired sullenly to their stronghold on the north side of the harbour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0004.mp3|from which|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0005.mp3|every now and then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0006.mp3|they sent a few vain shot and shell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0008.mp3|but gave the experienced no concern|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0009.mp3|in a few days the camp could find plenty to talk about in their novel position|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0011.mp3|what was to be done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0012.mp3|more fighting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0013.mp3|another equally terrible and lengthy siege of the north|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0015.mp3|between whom the electric wires flashed many a message|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0016.mp3|in the meanwhile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0017.mp3|the real workers applied themselves to plan amusements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0018.mp3|and the same energy and activity which had made sebastopol a heap of ruins and a well filled cemetery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0020.mp3|and held them when made against a desperate foe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0023.mp3|set to work as eager to kill their present enemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0025.mp3|as they had lately been to destroy their fled enemies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0026.mp3|the russians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0027.mp3|all who were before sebastopol will long remember the beautiful autumn which succeeded to so eventful a summer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0028.mp3|and ushered in so pleasantly the second winter of the campaign|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0029.mp3|it was appreciated as only those who earn the right to enjoyment can enjoy relaxation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0030.mp3|the camp was full of visitors of every rank|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0031.mp3|they thronged the streets of sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0032.mp3|sketching its ruins and setting up photographic apparatus|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0033.mp3|in contemptuous indifference of the shot with which the russians generally favoured every conspicuous group|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0034.mp3|pleasure was hunted keenly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0035.mp3|cricket matches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0037.mp3|dinner parties|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0039.mp3|theatricals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0040.mp3|all found their admirers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0041.mp3|my restaurant was always full|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0042.mp3|and once more merry laughter was heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0043.mp3|and many a dinner party was held|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0044.mp3|beneath the iron roof of the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0045.mp3|several were given in compliment to our allies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0046.mp3|and many distinguished frenchmen have tested my powers of cooking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0047.mp3|you might have seen at one party some of their most famous officers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0048.mp3|at once were present a prince of the imperial family of france|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0050.mp3|and a certain corporal in the french service|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0051.mp3|who was perhaps the best known man in the whole army|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0054.mp3|and perhaps were not a little surprised as course after course made its appearance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0055.mp3|and to soup and fish succeeded turkeys|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0056.mp3|saddle of mutton|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0059.mp3|tongue|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0060.mp3|curry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0061.mp3|pastry of many sorts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0062.mp3|custards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0066.mp3|i took a peculiar pride in doing my best when they were present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0068.mp3|i wonder if the world will ever know more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0070.mp3|i used to guess something of those sufferings when i saw|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0071.mp3|even after the fall of sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0072.mp3|half starved french soldiers prowling about my store|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0073.mp3|taking eagerly even what the turks rejected as unfit for human food|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0074.mp3|and no one could accuse them of squeamishness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0076.mp3|and when this happens|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0077.mp3|the terrible distresses of the english army will pall before the unheard of sufferings of the french|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0078.mp3|it is true that they carried from sebastopol the lion's share of glory|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0079.mp3|my belief is that they deserved it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0080.mp3|having borne by far a larger proportion of suffering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0082.mp3|and at the dinner i have above alluded to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0083.mp3|the toast was responded to with such enthusiasm that i felt compelled to put my acknowledgments into the form of a little speech|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0085.mp3|the french prince was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0086.mp3|after this occasion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0087.mp3|several times at the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0089.mp3|and upon their leaving i told him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0090.mp3|quite forgetting his own connection with america|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0091.mp3|of my prejudice against the yankees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0092.mp3|he heard me for a little while and then he interrupted me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0095.mp3|what a pity i was not born a countess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0096.mp3|i am sure i should have made a capital courtier|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0097.mp3|witness my impromptu answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0098.mp3|i should never have guessed it prince|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0099.mp3|and he seemed amused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0100.mp3|with the theatricals directly i had nothing to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0101.mp3|had i been a little younger the companies would very likely have been glad of me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0104.mp3|but i lent them plenty of dresses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0107.mp3|how was i to know when i brought them what camp life was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0108.mp3|and in addition to this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0109.mp3|i found it necessary to convert my kitchen into a temporary green room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0111.mp3|to the wonderment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0112.mp3|and perhaps scandal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0113.mp3|of the black cook|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0114.mp3|the ladies of the company of the first royals were taught to manage their petticoats with becoming grace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0115.mp3|and neither to show their awkward booted ankles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0116.mp3|nor trip themselves up over their trains|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0117.mp3|it was a difficult task in many respects|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0118.mp3|although i laced them in until they grew blue in the face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0119.mp3|their waists were a disgrace to the sex|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0123.mp3|it was not until a year later that punch thought of using a clothes basket|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0124.mp3|and i would have given much for such a hint when i was dresser to the theatrical company of the first royals|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0125.mp3|the hair was another difficulty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0127.mp3|there was plenty in the camp|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0128.mp3|only it was in the wrong place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0129.mp3|and many an application was made to me for a set of curls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0130.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0132.mp3|my recollections of hunting in the crimea are confined to seeing troops of horsemen sweep by with shouts and yells after some wretched dog|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0133.mp3|once i was very nearly frightened out of my wits|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0134.mp3|my first impression being that the russians had carried into effect their old threat of driving us into the sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0135.mp3|by the startling appearance of a large body of horsemen tearing down the hill after|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0138.mp3|however i discovered in good time that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0139.mp3|in default of vermin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0140.mp3|they were chasing a brother officer with a paper bag|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0141.mp3|my experience of crimean races are perfect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0142.mp3|for i was present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0144.mp3|at all the more important meetings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0145.mp3|some of them took place before christmas and some after|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0146.mp3|but i shall exhaust the subject at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0148.mp3|and in particular|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0149.mp3|after i had sat up the whole night making preparations for the december races|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0151.mp3|i could not get my poor mules over the rough country|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0152.mp3|and found myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0153.mp3|in the middle of the day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0154.mp3|some miles from the course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0155.mp3|at last i gave it up as hopeless|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0156.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0157.mp3|dismounting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0158.mp3|sat down by the roadside to consider how i could possibly dispose of the piles of sandwiches|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0163.mp3|which had been prepared for the hungry spectators|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0164.mp3|at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0166.mp3|who expected me long before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0167.mp3|came to look after me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0168.mp3|and by their aid we reached the course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0169.mp3|i was better off at the next meeting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0170.mp3|for a kind hearted major of artillery provided me with a small bell tent that was very useful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0171.mp3|and enabled me to keep my stores out of reach of the light fingered gentry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0173.mp3|over this tent waved the flag of the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0177.mp3|for an accident happening to one captain d|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0178.mp3|he was brought to my tent insensible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0179.mp3|where i quickly improvised a couch of some straw|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0180.mp3|covered with the union jack|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0181.mp3|and brought him round|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0182.mp3|i mention this trifle to show how ready of contrivance a little campaigning causes one to become|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0183.mp3|i had several patients in consequence of accidents at the races|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0184.mp3|nor was i altogether free from accidents myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0186.mp3|after the armistice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0187.mp3|my cart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0188.mp3|on turning a sudden bend in the steep track|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0189.mp3|upset|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0190.mp3|and the crates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0191.mp3|containing plates and dishes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0192.mp3|rolled over and over until their contents were completely broken up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0195.mp3|i saved some glasses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0196.mp3|but not many|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0197.mp3|and some of the officers were obliged to drink out of stiff paper twisted into funnel shaped glasses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0198.mp3|it was astonishing how well the managers of these crimean races had contrived to imitate the old familiar scenes at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0199.mp3|you might well wonder where the racing saddles and boots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0200.mp3|and silk caps and jackets had come from|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0201.mp3|but our connection with england was very different to what it had been when i first came to the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0202.mp3|and many a wife and sister's fingers had been busy making the racing gear for the crimea meetings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0203.mp3|and in order that the course should still more closely resemble ascot or epsom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0206.mp3|i caught one of them behind my tent in the act of knocking off the neck of a bottle of champagne|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0207.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0209.mp3|the only excuse he offered was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0211.mp3|a few weeks before christmas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0212.mp3|happened that fearful explosion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0213.mp3|in the french ammunition park|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0214.mp3|which destroyed so many lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0215.mp3|we had experienced nothing at all like it before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0216.mp3|the earth beneath us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0217.mp3|even at the distance of three miles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0218.mp3|reeled and trembled with the shock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0219.mp3|and so great was the force of the explosion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0220.mp3|that a piece of stone was hurled with some violence against the door of the british hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0221.mp3|we all felt for the french very much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0223.mp3|and the unsuccessful assault upon the redan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0224.mp3|as they had done previously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0225.mp3|i saw several instances of unpleasantness and collision|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0226.mp3|arising from allusions to sore points|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0227.mp3|one in particular occurred in my store|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0228.mp3|the french when they wanted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0229.mp3|it was very seldom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0230.mp3|to wound the pride of the english soldiery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0231.mp3|used to say significantly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0232.mp3|in that jargon by which the various nations in the crimea endeavoured to obviate the consequences of what occurred at the tower of babel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0233.mp3|some time ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0238.mp3|usually led to recriminatory statements|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0239.mp3|and history was ransacked to find something consolatory to english pride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0240.mp3|once i noticed a brawny man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0241.mp3|of the army works corps|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0244.mp3|the frenchman seemed mischievously inclined|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0245.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0246.mp3|probably relying upon the good humour on the countenance of his gigantic companion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0251.mp3|i never saw any man look so helplessly angry as the englishman did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0252.mp3|for a few minutes he seemed absolutely rooted to the ground|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0253.mp3|of course he could have crushed his mocking friend with ease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0254.mp3|but how could he answer his taunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0257.mp3|a happy thought struck him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0261.mp3|waterloo was bono|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0262.mp3|waterloo was bono|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0263.mp3|it was as much as the people on the premises could do to part them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0264.mp3|so convulsed were we all with laughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0265.mp3|and before christmas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0266.mp3|occurred my first and last attack of illness in the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0267.mp3|it was not of much consequence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0268.mp3|nor should i mention it but to show the kindness of my soldier friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0269.mp3|i think it arose from the sudden commencement of winter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0270.mp3|for which i was but poorly provided|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0271.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0272.mp3|i soon received much sympathy and many presents of warm clothing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0274.mp3|but the most delicate piece of attention was shown me by one of the sappers and miners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0276.mp3|hearing the report that i was dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0277.mp3|positively came down to spring hill to take my measure for a coffin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0278.mp3|this may seem a questionable compliment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0279.mp3|but i really felt flattered and touched with such a mark of thoughtful attention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0281.mp3|and it was very good of the grateful fellow to determine that his old friend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0282.mp3|the mistress of spring hill|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0283.mp3|should have an honour conceded to so very few of the illustrious dead before sebastopol|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0284.mp3|so christmas came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0285.mp3|and with it pleasant memories of home and of home comforts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0286.mp3|with it came also news of home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0287.mp3|some not of the most pleasant description|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0288.mp3|and kind wishes from absent friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0289.mp3|a merry christmas to you writes one and many of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0290.mp3|although you will not write to us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0291.mp3|we see your name frequently in the newspapers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0292.mp3|from which we judge that you are strong and hearty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0293.mp3|all your old jamaica friends are delighted to hear of you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0294.mp3|and say that you are an honour to the isle of springs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0295.mp3|i wonder if the people of other countries are as fond of carrying with them everywhere their home habits as the english|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0296.mp3|i think not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0297.mp3|i think there was something purely and essentially english in the determination of the camp to spend the christmas day of eighteen fifty five after the good old home fashion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0298.mp3|it showed itself weeks before the eventful day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0299.mp3|in the dinner parties which were got up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0300.mp3|in the orders sent to england|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_18_seacole_0301.mp3|in the supplies which came out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0001.mp3|before the new year was far advanced we all began to think of going home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0002.mp3|making sure that peace would soon be concluded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0003.mp3|and never did more welcome message come anywhere than that which brought us intelligence of the armistice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0004.mp3|and the firing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0005.mp3|which had grown more and more slack lately|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0006.mp3|ceased altogether|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0007.mp3|of course the army did not desire peace because they had any distaste for fighting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0008.mp3|so far from it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0009.mp3|i believe the only more welcome intelligence would have been news of a campaign in the field|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0010.mp3|but they were most heartily weary of sieges|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0011.mp3|and the prospect of another year before the gloomy north of sebastopol damped the ardour of the most sanguine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0012.mp3|before the armistice was signed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0013.mp3|the russians and their old foes made advances of friendship|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0018.mp3|i wonder if they thought they all had my complexion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0019.mp3|i soon entered heartily into the then current amusement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0021.mp3|with the russians|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0022.mp3|i stole a march upon my companions by making the sign of the cross upon my bosom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0024.mp3|in exchange for some pence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0025.mp3|a little metal figure of some ugly saint|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0026.mp3|then we wrapped up halfpence in clay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0027.mp3|and received coins of less value in exchange|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0028.mp3|seeing a soldier eating some white bread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0029.mp3|i made signs of wanting some|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0030.mp3|and threw over a piece of money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0031.mp3|i had great difficulty in making the man understand me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0032.mp3|but after considerable pantomime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0033.mp3|with surprise in his round bullet eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0034.mp3|he wrapped up his bread in some paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0035.mp3|then coated it with clay and sent it over to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0036.mp3|i thought it would look well beside my brown bread taken from the strange oven in the terrible redan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0037.mp3|and that the two would typify war and peace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0038.mp3|there was a great traffic going on in such things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0039.mp3|and a wag of an officer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0040.mp3|who could talk russian imperfectly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0041.mp3|set himself to work to persuade an innocent russian that i was his wife|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0042.mp3|and having succeeded in doing so promptly offered to dispose of me for the medal hanging at his breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0043.mp3|the last firing of any consequence was the salutes with which the good tidings of peace were received by army and navy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0044.mp3|after this soon began the home going with happy faces and light hearts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0045.mp3|and some kind thoughts and warm tears for the comrades left behind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0046.mp3|i was very glad to hear of peace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0048.mp3|although it must have been apparent to every one that it would cause our ruin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0050.mp3|our shelves were filled with articles laid in at a great cost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0052.mp3|and which it would be equally impossible to carry home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0053.mp3|everything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0054.mp3|from our stud of horses and mules down to our latest consignments from home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0055.mp3|must be sold for any price|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0057.mp3|as it happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0058.mp3|for many things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0060.mp3|no purchaser could now be found|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0061.mp3|however more of this hereafter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0062.mp3|before leaving the crimea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0063.mp3|i made various excursions into the interior|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0066.mp3|and had a very amusing journey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0067.mp3|my companions were young and full of fun|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0068.mp3|and tried hard to persuade the russians that i was queen victoria|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0069.mp3|by paying me the most absurd reverence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0070.mp3|when this failed they fell back a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0071.mp3|and declared that i was the queen's first cousin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0072.mp3|anyhow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0073.mp3|they attracted crowds about me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0075.mp3|until the arrival of some highlanders in their uniform cut me out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0077.mp3|i found it necessary to go to beat up a russian merchant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0079.mp3|after the declaration of peace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0080.mp3|had purchased stores of us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0081.mp3|and some young officers made up a party for the purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0084.mp3|and some boxes to sit upon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0085.mp3|and set out very early|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0088.mp3|before parting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0089.mp3|with a cold duck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/7967/wonderfuladventures_19_seacole_0090.mp3|some cold meat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0000.mp3|who's at the front door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0001.mp3|asked luella's mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0002.mp3|coming in from the kitchen with a dish towel in her hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0003.mp3|i thought i heard the door bell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0005.mp3|said her sister from her vantage point at the crack of the sitting room door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0007.mp3|it couldn't be crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0009.mp3|who would telegraph now that hannah's dead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0013.mp3|her sister could easily look over her head into the hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0014.mp3|and her gaze was penetrative and alert|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0016.mp3|said lucretia apprehensively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0017.mp3|but i'm all of a tremble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0018.mp3|telegrams are dreadful things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0022.mp3|your aunt crete will have a fit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0023.mp3|wasn't there anything to pay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0024.mp3|who is it for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0026.mp3|a rather stout young woman in stylish attire|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0027.mp3|with her mother's keen features unsoftened by sentiment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0029.mp3|irreverently tearing open her mother's telegram and reading it as she came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0031.mp3|the aunt always felt secretly that they somehow blamed her for being of that type|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0032.mp3|it makes one so hard to fit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0034.mp3|and adding with a disparaging glance at her sister's dumpy form|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0035.mp3|so impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0036.mp3|at such times the aunt always wrinkled up her pleasant little forehead into a v upside down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0037.mp3|and trotted off to her kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0039.mp3|or whatever was the present task|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0040.mp3|sighing helplessly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0041.mp3|she tried to be the best that she could always|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0042.mp3|but one couldn't help one's figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0043.mp3|especially when one was partly dependent on one's family for support|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0044.mp3|and dressmakers and tailors took so much money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0045.mp3|it was bad enough to have one stout figure to fit in the family without two|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0046.mp3|and the aunt always felt called upon to have as little dressmaking done as possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0048.mp3|clothes do make a big difference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0049.mp3|she reflected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0050.mp3|and sometimes when she was all alone in the twilight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0051.mp3|and there was really nothing that her alert conscience could possibly put her hand to doing for the moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0052.mp3|she amused herself by thinking what kind of dress she would buy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0053.mp3|and who should make it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0054.mp3|if she should suddenly attain a fortune|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0055.mp3|but this was a harmless amusement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0056.mp3|inasmuch as she never let it make her discontented with her lot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0057.mp3|or ruffle her placid brow for an instant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0058.mp3|but just now she was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0059.mp3|all of a tremble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0063.mp3|flinging herself into the most comfortable rocker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0064.mp3|and throwing her mother's telegram on the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0065.mp3|that's not to be tolerated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0066.mp3|something'll have to be done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0067.mp3|we'll have to go to the shore at once mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0068.mp3|i should die of mortification to have a country cousin come around just now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0070.mp3|i can't afford to ruin all my chances for a cousin i've never seen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0071.mp3|mother you simply must do something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0072.mp3|i won't stand it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0074.mp3|said her mother impatiently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0076.mp3|or why didn't you give it to me at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0077.mp3|where are my glasses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0078.mp3|the aunt waited meekly while her sister found her glasses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0079.mp3|and read the telegram|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0081.mp3|that is provoking to have him turn up just now of all times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0082.mp3|something must be done of course|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0084.mp3|and as you say we've never seen him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0085.mp3|it can't make much difference to him whether he sees us or not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0086.mp3|we can hurry off and be conveniently out of the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0089.mp3|and i always heard the child was more like his father than his mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0090.mp3|besides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0091.mp3|hannah married and went away to live when i was only a little girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0092.mp3|i really don't think donald has much claim on us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0093.mp3|what a long telegram|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0094.mp3|it must have cost a lot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0095.mp3|was it paid for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0096.mp3|it shows he knows nothing of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0097.mp3|or he would have put it in a few words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0098.mp3|well we'll have to get away at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0099.mp3|she crumpled the telegram into a ball|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0100.mp3|and flung it to the table again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0101.mp3|but it fell wide of its mark and dropped to the floor instead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0102.mp3|the aunt patiently stooped and picked it up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0103.mp3|smoothing out the crushed yellow paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0105.mp3|she said gently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0106.mp3|and she touched the yellow paper as if it had been something sacred|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0108.mp3|and shall make you a little visit if convenient|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0110.mp3|she sat down suddenly in the nearest chair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0111.mp3|somehow the relief from anxiety had made her knees weak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0113.mp3|she murmured again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0114.mp3|and laid her hand caressingly over the telegram|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0115.mp3|smoothing down a torn place in the edge of the paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0116.mp3|luella and her mother were discussing plans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0117.mp3|they had decided that they must leave on the early train the next morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0122.mp3|she looks as if she had seen a ghost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0123.mp3|her lips are all white|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0125.mp3|as if a telegram would hurt you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0126.mp3|there's nobody left to be worried about like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0127.mp3|why don't you use your reason a little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0130.mp3|upon my word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0133.mp3|instead of a downright calamity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0135.mp3|wouldn't you be glad to see your oldest sister's child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0136.mp3|hannah was always very dear to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0137.mp3|i can see her now the way she looked when she went away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0138.mp3|so tall and slim and pretty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0139.mp3|not if she'd been dead for a century or so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0140.mp3|and i'd never seen the child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0142.mp3|embarrassing creature who would spoil the prospects of the people i was supposed to love|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0143.mp3|retorted luella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0144.mp3|aunt crete don't you care the least bit for my happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0145.mp3|do you want it all spoiled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0148.mp3|but i don't see how it will spoil your happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0149.mp3|i should think you'd want to see him yourself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0151.mp3|the idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0152.mp3|he's nothing to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0159.mp3|if clarence grandon should see him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0160.mp3|he might imagine my family were all like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0161.mp3|and then where would i be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0162.mp3|yes crete i'm surprised at you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0164.mp3|and now you talk just as if you didn't care in the least what happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0166.mp3|but what can you do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0168.mp3|you can't tell him not to come your own sister's child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0170.mp3|said her sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0172.mp3|of course we can't very well tell him not to come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0173.mp3|as he hasn't given us a chance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0174.mp3|for this telegram is evidently sent on the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0176.mp3|he doesn't live in chicago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0178.mp3|now you know we've simply got to go to the shore next week|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0184.mp3|as you weren't going anyway you can receive him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0185.mp3|it will keep him quietly at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0187.mp3|and show him the sights|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0188.mp3|so nobody will notice him much and there won't be a lot of talk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0191.mp3|you might explain he's the son of an old school friend who went out west to live years ago|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0194.mp3|that wouldn't be true and besides he can't be so very bad as that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0195.mp3|and even if he is i shall love him for he's hannah's boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0196.mp3|love him all you want to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0197.mp3|sniffed her sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0198.mp3|but for pity's sake don't let the neighbors know what relation he is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0199.mp3|that's just like you aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0201.mp3|you've known me and pretended to love me all your life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0202.mp3|i'm almost like your own child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0206.mp3|and wiped away the beads of perspiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0207.mp3|somehow it always seemed that she was in the wrong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0208.mp3|would she be understood in heaven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0209.mp3|she wondered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0210.mp3|luella and her mother went on planning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0214.mp3|but i guess you can manage alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0215.mp3|you always do the biggest part of the canning anyway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0217.mp3|i meant to fit your two thin dresses before we went away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0222.mp3|if you think you can't wait till we get back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0223.mp3|you'll hardly be going out much while we're gone you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0225.mp3|said aunt crete happily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0227.mp3|donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0229.mp3|it won't matter what you wear while he's here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0230.mp3|he'll never know a calico from a silk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0233.mp3|you've got to be awfully careful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0234.mp3|or you'll let out when we went off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0235.mp3|there's no use in his finding out we didn't want to see him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0236.mp3|you wouldn't want to hurt his feelings you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0237.mp3|your own sister's child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0238.mp3|no of course not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0240.mp3|she never liked prevarication|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0243.mp3|she nearly always got it twisted so that it was either an out and out lie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0244.mp3|which horrified her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0247.mp3|as luella said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0248.mp3|but there was little time for discussion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0250.mp3|and aunt crete had the dinner to get and the house to set in order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0251.mp3|surreptitiously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0252.mp3|for the expected guest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0254.mp3|they had baggage enough for a year in europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0255.mp3|although they expected to stay only two or three weeks at the shore at most|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0256.mp3|aunt crete helped them into the station cab|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0258.mp3|back again for the veil and her sister's gloves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0259.mp3|and still a third time to bring the new book|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0260.mp3|which had been set aside for reading on the journey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0261.mp3|then at last they were gone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0262.mp3|and with one brief sigh of satisfaction aunt crete permitted herself to reflect that she was actually left alone to receive a dear guest all her own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0263.mp3|never in all her maiden existence had she had this pleasure before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0264.mp3|she might use the best china|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0265.mp3|and have three kinds of pie at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0266.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0267.mp3|and plum cake if she chose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0268.mp3|boys like pie and cake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0269.mp3|donald would be a big nice boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0270.mp3|what did it matter to her if he was awkward and from the west|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0271.mp3|he was in a large sense her own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0272.mp3|hannah was gone and there was no one else to take a closer place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0273.mp3|who but his mother's sister should have the right to mother him for a while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0276.mp3|besides luella had been a disappointing baby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0277.mp3|even in her infancy she had developed an independence that scorned kissing and cuddling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0279.mp3|her frown was always quicker than her smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0280.mp3|but somehow aunt crete felt that it would be different with this boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0281.mp3|and her heart swelled within her as she hurried into the house to make ready for his coming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0282.mp3|the front hall was littered with rose leaves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0284.mp3|and had found they were all loose leaves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0285.mp3|therefore she flung them down upon the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0288.mp3|for it suggested a possible admirer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0291.mp3|a few of luella's friends had come in for a few minutes the evening before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0292.mp3|and they had indulged in peanuts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0293.mp3|finishing up by throwing the shells at one another amid shouts of hilarious laughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0294.mp3|aunt crete went for the broom and dust pan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0297.mp3|for the tickets were barely bought and the trunks checked before the train thundered up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0298.mp3|it was a through vestibuled train|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0299.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0301.mp3|a tall young man with dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0302.mp3|handsome eyes and a distinguished manner swung himself down the steps of the next car|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0303.mp3|hello luella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0304.mp3|called a voice from a pony cart by the platform|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0305.mp3|you're not going away to day are you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0306.mp3|thought you said you weren't going till next week|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0307.mp3|circumstances made it necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0309.mp3|i'm running away from a backwoods cousin that's coming to visit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0310.mp3|i'll write and tell you all about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0312.mp3|sorry i can't be at your house to morrow night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0313.mp3|but it couldn't be helped|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0314.mp3|then luella turned another gaze upon the handsome stranger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0315.mp3|who was standing on the platform just below her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0316.mp3|looking about interestedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0317.mp3|she thought he had looked at her more than casually|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0319.mp3|as she settled herself in the seat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0320.mp3|she glanced down at her pongee travelling suit consciously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0321.mp3|feeling that he could but have thought she looked well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0322.mp3|he was still standing on the platform as the train moved out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0325.mp3|it would be interesting to find out who he was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0327.mp3|and settled her large hat in front of the strip of mirror between the windows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0328.mp3|and then looked around the car that she might see who were her fellow passengers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0329.mp3|well i'm glad we're off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0330.mp3|said her mother nervously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0331.mp3|i was afraid as could be your cousin might come in on that early through train before we got started|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0332.mp3|it would have been trying if he'd come just as we were getting away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0333.mp3|i don't know how we could have explained it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0334.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0336.mp3|i'm glad we're safely off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0337.mp3|he'll never suspect now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0338.mp3|it was just at that moment that the grocery boy arrived at the back door with a crate of red raspberries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0341.mp3|i hoped those wouldn't come till to morrow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0342.mp3|she bustled about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0343.mp3|taking the boxes out of the crate so that the boy might take it back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0344.mp3|and before she was done the door bell rang|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0345.mp3|land alive|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0347.mp3|taking off her apron as she went|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0348.mp3|i do hope he hasn't come yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0349.mp3|i haven't cleared off that breakfast table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0351.mp3|but the thought had come too late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0352.mp3|the dining room door was stretched wide open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0353.mp3|and the table in full view|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0354.mp3|the front door was guarded only by the wire screen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_01_hill_0355.mp3|the visitor had been able to take full notes if he so desired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0001.mp3|and noticed the fine appearance of the young man standing there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0002.mp3|he was not shabby enough for an agent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0003.mp3|some one had made a mistake she supposed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0004.mp3|she waited pleasantly for him to tell his errand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0007.mp3|he asked removing his hat courteously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0008.mp3|and when she answered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0009.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0010.mp3|his whole face broke into dancing eagerness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0013.mp3|and he held out a tentative appealing hand for welcome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0015.mp3|said miss lucretia delightedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0016.mp3|and she took his hand in both her own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0018.mp3|but i'm just as glad to see you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0019.mp3|i didn't think you'd be so big and handsome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0021.mp3|they've just why that is they are they had planned to be at the shore for three weeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0022.mp3|and they'll be real sorry when they know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0023.mp3|this last sentence was added with extra zeal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0025.mp3|she felt sure that if they had known how fine looking a young man he was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0026.mp3|they would have stayed and been proud of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0027.mp3|i'm sorry they are away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0028.mp3|said the young man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0030.mp3|comfortable cheek|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0031.mp3|but i'm mighty glad you're at home aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0032.mp3|he said with genuine pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0033.mp3|i'm going to like you for all i'm worth to make up for the absence of my aunt and cousin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0034.mp3|you say they have gone to the shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0035.mp3|when will they be at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0037.mp3|why no|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0038.mp3|said aunt crete flushing uncomfortably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0039.mp3|they haven't been gone long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0040.mp3|and they've engaged their rooms there for three weeks at a big hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0042.mp3|she's always been bound to go to one of those big places where rich people go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0044.mp3|it's advertised in all the papers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0045.mp3|i expect you've seen it sometimes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0046.mp3|it's one of the most expensive places at the shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0047.mp3|i've almost a notion to write and tell them to come home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0049.mp3|but you see it's this way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0051.mp3|and he's going down there soon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0052.mp3|i don't know but he's there already|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0053.mp3|and his mother and sister are spending the whole season there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0055.mp3|ah i see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0056.mp3|said the nephew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0057.mp3|well it wouldn't do to spoil my cousin's good time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0058.mp3|perhaps we can run down to the shore for a few days ourselves after we get acquainted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0060.mp3|i was so tired of the stuff they had on the dining car i thought i'd save up my appetite till i got here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0063.mp3|bless your dear heart yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0065.mp3|for she had a terrible fear she would yet tell a lie about the departure of her sister and niece|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0066.mp3|and a lie was a calamity not always easily avoided in a position like hers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0069.mp3|and wait about two minutes till i set the coffee pot over the fire and cut some more bread|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0071.mp3|for i hadn't cleared off the breakfast table yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0075.mp3|the grocery boy came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0078.mp3|she finished triumphantly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0079.mp3|she hurried out into the dining room to get the table cleared off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0080.mp3|but donald followed her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0082.mp3|but she could not be sure whether he noticed the table or not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0083.mp3|may i help you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0084.mp3|asked the young man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0086.mp3|and following her into the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0087.mp3|it's so good to get into a real home again with somebody who belongs to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0088.mp3|you know father is in mexico|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0089.mp3|and i've been in the university for the last four years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0090.mp3|the university|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0091.mp3|aunt crete's eyes shone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0092.mp3|do you have universities out west|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0094.mp3|won't luella be astonished|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0095.mp3|i guess she thinks out west is all woods|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0096.mp3|donald's eyes danced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0097.mp3|we have a few good schools out there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0098.mp3|he said quietly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0099.mp3|while they were eating the breakfast that aunt crete prepared in an incredibly short space of time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0100.mp3|donald asked a great many questions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0101.mp3|what did his aunt and cousin look like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0103.mp3|and luella had she been to college|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0104.mp3|and what did she look like|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0106.mp3|and it seems sometimes as if she blamed me for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0107.mp3|said the patient aunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0111.mp3|dumpy figures like mine don't dress up pretty you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0113.mp3|she didn't take much to books|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0114.mp3|she liked having a good time with young folks better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0115.mp3|she's been wanting to go down to the shore and be at a real big hotel for three summers now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0116.mp3|but carrie never felt able to afford it before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0118.mp3|and i do hope she'll have a good time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0119.mp3|it's real hard on her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0120.mp3|having to stay right home all the time when all her girl friends go off to the shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0121.mp3|but you see she's got in with some real wealthy people who stay at expensive places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0122.mp3|and she isn't satisfied to go to a common boarding house|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0123.mp3|it must be nice to have money and go to a big hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0124.mp3|i've never been in one myself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0125.mp3|but luella has and she's told all about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0128.mp3|said the young man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0129.mp3|i do hope i didn't keep you at home to entertain me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0131.mp3|said the aunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0132.mp3|i wasn't going|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0133.mp3|i never go anywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0134.mp3|why what kind of a figure would i cut there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0137.mp3|she always wants me to wear a coat when i go anywhere with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0138.mp3|so people won't see how short waisted i am|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0140.mp3|said donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0141.mp3|i think you are lovely aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0143.mp3|and you've got a fine face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0144.mp3|luella ought to be proud to have you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0146.mp3|and choking tears of joy throbbed for a minute in her throat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0148.mp3|she exclaimed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0149.mp3|donald do have another cup of coffee|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0151.mp3|and then hurried down to get the stack of dishes out of the way before he came down again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0152.mp3|but he appeared in the kitchen door in a few minutes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0153.mp3|give me a dish and some berries|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0155.mp3|i'm going to help you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0158.mp3|with her face shining as brightly as if she had done nothing but play the whole morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0159.mp3|we did well didn't we|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0160.mp3|said donald as he ate his dinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0161.mp3|i haven't had such a good time since i went camping in the klondike|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0162.mp3|now after we get these dishes washed you are going to take a nice long nap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0163.mp3|you look tired and warm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0164.mp3|aunt crete protested that she was not tired but donald insisted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0165.mp3|i want you to get nice and rested up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0166.mp3|because to morrow we're going shopping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0167.mp3|by the way i've brought you a present|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0169.mp3|aunt crete's heart beat with anticipation as he handed her a little white box|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0171.mp3|how she would like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0172.mp3|she had worn her mother's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0174.mp3|with a gold band under it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0175.mp3|ever since she was grown up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0176.mp3|and sometimes she felt as if it was a little old fashioned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0177.mp3|luella openly scoffed at it and laughed at her for wearing it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0178.mp3|but no one ever suggested getting her a new one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0180.mp3|if she had ventured to buy one for herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0181.mp3|she knew they would have thought her extravagant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0182.mp3|she opened the box with excited fingers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0183.mp3|and there inside was a little leather case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0185.mp3|and it flew open and disclosed a lovely star made all of seed pearls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0186.mp3|reposing on white velvet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0189.mp3|indeed and one fit for a queen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0190.mp3|fortunately aunt crete did not know enough about jewelry to realize what it cost|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0191.mp3|or her breath might have been taken away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0192.mp3|as it was she was dumb for the moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0193.mp3|such a beautiful pin and for her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0194.mp3|she could scarcely believe it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0195.mp3|she gazed and gazed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0197.mp3|laying the box on the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0198.mp3|rose up and took donald's face in her two toil worn hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0200.mp3|i'm glad you like it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0201.mp3|he said with a pleased smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0202.mp3|i wasn't quite sure what to get|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0203.mp3|but the salesman told me these were always nice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0204.mp3|now let's get at these dishes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0207.mp3|when had she ever taken a nap in the daytime before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0208.mp3|not since she was a little girl and fell from the second story window|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0209.mp3|the family had rushed around her frightened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0210.mp3|and put her to bed in the daytime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0211.mp3|and for one whole day she had been waited upon and cared for tenderly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0212.mp3|then she had been able to get up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0213.mp3|and the hard careless toilsome world had rushed on again for her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0214.mp3|but the memory of that blessed day of rest|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0215.mp3|touched by gentleness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0217.mp3|she had always been the one that did the hard things in her family|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0218.mp3|even when she was quite young|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0219.mp3|aunt crete lay cautiously down upon her neatly made bed after she had attired herself in her best gown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0221.mp3|and clasped her hands blissfully on her breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0222.mp3|resting with her eyes wide open and a light of joy upon her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0223.mp3|she hardly felt it right to relax entirely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0224.mp3|lest donald might call her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0225.mp3|but finally the unaccustomed position in the middle of the day sent her off into a real doze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0226.mp3|and just about that time the telephone bell rang|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0228.mp3|it had been put in at the time when the telephone company were putting them in free to introduce them in that suburb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0229.mp3|it was ordinarily a source of great interest to the whole family|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0231.mp3|luella and her mother were exceedingly proud of its possession|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0232.mp3|donald was in the sitting room reading|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0233.mp3|he looked up from his paper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0234.mp3|hesitated a moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0235.mp3|and then took down the receiver|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0236.mp3|perhaps his aunt was asleep already|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0237.mp3|and he could attend to this without waking her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0239.mp3|donald glanced at the number on the telephone and answered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0242.mp3|here is midvale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0243.mp3|went on the voice of the operator at central|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0251.mp3|for heaven's sake don't you tell that crazy cousin of ours where to find us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0253.mp3|and i should simply die of mortification if he did|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0256.mp3|now be sure you keep dark|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0257.mp3|i'll never forgive you if you don't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0263.mp3|i forgot all about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0264.mp3|it's on the bed in the spare room and the edging is started|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0265.mp3|you sew it on the way it is begun|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0266.mp3|you'll see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0267.mp3|now don't you go to sewing it on in that old way because it is quicker|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0271.mp3|anyway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0276.mp3|and tell her you'll finish them for her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0278.mp3|because she has to send the box off by the end of the week|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0280.mp3|and she wondered if you'd feel equal to whitewashing it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0281.mp3|i should think you'd like to do that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0282.mp3|it's so cool this warm weather to be down cellar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0285.mp3|if you get lonesome and want something to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0287.mp3|now don't read your eyes out the way you did the last time we went off and left you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0288.mp3|and have to wear dark glasses for a week|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0289.mp3|because i have lots of things planned to do when i get home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0290.mp3|i'm going to have helena bates for a week|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0291.mp3|and there'll be several lunches and picnics doing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0294.mp3|mother says|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0297.mp3|and be sure and stone them all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0298.mp3|i just hate them with the seeds in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0299.mp3|and i guess that's all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0302.mp3|are you all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0304.mp3|there was something else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0307.mp3|he's only a country boy you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0308.mp3|say aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0310.mp3|why don't you answer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0312.mp3|hello|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0314.mp3|hello central|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0316.mp3|i suppose she's gone away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0317.mp3|that's the way aunt crete always does|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0318.mp3|donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0320.mp3|amused expression upon his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0321.mp3|stood listening and hesitating|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0322.mp3|he did not know exactly what to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0323.mp3|without any intention at all he had listened to a conversation not intended for his ears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0324.mp3|should he answer and tell who he was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0325.mp3|no for that would but embarrass luella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0326.mp3|neither would it do to call aunt crete now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0327.mp3|for they would be sure to find out he had heard|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0328.mp3|perhaps it was better to keep entirely still|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0329.mp3|there seemed to be nothing serious at stake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0333.mp3|and whitewashing the cellar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0334.mp3|nobody would die if none of them were done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0335.mp3|and his blood boiled over the tone in which the invisible cousin at the other end of the wire had ordered aunt crete about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0336.mp3|he could read the whole life story of the patient self sacrifice on the one hand and imposition on the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0337.mp3|he felt strongly impelled to do something in the matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0338.mp3|a rebuke of some sort should be administered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0339.mp3|how could it best be done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0341.mp3|and the girl was declaring that she could get no answer from midvale any more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0342.mp3|donald stood wickedly enjoying their discomfiture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0343.mp3|and was at last rewarded by hearing luella say|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0344.mp3|well i guess i've said all i want to say anyway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0345.mp3|so you needn't ring them up again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0346.mp3|i've got to go out boating now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0347.mp3|the receiver at the shore clicked into place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0348.mp3|and the connection was cut off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0350.mp3|and sat down to think|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0351.mp3|bit by bit he pieced together the story until he had very nearly made out the true state of affairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0352.mp3|so they were ashamed of him and were trying to get away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0353.mp3|could it be possible that they had been the people that got on the train as he got off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0355.mp3|the voice over the telephone seemed like the one that had called to the girl in the pony cart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0356.mp3|and had his eyes deceived him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0357.mp3|or were there three plates on the breakfast table that morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0358.mp3|poor aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0359.mp3|he would give her the best time he knew how|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_02_hill_0360.mp3|and perhaps it was also set for him to give his cousin a lesson|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0001.mp3|she thought carrie and luella had come back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0002.mp3|and were about to snatch donald away from her and bear him off to the shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0003.mp3|she arose in haste and smoothed her hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0004.mp3|astonished at the freshness of her own face in the glass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0005.mp3|she was afraid she had overslept and lost some of the precious time with donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0006.mp3|there was so much to ask him and he was so good to look at|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0007.mp3|she hurried down and was received warmly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0008.mp3|donald's meditations had culminated in a plan|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0010.mp3|then i want to talk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0011.mp3|suppose we run down to the shore and surprise the folks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0012.mp3|how soon could you be ready|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0014.mp3|i couldn't do that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0015.mp3|exclaimed aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0016.mp3|her face nevertheless alight with pleasure at the very thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0017.mp3|why not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0018.mp3|what's to hinder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0020.mp3|i always stay at home and attend to things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0021.mp3|but that's no reason|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0023.mp3|why i couldn't leave the house alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0025.mp3|what in the world could possibly happen to the house that you could prevent by staying in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0026.mp3|be reasonable dear aunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0030.mp3|i'll get you another one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0031.mp3|you don't mean to tell me you never go off on a vacation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0032.mp3|then it's high time you went|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0033.mp3|and you'll have to stay the longer to make up for lost time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0034.mp3|besides i want your company|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0035.mp3|i've never seen the eastern coast and expect to enjoy it hugely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0036.mp3|but i need somebody to enjoy it with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0038.mp3|i want somebody my very own to go with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0039.mp3|that's what i came here for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0040.mp3|i had thought of inviting you all to go down for a little trip|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0041.mp3|but as the others are down there why we can join them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0043.mp3|what would luella say at having them appear on her horizon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0044.mp3|the young man was all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0045.mp3|apparently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0047.mp3|she knew that luella preferred to keep her in the background|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0048.mp3|i really couldn't go dear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0049.mp3|she said wistfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0050.mp3|i'd like it with all my heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0051.mp3|and it would be specially nice to go with you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0052.mp3|for i never had anybody to go round with me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0053.mp3|not since your mother was a girl and used to take me with her wherever she went|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0054.mp3|i missed her dreadfully after she was married and went west|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0055.mp3|she was always so good to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0056.mp3|the young man's face softened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0057.mp3|and he reached his hand impulsively across the table|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0058.mp3|and grasped the toil worn hand of his aunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0060.mp3|that is if you'll let me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0062.mp3|you just must go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0063.mp3|we'll have a vacation all by ourselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0064.mp3|and do just as we please|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0067.mp3|but child i can't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0068.mp3|said aunt crete in dismay seeing his determination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0069.mp3|why i haven't any clothes suitable to wear away from home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0070.mp3|we were all so busy getting luella fixed out that there wasn't any time left for mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0071.mp3|and it didn't really matter about me anyway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0072.mp3|i never go anywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0073.mp3|but you're going now aunt lucretia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0074.mp3|said he|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0075.mp3|and it does matter you see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0076.mp3|clothes are easily bought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0077.mp3|we'll go shopping after breakfast to morrow morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0078.mp3|but i really can't afford it donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0079.mp3|said his aunt with an air of finality|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0080.mp3|you know i'm not rich|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0082.mp3|i shouldn't know how to make two ends meet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0084.mp3|we'll go shopping to morrow morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0085.mp3|i've got some money in my pocket i'm just aching to spend|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0088.mp3|i struck gold up there in the klondike|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0089.mp3|and i've got more money than i know what to do with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0090.mp3|said aunt crete with awe in her voice at the thought of having more money than one knew what to do with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0091.mp3|then shyly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0092.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0093.mp3|but what aunt lucretia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0096.mp3|why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0097.mp3|there's lots of canning and house cleaning that has got to be done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0099.mp3|and run away on a pleasure excursion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0100.mp3|righteous indignation filled the heart of the nephew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0101.mp3|well i should like to know why she wouldn't like it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0102.mp3|he exclaimed impulsively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0103.mp3|has she any better right to have a vacation than you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0104.mp3|i'm sure you've earned it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0107.mp3|in spite of yourself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0108.mp3|just put your conscience away in pink cotton till we get back though i don't know whether i shall let you come back to stay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0109.mp3|i may spirit you off with me somewhere if i don't like the looks of my cousin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0110.mp3|i'll take all the responsibility of this trip|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0112.mp3|she may visit her wrath on me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0113.mp3|and i'll tell her just what i think of her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0114.mp3|anyhow to the shore you are going right speedily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0115.mp3|that is if you want to go|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0119.mp3|i want you to have a good time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0120.mp3|aunt crete gasped with joy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0121.mp3|the thought of the ocean the real ocean was wonderful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0122.mp3|she had dreamed of it many times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0123.mp3|but never had seen it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0124.mp3|because she was always the one who could just as well stay at home as not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0125.mp3|she never got run down or nervous or cross|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0126.mp3|and was ordered to go away for her health|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0128.mp3|her heart was bounding as it had not bounded since the morning of the last sunday school picnic she had attended when she was a girl|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0140.mp3|and don't have to be sewing on buttons all the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0141.mp3|laughed donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0142.mp3|as if he was enjoying the whole thing as much as his aunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0143.mp3|i meant to have a good time getting presents for the whole family|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0145.mp3|you're not to say a word|3

hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0154.mp3|then we'll get a trunk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0157.mp3|that would be a foolish expense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0160.mp3|i sha'n't need much for a few days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0161.mp3|enlarge your scale of things aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0162.mp3|you're going to stay more than a few days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0163.mp3|you're going to stay till you're tired and just want to come back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0166.mp3|we can't think of shawl straps and boxes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0167.mp3|you shall have a good big trunk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0170.mp3|we'll see if we can find one to suit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0173.mp3|it doesn't seem as if it was i i can't make it true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0174.mp3|now let's write down a list of things you need|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0175.mp3|said the eager planner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0176.mp3|we'll have to hurry up things and get off this week if possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0177.mp3|i've been reading the paper and they say there's coming a hot wave|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0179.mp3|come what shall i put down first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0181.mp3|don't you need some silk dresses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0183.mp3|hear him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0185.mp3|of course i've always had a sort of hankering after one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0186.mp3|but nothing looks very well on me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0187.mp3|carrie says my figure is dumpy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0188.mp3|i guess if you're a mind to you can get me a lace collar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0189.mp3|it'll please me as well as anything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0191.mp3|she bought one for herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0195.mp3|can't i make you understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0196.mp3|i mean business and no collars for a quarter are going to do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0197.mp3|you can have a few cheap ones for morning if you want them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0198.mp3|but we'll buy some real lace ones to wear with the pin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0199.mp3|and you shall have the silk dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0200.mp3|two or three of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0201.mp3|and a lot of other things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0202.mp3|what kind do you want|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0204.mp3|you just take my breath away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0206.mp3|the idea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0208.mp3|she always tells me i'm too gay for my years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0209.mp3|donald set his lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0210.mp3|and wished he could have speech for a few minutes with the absent luella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0211.mp3|he felt that he would like to express his contempt for her treatment of their aunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0212.mp3|i've always thought i'd like a gray silk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0213.mp3|mused aunt crete with a dreamy look in her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0215.mp3|i suppose black would be better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0217.mp3|we'll have both|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0218.mp3|said donald decidedly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0219.mp3|i saw a woman in a silver gray silk once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0220.mp3|she had white hair like yours and the effect was beautiful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0221.mp3|then you'll need some other things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0222.mp3|white dresses i guess|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0223.mp3|that's what my chum's grandmother used to wear when i went there visiting in the summer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0224.mp3|white for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0225.mp3|exclaimed the aunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0227.mp3|she says it's too conspicuous for old women to dress in light colors|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0229.mp3|we're doing this and whatever we want goes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0231.mp3|aunt crete was all in a flutter that night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0232.mp3|she could hardly sleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0233.mp3|she did not often go to town|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0234.mp3|luella did all the shopping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0235.mp3|sometimes she suggested going|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0236.mp3|but carrie always said it was a needless expense|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0240.mp3|it was a great delight to go with donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0241.mp3|her face shone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0242.mp3|and all the weariness of the day's work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0244.mp3|disappeared from her brow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0245.mp3|she looked over her meagre wardrobe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0247.mp3|and wrote down in a cramped hand a few absolute necessities|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0248.mp3|the next morning they had an early breakfast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0249.mp3|and started at once on their shopping expedition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0251.mp3|the idea of getting a lot of new clothes all for herself seemed too serious a business to be true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0252.mp3|she was dazed when she thought of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0254.mp3|when donald asked what they should look at first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0255.mp3|she showed plainly that she would be little help in getting herself fitted out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0256.mp3|she was far too happy to bring her mind down to practical things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0260.mp3|here are some collars|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0261.mp3|said donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0262.mp3|we might as well begin on those|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0263.mp3|aunt crete examined them with enthusiasm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0264.mp3|and finally picked out two at twenty five cents apiece|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0265.mp3|are those the best you have|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0266.mp3|questioned donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0268.mp3|said the saleswoman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0269.mp3|quick to identify the purchaser that did not stop at price|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0270.mp3|did you want real or imitation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0271.mp3|real by all means|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0272.mp3|he answered promptly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0274.mp3|breathed aunt crete in a warning whisper|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0275.mp3|real lace comes dreadful high|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0277.mp3|besides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0278.mp3|i shouldn't have anything to wear it with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0279.mp3|nor any place to go fixed up like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0281.mp3|he asked her with a twinkle in his eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0282.mp3|and what about the gray silk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0283.mp3|won't it go with that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0284.mp3|if not we'll get something better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0285.mp3|assisted by the saleswoman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0286.mp3|they selected two beautiful collars of real lace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0288.mp3|couldn't you go with us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0289.mp3|asked donald of the saleswoman as the purchase was concluded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0290.mp3|my aunt wishes to get a good many things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0291.mp3|and neither she nor i is much used to shopping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0292.mp3|we'd like to have your advice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0293.mp3|i'm sorry i'd like to but i'm not allowed to leave this counter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0294.mp3|said the woman with a kindly smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0295.mp3|i'm head of this department|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0296.mp3|and they can't get along without me this morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0297.mp3|but they have buyers in the office just for that purpose|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0298.mp3|you go up to the desk over on the east side just beyond the rotunda|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0299.mp3|and ask for a buyer to go around with you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0300.mp3|get miss brower if you can|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0301.mp3|and tell her the head of the lace department told you to call for her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0302.mp3|she'll tell you just what to get|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0303.mp3|and she smiled again at aunt crete's kindly beaming face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0304.mp3|they went to the desk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0305.mp3|and found miss brower|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0307.mp3|when she heard the message|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0308.mp3|took them smilingly under her wing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0309.mp3|she knew that meant a good sale had been made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0310.mp3|and there would be something in it for her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0311.mp3|besides|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0312.mp3|she had a kindly disposition|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0314.mp3|now just what do you want first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0315.mp3|she asked brightly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0317.mp3|said donald helplessly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0318.mp3|we've only bought a lace collar so far|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0319.mp3|and now we want all the rest of the things to go with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0320.mp3|the only things we've decided on so far are two silk dresses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0323.mp3|do they have them ready made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0324.mp3|nothing that would be quite suitable i'm afraid in silks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0326.mp3|said the assistant with skilful eye|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0329.mp3|lovely white hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0335.mp3|i saw one this morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0336.mp3|very simple and elegant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0337.mp3|lined with gray silk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0338.mp3|and trimmed with lace dyed to match|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0340.mp3|and just reduced this morning to thirty dollars from sixty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0341.mp3|i believe it will fit her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0342.mp3|aunt crete gasped at the price and looked at donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0343.mp3|but he seemed pleased and said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0344.mp3|that sounds good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0345.mp3|let's go and see it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0347.mp3|remember that name aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0349.mp3|but we want the silk too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0350.mp3|do they make things here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0351.mp3|we want to go away in a few days and would like to take them with us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0353.mp3|and this time of year we're not so busy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0355.mp3|and have it done in a couple of days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0356.mp3|or it could be forwarded to you if it was not quite finished when you left|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0357.mp3|they stepped into the elevator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0358.mp3|and in a trice were ushered into the presence of the rare and the imported|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0359.mp3|aunt crete stood in a maze of delight and wonder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0360.mp3|all this was on exhibition just for her benefit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0361.mp3|and she was alice in wonderland for the hour|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0362.mp3|donald stood back with his arms folded|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0363.mp3|and watched her with satisfaction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0364.mp3|one thing alone was wanted to complete it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0365.mp3|he would have liked to have luella up in the gallery somewhere watching also|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0366.mp3|but that he held in anticipation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0368.mp3|patient soul|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0370.mp3|donald recognized it as the thing many women of his acquaintance wore at the receptions he had attended in university circles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0372.mp3|and had her inward doubts whether anything so frail and lovely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0373.mp3|like a delicate veil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0374.mp3|would wear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0375.mp3|but looking at donald's happy face she decided not to mention it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0376.mp3|the dress was more beautiful than anything she had ever dreamed of possessing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0377.mp3|but it won't fit me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0385.mp3|said miss brower convincingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0386.mp3|and then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0387.mp3|with a glance at the ample waist|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0388.mp3|whose old fashioned lines lay meekly awry as if they were used to being put on that way and were beyond even discouragement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0390.mp3|there's a new one on sale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0391.mp3|has soft bones all around|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0392.mp3|and is real comfortable|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0394.mp3|if you like i'll go get one and you can be fitted over it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0395.mp3|you don't like anything very tight do you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0398.mp3|i never could bear anything real tight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0399.mp3|that's what puts luella out so about me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0402.mp3|i should be so obliged if you'd get it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0403.mp3|i'd be willing to pay any price not to look so dumpy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0405.mp3|and made all her relatives angry with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0406.mp3|she must have something to fit her once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0409.mp3|went away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0413.mp3|he would have been fully repaid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0418.mp3|could mortal attain higher in this mundane sphere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0419.mp3|when the fitting was pronounced done and aunt crete was about to don her discouraged shirt waist once more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0420.mp3|miss brower appeared in the doorway with a coat and skirt suit over her arm|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0422.mp3|just put this on and let the gentleman see how he likes it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0423.mp3|she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0424.mp3|she had been out to talk over matters with donald and have an understanding as to what was wanted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0426.mp3|with an extra cloth coat for cool days|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0428.mp3|with the new dignity that consciousness of her improved figure gave her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0429.mp3|rustled out to her nephew looking like a new woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0430.mp3|her face beaming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0431.mp3|that was a wonderful day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0433.mp3|and yet again for a black and white dotted swiss|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0434.mp3|and a white linen suit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0436.mp3|and then to have the measure taken for the silver gray silk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0437.mp3|which the head dressmaker promised could be hurried through|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0439.mp3|dreamy white shirt waists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0440.mp3|simple and plain in design|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0441.mp3|with exquisite lace simply applied|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0443.mp3|and finer material|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0444.mp3|miss brower advised white linen and white lawn for morning wear at the seashore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0445.mp3|and gave aunt crete confidence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0446.mp3|telling how she had a customer|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0447.mp3|a woman about as old as you with just such lovely white hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0448.mp3|who but yesterday purchased a set of white dresses for morning wear at the seashore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0449.mp3|this silenced the thoughts of her sister's horror at|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0451.mp3|what are you thinking of|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0452.mp3|never mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0453.mp3|she was going to have one good time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0454.mp3|even if she had to put all her lovely finery away in a trunk afterwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0455.mp3|and never bring it out again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0456.mp3|or dreary thought were made to cut it over for luella sometime|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0458.mp3|it might come to that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0459.mp3|but at least she would enjoy it while it was hers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0460.mp3|two white linen skirts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0461.mp3|a handsome black cloth coat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0462.mp3|several pairs of silk gloves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0463.mp3|black and white|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0464.mp3|some undergarments dainty enough for a bride|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0465.mp3|a whole dozen pairs of stockings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0466.mp3|how aunt crete rejoiced in those|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0467.mp3|she had been wearing stockings whose feet were cut out of old stocking legs for fifteen years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0468.mp3|she couldn't remember when she had had a whole new pair of stockings all her own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0469.mp3|and then two new bonnets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0470.mp3|all these things were acquired little by little|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0471.mp3|it was while they were in the millinery department|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0473.mp3|that donald decided she was one of the most beautiful old ladies he had ever seen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0474.mp3|the drapery was a fine black lace scarf|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0475.mp3|which swept around the roses and tied loosely on the breast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0476.mp3|and it gave the quiet little woman a queenly air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0477.mp3|she was getting used to seeing her own face in strange adornments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0478.mp3|but it startled her to see that she really looked handsome in this bonnet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0479.mp3|she stood before the transformation in the mirror almost in awe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0480.mp3|and never heard what miss brower was saying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0481.mp3|that's just the thing for best|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0482.mp3|and there's a lovely lace wrap in the cloak department she ought to have to go with it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0483.mp3|it would be charming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0484.mp3|get it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0485.mp3|said donald with respectful brevity|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0486.mp3|he was astonished himself at the difference mere clothes made|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0487.mp3|aunt crete was fairly impressive in her new bonnet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0488.mp3|and the lace wrap proved indeed to be the very mate to the bonnet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0489.mp3|hiding the comfortable figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0490.mp3|and making her look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0491.mp3|just like other people|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0492.mp3|as she breathlessly expressed it after one glance at herself in the lace wrap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0493.mp3|they bought a plain black bonnet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0494.mp3|a sweet little gray one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0495.mp3|a fine silk umbrella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0496.mp3|a lot of pretty belts and handkerchiefs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0497.mp3|some shoes and rubbers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0498.mp3|a hand bag of cut steel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0501.mp3|and left her for a little while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0502.mp3|and went to lunch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0503.mp3|such a lunch|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0505.mp3|and fish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0506.mp3|and spring lamb|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0507.mp3|and fresh peas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0508.mp3|and new potatoes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0510.mp3|aunt crete's hand trembled as she took the first spoonful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0511.mp3|the wonders of the day had been so great that she was fairly worn out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0512.mp3|and two little bright red spots of excitement had appeared in her cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0513.mp3|but she was happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0514.mp3|happier than she remembered ever to have been in her life before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0515.mp3|her dear old conscience had a moment of sighing that luella could not have been there to have enjoyed it too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0517.mp3|they went into a great hall in the same store|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0518.mp3|and sat among the palms and coolness made by electric fans|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0519.mp3|while a wonderful organ played exquisite music|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0520.mp3|and aunt crete felt she certainly was in heaven without the trouble of dying|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0521.mp3|and she never dreamed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0523.mp3|that she had been dying all her life that others might live|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0524.mp3|and that it is to such that the reward is promised|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0525.mp3|they went back to miss brower later and behold|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0526.mp3|the silver gray silk had been cut out and was ready to fit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0527.mp3|aunt crete felt it was fairy work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0528.mp3|the whole of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0529.mp3|and she touched the fabric as if it had been made by magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0530.mp3|then they went and bought a trunk and a handsome leather satchel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0531.mp3|and donald took a notion that his aunt must have a set of silver combs for her hair such as he saw in the hair of another old lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0533.mp3|said donald reflectively|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0534.mp3|we'll go home and get rested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0535.mp3|and to morrow we'll come down and buy any things we've forgotten|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0536.mp3|and i'm sure i don't see what more a body could possibly need|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0537.mp3|said aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0539.mp3|tired and absolutely contented|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0540.mp3|she climbed into the train and sat down in the hot plush seat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0541.mp3|the one bitter drop in the cup of bliss came the next morning or rather two drops in the shape of letters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0543.mp3|in which she professed to have just heard of his coming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0544.mp3|and to be exceedingly sorry that she was not at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0545.mp3|and was kept from returning only by a sprained ankle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0546.mp3|the doctor telling her that she must not put her foot to the ground for two or three weeks yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0547.mp3|or she would have to suffer for it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0548.mp3|the other letter was for aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0549.mp3|and was a rehash of the telephone message|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0550.mp3|with a good sound scolding for having gone away from the telephone before she finished speaking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0551.mp3|luella had written it herself because she felt like venting her temper on some one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0552.mp3|the young man that had been so attentive to her in town had promenaded the piazza with another young woman all the evening before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0554.mp3|aunt crete put on her double v as she read|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0555.mp3|and sighed for a full minute before donald looked up amused from his letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0556.mp3|now aunt crete you look as if a mountain had rolled down upon you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0557.mp3|what's the matter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0561.mp3|when carrie expects me to do all this canning and sewing and cleaning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0562.mp3|i'm afraid she'll never forgive me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0563.mp3|now aunt crete don't you love me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0564.mp3|didn't i tell you i'd stand between you and the whole world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0565.mp3|please put that letter up and come and help me pack your new trunk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0567.mp3|or shall i put the shoes at the bottom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0568.mp3|don't you know you and i are going to have the time of our lives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0569.mp3|we're going to run away from every care|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0571.mp3|come forget it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0572.mp3|cut it out aunt crete and let's pack the trunk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0573.mp3|i'm longing to be off to smell the briny deep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0574.mp3|and laughingly he carried her away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0575.mp3|and plunged her into thoughts of her journey|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_03_hill_0576.mp3|giving her no time the rest of the day to think of anything else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0002.mp3|and the front door looked reproachfully at aunt crete as she turned the key carefully and tried it twice to be sure it was locked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0004.mp3|she felt it had hardly been right to put on a new black silk in the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0005.mp3|and go off from all the cares of the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0006.mp3|just leave them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0007.mp3|boldly ignore them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0008.mp3|like any giddy girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0009.mp3|and take a vacation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0010.mp3|she regarded herself with awe and a rising self respect in every window she passed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0011.mp3|somehow the look of dumpiness had passed away mysteriously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0013.mp3|while donald carried her new satchel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0014.mp3|and her new trunk bumped on a square ahead in the expressman's wagon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0015.mp3|it was a hot morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0016.mp3|and the great city station seemed close and stuffy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0017.mp3|but aunt crete mingled with the steaming crowd blissfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0018.mp3|to be one with the world attired irreproachably|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0019.mp3|to be on her way to a great hotel by the sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0020.mp3|with new clothes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0021.mp3|and escorted devotedly by some one that was her very own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0022.mp3|this indeed was happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0023.mp3|could any one desire more upon the earth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0024.mp3|donald put her into a cab at the station|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0025.mp3|and she beamed happily out at the frightful streets that always made her heart come into her mouth on the rare occasions when she had to cross them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0026.mp3|the ride across the city seemed a brief and distinguished experience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0027.mp3|it was as if everybody else was walking and they only had the grandeur of a carriage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0028.mp3|then the ferry boat was delightful to the new traveller|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0031.mp3|and its smell of wet timbers and tarred ropes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0032.mp3|they had a seat close to the front|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0033.mp3|where they could look out and watch their own progress and see the many puffing monsters laboriously plying back and forth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0034.mp3|and the horizon line of many masts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0035.mp3|like fine brown lines against the sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0036.mp3|aunt crete felt that at last she was out in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0037.mp3|she could not have felt it more if she had been starting for europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0038.mp3|the seashore train|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0039.mp3|with its bamboo seats and its excited groups of children bearing tin pails and shovels and tennis rackets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0040.mp3|filled her with a fine exhilaration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0043.mp3|her soul had escaped the bounds of red brick walls that she had expected would surround her as long as she lived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0044.mp3|she drew deep breaths|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0046.mp3|yelling baby and all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0047.mp3|she gazed and gazed at the fast flying jersey scenery|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0049.mp3|and admired every little white and green town at which they paused|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0050.mp3|donald put her into a carriage when they reached the shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0051.mp3|half an hour off they had begun to smell the sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0052.mp3|and to catch glimpses of low lying marshes and a misty blueness against the sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0056.mp3|and a white speckled horse|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0061.mp3|and enjoyed the creak of her silk jacket as she settled into place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0062.mp3|she felt as if this was a play that would soon be over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0063.mp3|but she would enjoy it to the very end|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0064.mp3|and then go back to her dish washing and cellar cleaning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0065.mp3|and being blamed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0066.mp3|and bear them all in happy remembrance of what she had had for one blissful vacation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0068.mp3|she was engaged in watching for the first blue line of the great mysterious ocean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0069.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0070.mp3|when it came into sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0072.mp3|her heart stood still for one moment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0073.mp3|and then bounded onward set to the time of wonder|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0075.mp3|the hand baggage drifted up the steps as if by magic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0076.mp3|and awaited them in the apartments to which they arose in a luxurious elevator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0078.mp3|sitting in a row of large rocking chairs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0079.mp3|as she glided up to the second floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0080.mp3|it gave her rest on one point for they all wore white dresses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0081.mp3|she had been a little dubious about those white dresses that donald had insisted upon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0082.mp3|but now she might enjoy them unashamed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0084.mp3|she glanced around the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0085.mp3|half fearfully expecting to find luella waiting there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0090.mp3|luella might not like it after all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0091.mp3|dreadful thought|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0092.mp3|and after donald had taken so much trouble and spent so much money all to surprise them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0094.mp3|and went his way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0095.mp3|aunt crete and donald were left alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0096.mp3|they looked at each other and smiled|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0097.mp3|let's look around and see where they've put us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0098.mp3|said donald pushing the swaying curtains aside|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0099.mp3|and there before them rolled the blue tide of the ocean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0100.mp3|aunt crete sank into a chair and was silent for a while|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0101.mp3|and then she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0102.mp3|it's just as big as i thought it would be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0103.mp3|i was so afraid it wouldn't be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0104.mp3|some folks next door went down to the shore last year|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0105.mp3|and they said it didn't look big enough to what they'd expected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0106.mp3|and i've been afraid ever since|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0107.mp3|donald's eyes filled with a tender light that was beautiful to see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0108.mp3|he was enjoying the spending of his money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0109.mp3|and it was yielding him a rich reward already|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0111.mp3|donald discovered a few moments later|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0112.mp3|when he went down to the office to investigate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0113.mp3|that luella and his aunt occupied a single room on the fourth floor back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0114.mp3|overlooking the kitchen court|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0115.mp3|it was not where he would have placed them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0116.mp3|had they chosen to await his coming and be taken down to the shore in style|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0117.mp3|but now that they had run away from him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0118.mp3|and were too evidently ashamed of him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0119.mp3|perhaps it was as well to let them remain where they were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0120.mp3|he reflected|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0122.mp3|announced donald when he came up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0124.mp3|well that's real nice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0125.mp3|exclaimed aunt crete with a smile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0126.mp3|turning from her view of the sea|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0127.mp3|where she had been ever since he left her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0130.mp3|donald smiled approvingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0131.mp3|he was not altogether sure he cared to meet that other aunt and cousin at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0133.mp3|and carry aunt crete with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0135.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0136.mp3|i'm glad you're not disappointed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0137.mp3|we'll do just whatever we want to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0138.mp3|would you like to go in bathing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0141.mp3|i've always thought i'd like to see how it would feel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0142.mp3|but i guess i'm too old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0144.mp3|it wouldn't look nice in a bathing suit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0145.mp3|luella wouldn't like it a bit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0148.mp3|she always makes a lot of fun of old people going in and sitting right on the edge of the water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0149.mp3|i guess it won't do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0150.mp3|yes it will do if you want to|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0151.mp3|didn't i tell you this was my party and luella isn't in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0152.mp3|that's ridiculous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0154.mp3|and you sha'n't be scared either|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0155.mp3|i can swim like a fish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0156.mp3|you shall go in every day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0157.mp3|would you like to begin at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0158.mp3|i should|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0159.mp3|said aunt crete rising with a look of resolution in her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0161.mp3|so if she was to dare it it must be done before her niece appeared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0162.mp3|they went down to the beach|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0163.mp3|and for a few minutes surveyed the bathers as they came out to the water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0165.mp3|arrayed herself in the gay blue flannel garb provided for her use|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0166.mp3|and came timidly out to meet donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0167.mp3|tall and smiling in his blue jerseys|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0168.mp3|they had a wonderful time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0169.mp3|it was almost better than shopping|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0170.mp3|donald led her down to the water|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0171.mp3|and very gently accustomed her to it until he had led her out beyond the roughness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0172.mp3|where his strong arms lifted her well above the swells until she felt as if she was a bird|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0173.mp3|it was marvellous that she was not afraid but she was not|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0174.mp3|it was as if she had that morning been transferred back over forty years to her youth again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0175.mp3|and was having the good times that she had longed for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0176.mp3|such as other girls had the swings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0179.mp3|and bicyclings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0180.mp3|how many such things she had watched through the years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0181.mp3|with her heart palpitating with daring to do it all herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0184.mp3|they would have taken it out of her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0186.mp3|the white hair with its natural waves fluffed out beautifully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0189.mp3|and aunt crete was smiling and charming at lunch in one of her fine new white dresses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0190.mp3|she had hurried to put it on before luella appeared|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0193.mp3|and that that would probably be their final destination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0194.mp3|just as luella's discarded garments came to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0195.mp3|but there was nothing to mar the lunch time and the beautiful afternoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0197.mp3|after a delicious nap to the accompaniment of the music of the waves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0198.mp3|she was taken to drive in the fringed carriage again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0199.mp3|while a bunch of handsome ladies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0200.mp3|old and young|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0202.mp3|and watched her approvingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0203.mp3|she felt that she was of some importance in their eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0204.mp3|she had suddenly blossomed out of her insignificance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0205.mp3|and was worth looking at|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0206.mp3|it warmed her heart with humble pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0207.mp3|she felt that she had won approval|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0208.mp3|not through any merit of her own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0209.mp3|but through donald's loving kindness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0210.mp3|it was wonderful what a charm clothes could work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0214.mp3|i think i ought to keep that for parties don't you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0215.mp3|if ever there was a party it's going to be to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0216.mp3|said donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0217.mp3|it's going to be a surprise party|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0219.mp3|so with trembling fingers aunt crete arrayed herself in her purple and fine linen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0220.mp3|very materially assisted by a quiet maid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0222.mp3|and who persuaded aunt crete to let her arrange the pretty white hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0223.mp3|it was surprising to see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0225.mp3|that she looked quite like the other old ladies|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0226.mp3|who were not old at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0227.mp3|only playing old|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0228.mp3|i don't believe they will know me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0229.mp3|whispered aunt crete to herself as she stood before the full length mirror and surveyed the effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0230.mp3|and i didn't think i could ever look like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0231.mp3|she murmured after a more prolonged gaze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0232.mp3|during which she made the acquaintance of her new self|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0233.mp3|then she added half wistfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0234.mp3|i wish i had known it before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0236.mp3|she sighed half regretfully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0238.mp3|and went out to donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0239.mp3|who awaited her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0240.mp3|she felt that the picnic part of her vacation was almost over now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0242.mp3|donald looked up from his paper with a welcome in his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0244.mp3|and she thought him handsome as a king|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0245.mp3|you're a very beautiful woman aunt crete do you know it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0246.mp3|said donald with satisfaction|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0247.mp3|he had felt that the french maid would know how to put just the right touch to aunt crete's pretty hair to take away her odd|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0250.mp3|now she was completely in the fashion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0251.mp3|and she looked every inch a lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0252.mp3|she somehow seemed to have natural intuition for gentle manners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0254.mp3|for surely there can be no better manners than come wrapped up with the golden rule|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0255.mp3|and aunt crete had lived by that all her life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0256.mp3|they entered the great dining hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0257.mp3|and made their way among the palms in a blaze of electric light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0258.mp3|with the head waiter bowing obsequiously before them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0259.mp3|they had a table to themselves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0261.mp3|and lifted the handsome napkins and silver forks with awe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0262.mp3|sometimes it seemed as if she were still dreaming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0263.mp3|the party from pleasure bay had reached home rather late in the afternoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0264.mp3|after a tedious time in the hot sun at a place full of peanut stands and merry go rounds and moving picture shows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0265.mp3|luella had not had a good time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0266.mp3|she had been disappointed that none of the young men in the party had paid her special attention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0267.mp3|in fact|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0268.mp3|the special young man for whose sake she had prodded her mother into going had not accompanied them at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0269.mp3|luella was thoroughly cross|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0271.mp3|said her mother sharply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0272.mp3|it's so unbecoming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0273.mp3|the skin is all peeling off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0274.mp3|i do wish you'd wear a veil|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0275.mp3|you can't afford to lose your complexion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0276.mp3|with such a figure as you have|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0278.mp3|i wish you'd let up on that ma|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0280.mp3|didn't you get a letter from aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0282.mp3|i wanted to wear it to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0284.mp3|she ought to have got it done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0285.mp3|she's had time enough since i telephoned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0286.mp3|i suppose she's gone to reading again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0287.mp3|i do wish i'd remembered to lock up the bookcase|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0288.mp3|she's crazy for novels|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0289.mp3|all this time luella was being buttoned into a pink silk muslin heavily decorated with cheap lace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0290.mp3|there were twenty six tiny elusive buttons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0291.mp3|and luella's mother was tired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0292.mp3|what on earth makes you so long ma|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0294.mp3|we'll be so late we won't get served and i'm hungry as a bear|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0295.mp3|they hurried down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0296.mp3|arriving at the door just as aunt crete and donald were being settled into their chairs by the smiling head waiter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0298.mp3|those must be swells|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0301.mp3|he never does that to us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0302.mp3|i expect he got a big tip|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0304.mp3|goodness ma your hair is all slipped to one side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0305.mp3|put it up quick|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0306.mp3|no the other side|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0307.mp3|say he's an awfully handsome young man|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0308.mp3|i wonder if we can get introduced|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0309.mp3|i just know he dances gracefully|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0310.mp3|say mother i'd like to get him for a partner to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0311.mp3|i guess those stuck up grandons would open their eyes then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0313.mp3|they settled into their places unassisted by the dilatory waiter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0314.mp3|who came languidly up a moment later to take their order|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0315.mp3|aunt crete's back was happily toward her relatives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0317.mp3|the palms were all about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0318.mp3|and the gentle clink of silver and glass|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0319.mp3|and refined voices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0320.mp3|the soft strains of an orchestra hidden in a balcony of ferns and palms drowned luella's strident voice when it was raised in discontented strain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0321.mp3|and so aunt crete failed to recognize the sound|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0324.mp3|he had asked a question or two|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0325.mp3|and knew about where his relatives usually sat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0326.mp3|and had purposely asked to be placed near them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0327.mp3|he studied luella when she came in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0328.mp3|and felt pretty sure she was the girl he had seen on the platform of the train the morning he arrived in midvale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0331.mp3|from the lips of the sour woman in the purple satin with white question marks all over it and plasters of white lace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0332.mp3|aunt carrie was tall and thin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0333.mp3|with a discontented droop to her lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0335.mp3|she wore an affected air of abnormal politeness and disapproval of everything|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0337.mp3|and that exquisite real lace collar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0338.mp3|to remind her of poor sister lucretia|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0339.mp3|she always coupled the adjective|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0341.mp3|with her sister's name when she thought of all her shortcomings|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0342.mp3|luella's discontent was somewhat enlivened by the sight of the young man that had not gone on the drive to pleasure bay|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0343.mp3|he stood in the doorway searching the room with keen interested eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0344.mp3|could it be that he was looking for her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0346.mp3|yes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0347.mp3|he seemed to be looking that way as if he had found the object of his search|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0348.mp3|and he was surely coming down toward them with a real smile on his face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0350.mp3|she would be very coy and pretend not to see him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0351.mp3|so she began a voluble and animated conversation with her mother about the charming time they had had that day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0352.mp3|which might have surprised the worthy woman if she had not been accustomed to her daughter's wiles|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0354.mp3|the young man came on straight by the solicitous waiters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0355.mp3|who waved him frantically to various tables|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0356.mp3|luella cast a rapid side glance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0358.mp3|her mother looked up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0360.mp3|to see what was the cause of luella's animation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0362.mp3|the girl felt excited thrills creeping up her back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0363.mp3|and the color rushed into her cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0364.mp3|which were already red enough from the wind and sun of the day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0365.mp3|well well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0367.mp3|this is too good to be true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0368.mp3|don old man where did you drop from|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0373.mp3|i thought you were in europe bless your heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0374.mp3|this is the best thing that could have happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0375.mp3|let me introduce my aunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0376.mp3|some seconds before this luella's thrills had changed to chills|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0377.mp3|mortification stole over her face and up to the roots of her hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0378.mp3|even the back of her neck|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0379.mp3|where her bathing suit was cut low and square|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0380.mp3|turned angry looking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0383.mp3|but luella had the presence of mind to smile on to her mother in mild pretence that she had but just noticed the advent of the young man behind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0384.mp3|an obsequious waiter was bringing an extra chair for mister grandon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0386.mp3|perhaps he would recognize her yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0387.mp3|and there might be a chance of introduction to the handsome stranger|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0388.mp3|luella dallied with her dinner in fond hope|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0391.mp3|they could not see her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0392.mp3|they could only notice how interested both the young men were in her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0393.mp3|and how courteous they were to her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0394.mp3|and they decided she must be some very great personage indeed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0395.mp3|they watched her half enviously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0396.mp3|and began to plan some way to scrape an acquaintance with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0397.mp3|one glimpse they had of her face as the head waiter rushed to draw back her chair when she had finished her dinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0399.mp3|handsome face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0400.mp3|younger than they had expected to see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0401.mp3|with beautiful sparkling eyes full of mirth and contentment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0402.mp3|what was there in the face that reminded them of something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0403.mp3|had they ever met that old lady before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0405.mp3|and followed hard upon the footsteps of the three down the length of the dining hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0407.mp3|and disconsolately they lingered about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0408.mp3|looking up and down the length of piazzas in vain hope to see them sitting in one of the great rows of rockers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0409.mp3|watching the many tinted waves in the dying evening light|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0410.mp3|but there was no sign of them anywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0411.mp3|as they stood thus leaning over the balcony|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0412.mp3|a large automobile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0414.mp3|with white cushions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0415.mp3|like a great gliding dove|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0416.mp3|slipped silently up to the entrance below them in the well bred silence that an expensive machine knows how to assume under dignified owners|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0417.mp3|luella twitched her mother's sleeve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0418.mp3|that's grandon's car|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0419.mp3|she whispered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0421.mp3|let's sit down here and wait|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_04_hill_0422.mp3|the mother obediently sat down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0000.mp3|luella and her mother are mystified they had not long to wait|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0001.mp3|they heard the elevator door slide softly open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0002.mp3|and then the gentle swish of silken skirts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0005.mp3|he would not be likely to ask another one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0006.mp3|the young man and the gray silk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0011.mp3|they did not look around at the people on the piazza at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0014.mp3|whispered her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0015.mp3|they might look up yet and see you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0016.mp3|this warning came just in time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0017.mp3|for young mister grandon just as he was about to start the car glanced up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0018.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0019.mp3|catching luella's fixed gaze|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0020.mp3|gave her a distant bow|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0021.mp3|which was followed by a courteous lifting of the stranger's hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0024.mp3|she was secretly exulting that luella and carrie had not been in evidence yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0025.mp3|she felt that her joy was being lengthened by a few minutes more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0026.mp3|for she could not get away from the fear that her sister and niece would spoil it all as soon as they appeared upon the scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0028.mp3|and we wouldn't disturb them to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0029.mp3|said donald in a low tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0032.mp3|and raised her eyes with a relieved glance toward the rows of people on the piazza|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0034.mp3|but evidently they had not got back yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0035.mp3|or perhaps had not finished their dinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0036.mp3|as aunt crete raised her eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0037.mp3|luella and her mother looked down into her upturned face enviously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0039.mp3|fluffy hair like her own|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0041.mp3|in deep satisfaction aunt crete reflected that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0043.mp3|she would cite this model|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0044.mp3|who was evidently an old aristocrat if one might judge by her jewels and her general make up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0045.mp3|somewhere i've seen that woman with the gray silk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0048.mp3|look at the way she raises her hand to her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0049.mp3|my land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0050.mp3|i believe she reminds me of your aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0051.mp3|now mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0053.mp3|as if aunt crete could ever look like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0055.mp3|why ma this woman is the real thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0056.mp3|just see how her hair's put up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0057.mp3|nobody but a french maid could get it like that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0058.mp3|imagine aunt crete with a french maid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0064.mp3|did you notice how graceful that handsome stranger was when he handed the ladies into the car|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0065.mp3|my but i'd like to know him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0066.mp3|i think clarence grandon is just a stuck up prig|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0067.mp3|her mother looked at her sharply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0068.mp3|luella seems to me you change your mind a good deal|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0070.mp3|what's made you change your mind|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0071.mp3|he doesn't seem to go with any other girls|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0072.mp3|no he just sticks by his mother every living minute|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0075.mp3|i look better in that than anything else i've got|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0076.mp3|i declare i think aunt crete is real mean and selfish not to send it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0077.mp3|i'm going in to see if the mail has come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0078.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0081.mp3|i'm going to call her up on the telephone again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0082.mp3|luella vanished into the hotel office|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0083.mp3|and her mother sat and rocked with puckered brows|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0085.mp3|but how to attain it was the problem|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0086.mp3|she had not been born for social climbing and took hardly to it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0087.mp3|meantime the motor car rolled smoothly over the perfect roads|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0088.mp3|keeping always that wonderful gleaming sea in sight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0090.mp3|serenely happy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0095.mp3|as in a dream she heard the kindly tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0096.mp3|and responded mechanically to the questions about her journey and the weather in the city|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0097.mp3|and how lovely the sea was to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0098.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0099.mp3|as she spoke the few words with her lips|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0100.mp3|her soul was singing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0101.mp3|and the words of its song were these|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0102.mp3|must i be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0103.mp3|while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0104.mp3|and it seemed to her as they glided along the palace lined shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0106.mp3|and the beautiful people in their beautiful raiment at ease and happy on the other hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0107.mp3|that she was picked right up out of the hot little brick house in the narrow street|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0108.mp3|and put on a wonderfully flowery bed of ease|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0109.mp3|and was floating right into a heaven of which her precious donald was a bright|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0110.mp3|particular angel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0112.mp3|and just enjoyed herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0115.mp3|and her heart warmed to the other woman as she saw that she was really interested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0116.mp3|she had never supposed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0118.mp3|that they would even deign to eat such a common thing as a pickle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0119.mp3|let alone knowing anything about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0123.mp3|common lady like any one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0124.mp3|and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0125.mp3|as she went up in the elevator beside her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0126.mp3|and said good night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0127.mp3|she felt as if she had known her all her life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0128.mp3|it was not until she had turned out her light and crept into the great hotel bed that it came to her to wonder whether luella and carrie could be meant by the ones in the hymn|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0129.mp3|while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0133.mp3|and now aunt crete was having a good time the time of her life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0134.mp3|and she hugged herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0135.mp3|she was so happy over it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0136.mp3|and thought of the dear stars out there in the deep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0137.mp3|dark blue of the arching sky|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0139.mp3|dark roll of the white tipped waves|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0140.mp3|and was thankful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0141.mp3|luella and her mother had gloomily watched the dancing through the open windows of the ballroom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0142.mp3|but as they knew no one inside they did not venture in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0144.mp3|but somehow missed it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0145.mp3|and finally retired to the solace of cold cream and the comforts of the fourth floor back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0147.mp3|as the elevator ascended past the second floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0148.mp3|the door of one of the special apartments stood wide|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0149.mp3|revealing a glimpse of the handsome young stranger standing under the chandelier reading a letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0150.mp3|his face alive with pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0151.mp3|luella sighed enviously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0153.mp3|and knew not that of her own free will she had closed the door to that very special apartment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0154.mp3|which might have been hers but for her own action|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0156.mp3|till they looked for all the world like a pan of rolls just out of the oven|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0157.mp3|she had jerked them off four separate times|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0158.mp3|and pulled the rest of her hair down twice in a vain attempt to get just the desired effect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0159.mp3|and her patience|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0160.mp3|never very great at any time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0161.mp3|was well nigh exhausted|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0162.mp3|her mother was fretting because the best pieces of fish and all the hot rolls would be gone before they got down to breakfast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0164.mp3|when a noticeable tap came on the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0165.mp3|it was not the tap of the chambermaid of the fourth floor back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0166.mp3|nor of the elevator boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0167.mp3|who knew how to modulate his knock for every grade of room from the second story|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0168.mp3|ocean front|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0169.mp3|up and back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0170.mp3|it was a knock of rare condescension|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0173.mp3|not that they were worthy of any such consideration as was about to fall upon them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0174.mp3|luella drove the last hairpin into the puffs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0175.mp3|and sprang to the door just as her mother opened it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0176.mp3|she felt something was about to happen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0179.mp3|there in the hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0180.mp3|looking very much out of place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0181.mp3|and as if he hoped his condescension would be appreciated|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0182.mp3|but he doubted it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0183.mp3|stood the uniformed functionary that usually confined his activities to the second floor front|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0184.mp3|where the tips were large and the guests of unquestioned wealth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0185.mp3|to say nothing of culture|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0186.mp3|he held in his hand a shining silver tray on which lay two cards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0187.mp3|and he delivered his message in a tone that not only showed the deference he felt for the one who had sent him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0188.mp3|but compelled such deference also on the part of those to whom he spoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0193.mp3|he bowed to signify that his mission was completed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0194.mp3|and that if it did not carry through|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0195.mp3|it was entirely beyond his sphere to do more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0196.mp3|luella grasped the cards and smothered an exclamation of delight|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0197.mp3|second floor front|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0198.mp3|gasped her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0199.mp3|the private parlor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0203.mp3|miss ward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0206.mp3|who in life are they|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0207.mp3|do you know any miss ward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0209.mp3|miss ward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0210.mp3|donald ward grant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0211.mp3|who can they be and what do you suppose they want|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0214.mp3|where have i why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0216.mp3|it can't be that dreadful cousin has followed us up can it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0219.mp3|but who is the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0224.mp3|it's your aunt crete and that dreadful cousin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0225.mp3|crete never did have any sense if she is my sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0226.mp3|but just let me get speech of her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0228.mp3|i think i'll find a way to make her understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0231.mp3|she groaned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0233.mp3|and here of all places|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0234.mp3|to come here and mortify me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0235.mp3|it is just too dreadful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0236.mp3|ma it can't be true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0237.mp3|aunt crete would never dare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0238.mp3|and where would she get the money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0240.mp3|you didn't go and leave her money did you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0242.mp3|it wouldn't have been enough to come down here on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0245.mp3|i did leave five dollars to pay the grocer bill with|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0247.mp3|still there's no telling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0250.mp3|what shall we do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0255.mp3|if we have to run away again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0256.mp3|it would never do to have those two appear here now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0259.mp3|i should simply sink through the floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0261.mp3|snapped the practical mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0262.mp3|we've paid for our room two weeks ahead|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0263.mp3|i didn't want to do that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0266.mp3|and that would settle it with her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0267.mp3|so now it's done and we can't afford not to abide by it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0268.mp3|besides what good would that do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0270.mp3|and that would be as bad as it was in the first place|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0271.mp3|we've got to think it out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0273.mp3|she'd have to think some way out of it herself without any of my help|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0275.mp3|i can't understand how she'd do it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0276.mp3|i didn't think she'd dare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0279.mp3|said her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0280.mp3|we'll slip down those stairs in the back hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0283.mp3|we'll just slip in the back door and get our breakfast right away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0284.mp3|it's getting pretty late|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0286.mp3|they've likely come up from town on that very early train|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0287.mp3|and they'll sit and wait for us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0288.mp3|we'll ring for a messenger bell boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0290.mp3|and you can't leave me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0295.mp3|and her daughter cannot leave her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0296.mp3|miss ward will have to come up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0299.mp3|and we'll send it down as quick as we get back from breakfast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0300.mp3|hurry up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0301.mp3|the only thing about it will be that climb up three flights after breakfast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0302.mp3|but it won't do for us to risk the elevator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0303.mp3|crete might recognize us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0304.mp3|for the elevator goes right by that second floor front parlor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0305.mp3|what i don't understand is how they got in there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0306.mp3|it's only rich people can afford that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0307.mp3|but land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0309.mp3|hasn't been out in the world ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0310.mp3|and very likely she never asked how much the rooms were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0311.mp3|but just took the best she could lay eyes on|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0312.mp3|or more likely it's a mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0313.mp3|and she's sitting in that little reception room down on the office floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0314.mp3|and thinks it the second floor because she came up such a long flight of steps from the sidewalk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0316.mp3|and take it to the same folks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0318.mp3|there's no telling but they might be prowling round trying to hunt us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0319.mp3|so keep a lookout|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0320.mp3|thus by devious and back ways they descended to a late breakfast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0321.mp3|and scuttled up again without being molested|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0323.mp3|and a small boy all brass buttons was despatched with careful directions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0324.mp3|and then the two retired behind their ramparts and waited|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0326.mp3|until half an hour had elapsed since they came back from breakfast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0327.mp3|they had listened anxiously to every footfall in the hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0330.mp3|when the chambermaid arrived|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0331.mp3|they were fairly feverish to get her out of the way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0333.mp3|it might get all over the hotel what kind of relatives they had|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0336.mp3|as they wanted to write some letters before going out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0337.mp3|but the maid declared she must do the room at once or not at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0338.mp3|the elevator slid up and down around the corner in the next hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0339.mp3|they heard a footfall now and then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0341.mp3|they rang again for the office boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0342.mp3|who declared he had delivered the message in the second floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0345.mp3|all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0347.mp3|and they looked at each other in anxiety and indignation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0349.mp3|i wanted to go in bathing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0350.mp3|complained luella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0351.mp3|and now no telling how long i'll have to stick in this dull room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0354.mp3|just then the elevator clanged open and shut|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0355.mp3|and steps came down the hall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0356.mp3|it certainly was not aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0358.mp3|and there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0359.mp3|submerged in a sheaf of american beauty roses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0360.mp3|stood the functionary from the lower floor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0361.mp3|with a less pompous manner than he had worn before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0364.mp3|to rise several degrees|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0366.mp3|looking first at the roses and then at the servant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0367.mp3|such roses had never come into her life before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0368.mp3|could it be must it be but a miserable mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0369.mp3|then the servant spoke|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0371.mp3|she send her regrets|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0376.mp3|and the mother and daughter faced each other over the roses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0377.mp3|bewilderment and awe in their faces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0379.mp3|who sent those roses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0380.mp3|miss ward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0381.mp3|luella there's some mistake|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0382.mp3|aunt crete couldn't have sent them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0383.mp3|she wouldn't dare|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0384.mp3|besides where would she get the money|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0385.mp3|it's perfectly impossible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0386.mp3|it can't be aunt crete after all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0387.mp3|it must be some one else with the same name|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0389.mp3|you can't tell|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0390.mp3|or perhaps it isn't our donald at all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0391.mp3|it's likely there's other donald grants in the world|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0393.mp3|and not skulk in a corner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0395.mp3|there's no telling at all who this is now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0396.mp3|it might be those folks you admired so much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0397.mp3|though what on earth they should have sent their cards to us for and those lovely roses i'm sure i don't know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0398.mp3|now ma you needn't blame me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0400.mp3|you know it was mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0401.mp3|and of course i had to do what you said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0402.mp3|i was so upset anyway i didn't know what was what|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0403.mp3|but now you see perhaps you've cut me out of a lovely day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0404.mp3|we might have gone on a ride with them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0406.mp3|her mother broke in sharply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0408.mp3|i'll take the next train back home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0409.mp3|you don't know what you are talking about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0412.mp3|and a country cousin for all you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0415.mp3|would you have wanted to go driving in the face of the whole hotel|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0417.mp3|luella was silenced for the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_05_hill_0418.mp3|and the room settled into gloomy meditation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0001.mp3|relief and joy mingled in her countenance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0002.mp3|it was not that she was glad that carrie's ankle was so bad|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0003.mp3|but that she was to have another short reprieve before her pleasure was cut off|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0006.mp3|would she be destined to sit in the darkened room and minister to her fussy sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0008.mp3|as young folks should do|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0014.mp3|who had worked hard all her life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0015.mp3|could yet have had this bit of a glimpse of the brighter side of life before she died|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0016.mp3|it would be something to sit and think over as she scraped potatoes for dinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0017.mp3|or picked over blackberries for jam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0019.mp3|it would be an event to date from|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0022.mp3|when she sat beside her some time at missionary meeting|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0023.mp3|if she ever did again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0024.mp3|when my nephew took me down to the shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0028.mp3|but here was a topic worth laying before such a great lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0029.mp3|well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0030.mp3|it was something to be thankful for|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0032.mp3|then she would show such patience and gratitude as would fully make up to them for her one more day of pleasure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0033.mp3|it was donald of course who had suggested the roses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0034.mp3|when the message came from the fourth floor back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0036.mp3|and her eyes had taken on a frightened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0037.mp3|hunted look|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0038.mp3|while the double v in her forehead flashed into sight for the first time since they had reached the atlantic coast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0039.mp3|he saw at once in what terror aunt crete held her sister and niece|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0040.mp3|and his indignation arose in true christian fashion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0042.mp3|and run away with dear aunt crete again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0043.mp3|hence the roses and the message|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0044.mp3|and aunt crete was fairly childish with pleasure over them when he finally persuaded her that it would be all right to send these in place of going up herself as she had been bidden|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0045.mp3|she listened eagerly as donald gave careful directions for the message|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0046.mp3|and the stately functionary respectfully repeated the words with his own high sounding inflection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0047.mp3|it made the pink come and go again in aunt crete's cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0048.mp3|and she felt that luella and carrie could not be angry with her after these roses|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0050.mp3|stylish a manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0051.mp3|the drive was one long dream of bliss to aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0052.mp3|they went miles up the coast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0053.mp3|and took lunch at a hotel much grander than the one they had left|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0055.mp3|her experience in hotels having broadened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0056.mp3|they also met some friends of donald's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0057.mp3|a professor from his alma mater|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0058.mp3|who with his wife was just returning from a trip to europe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0059.mp3|the bathers were making merry in the waves as they returned|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0060.mp3|and aunt crete's wistful look made donald ask whether she felt too tired to take another dip|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0061.mp3|but she declared she was not one bit tired|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0063.mp3|whatever happened now she had been in bathing twice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0064.mp3|she felt like quite an experienced bather|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0065.mp3|and she could dream of that wonderful experience of being lifted high above the swells in donald's strong young arms|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0066.mp3|she obediently took her nap|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0067.mp3|and surrendered herself to the hands of the maid to have the finishing touches put to her toilet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0069.mp3|and donald admired her when she emerged from her room in the dress|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0070.mp3|looking every inch a lady|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0072.mp3|but his eyes had said enough|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0073.mp3|and she felt a glow of humble pride in her new self|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0074.mp3|the self that he had created out of what she had always considered an unusually plain old woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0075.mp3|with the consciousness of her becoming attire upon her she turned with mild curiosity to see who had knocked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0076.mp3|and behold her sister and niece stood before her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0077.mp3|the day had been passed by them in melancholy speculations and the making and abandoning of many plans of procedure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0078.mp3|after careful deliberation they at last concluded that there was nothing to be done but go down and find out who these people really were|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0079.mp3|and if possible allay the ghost of their fears and set themselves free from their dull little room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0080.mp3|if it should be aunt crete and donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0081.mp3|we'll just settle them up and send them off at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0084.mp3|certainly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0087.mp3|trust me to settle with your aunt crete if it's really her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0088.mp3|but i can't think it is|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0091.mp3|and she never leaves her work till it's done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0093.mp3|what if it should be those folks you admire so much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0094.mp3|i've been thinking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0095.mp3|we had some new york cousins by the name of ward|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0096.mp3|it might be one of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0097.mp3|and donald might have gone to them first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0098.mp3|and they've brought him down here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0099.mp3|i can't think he's very much though|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0100.mp3|but we'll just hope for the best anyway till we find out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0103.mp3|and make her understand that she's got to go right home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0108.mp3|giggled luella in admiration|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0109.mp3|i'll tell her she must tell donald she's got to go right home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0111.mp3|and then we'll make him feel it wouldn't be gallant in him not to take her home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0113.mp3|but ma have you thought about your sprained ankle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0116.mp3|well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0117.mp3|i'll tell her the swelling's gone down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0119.mp3|and i'm all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0121.mp3|they had been somewhat puzzled how to find their possible relatives after they were attired for the advance on the enemy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0122.mp3|but consultation with the functionary in the office showed them that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0123.mp3|whoever miss ward and donald grant might be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0126.mp3|fastening a stubborn hook here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0127.mp3|putting up a stray rebellious lock there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0128.mp3|patting a puff into subordination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0130.mp3|burton was arrayed in an elaborate tucked and puffed and belaced lavender muslin whose laborious design had been attained through hours of the long winter evenings past|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0131.mp3|luella wore what she considered her most|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0138.mp3|reflected in staring hues in her already much burned nose and cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0139.mp3|her hair had been in preparation all the afternoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0140.mp3|and looked as if it was carved in waves and puffs out of black walnut|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0141.mp3|so closely was it beset with that most noticeable of all invisible devices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0142.mp3|an invisible net|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0144.mp3|and stood face to face with the wonderful lady in the gray gown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0145.mp3|whose every line and graceful fold spoke of the skill of a foreign tailor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0146.mp3|and then strange to say it was aunt crete who came to herself first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0147.mp3|perfectly conscious of her comely array|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0148.mp3|and strong in the strength of her handsome nephew who stood near to protect|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0149.mp3|she suddenly lost all fear of her fretful sister and bullying niece|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0150.mp3|and stepped forward with an unconscious grace of welcome that must have been hers all the time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0151.mp3|or it never would have come to the front in this crisis|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0152.mp3|why here you are at last luella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0153.mp3|how nice you look in your red crape|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0154.mp3|why carrie i'm real glad you've got better so you could come down|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0156.mp3|and here is donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0158.mp3|amazement and embarrassment struggled in the faces of mother and daughter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0159.mp3|they looked at aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0160.mp3|and they looked at donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0161.mp3|and then they looked at aunt crete again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0162.mp3|it couldn't be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0163.mp3|it wasn't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0165.mp3|the voice of aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0166.mp3|kind and forgiving|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0168.mp3|yet with a new something in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0169.mp3|or was it rather the lack of something|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0171.mp3|that was it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0173.mp3|yet which made them feel strangely ill at ease with this new old aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0174.mp3|they looked at each other bewildered|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0175.mp3|and then back at aunt crete again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0176.mp3|tracing line by line the familiar features in their new radiance of happiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0178.mp3|and the slinky sag of her old gowns|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0181.mp3|upon my word lucretia ward is it really you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0182.mp3|exclaimed her sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0183.mp3|making a wild dash into the conversation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0184.mp3|determined to right herself and everything else if possible|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0185.mp3|she felt like a person suddenly upset in a canoe|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0186.mp3|and she struggled wildly to get her footing once more if there was any solid footing anywhere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0187.mp3|with her sister crete standing there calmly in an imported gown|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0188.mp3|her hair done up like a fashion plate|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0189.mp3|and a millionaire's smile on her pleasant face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0190.mp3|but luella was growing angry|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0192.mp3|and was he really their western cousin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0194.mp3|and she always resented jokes at least|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0195.mp3|unless she played them herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0196.mp3|then donald came to the front for he feared for aunt crete's poise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0197.mp3|she must not lose her calm dignity and get frightened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0198.mp3|there was a sharp ring in the other aunt's voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0200.mp3|and is this my aunt carrie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0201.mp3|and my cousin luella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0202.mp3|he stepped forward and shook hands pleasantly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0203.mp3|i am glad to be able to speak with you at last|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0205.mp3|though it's not the first time i've seen you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0210.mp3|and tried to muster her scattered graces|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0211.mp3|and respond with her ravishing society air|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0212.mp3|but somehow the ease and grace of the man before her overpowered her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0213.mp3|and was he really her cousin|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0214.mp3|she tried to think what he could mean by having seen and talked with her before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0215.mp3|surely he must be mistaken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0217.mp3|she tossed her head with a kittenish movement|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0220.mp3|she asked wishing he had not been quite so quick to drop her hand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0222.mp3|why|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0223.mp3|i saw you the morning you left your home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0224.mp3|as i was getting out of the train|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0225.mp3|you were just entering|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0226.mp3|and you called out of the window to a young lady in a pony cart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0227.mp3|you wore a light kind of a yellowish suit didn't you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0228.mp3|yes i was very sure it was you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0229.mp3|he was studying her face closely|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0230.mp3|a curious twinkle in his eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0231.mp3|which might or might not have been complimentary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0234.mp3|she suddenly remembered what she had called out to the young lady in the pony cart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0235.mp3|and she wondered whether he had heard or noticed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0236.mp3|and then|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0237.mp3|went on her handsome persecutor|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0238.mp3|i had quite a long talk with you over the telephone you know|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0240.mp3|gasped luella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0242.mp3|why you must be mistaken|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0243.mp3|i never telephoned to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0246.mp3|questioned her mother sharply but donald interposed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0248.mp3|we are so excited over meeting you at last that we are forgetting to be courteous|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0249.mp3|he shoved forth a comfortable chair for his aunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0250.mp3|and another for the blushing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0251.mp3|overwhelmed luella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0252.mp3|and then he took aunt crete's hands lovingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0253.mp3|and gently pushed her backward into the most comfortable rocker in the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0254.mp3|it's just as cheap to sit down dear aunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0255.mp3|he said smiling|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0256.mp3|and you know you've had a pretty full day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0257.mp3|and must not get tired for to night's concert at the casino|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0258.mp3|now aunt carrie tell us about your ankle|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0259.mp3|how did you come to sprain it so badly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0260.mp3|and how did it get well so fast|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0261.mp3|we were quite alarmed about you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0262.mp3|is it really better|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0264.mp3|much as we wanted to see you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0265.mp3|we could have waited until it was quite safe for you to use it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0266.mp3|rather than have you run any risks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0267.mp3|then it was the mother's turn to blush|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0270.mp3|why i|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0274.mp3|rubbing it with liniment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0275.mp3|and all of a sudden she gave it a sort of a little pull|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0276.mp3|and something seemed to give way with a sharp pain|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0277.mp3|and then it came all right as good as ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0278.mp3|it feels a little weak but i think by morning it'll be all right|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0281.mp3|my ankles have always been weak anyway|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0282.mp3|i suffer a great deal with them in going about my work at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0284.mp3|said aunt crete leaning forward with troubled reproach in her face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0285.mp3|you never complained about it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0289.mp3|leaving her face pinched and haggard looking|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0290.mp3|she felt as if she were seeing visions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0291.mp3|this couldn't be her own sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0292.mp3|all dressed up so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0293.mp3|and yet speaking in the old sympathetic tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0295.mp3|it don't do any good|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0296.mp3|the conversation was interrupted by another tap on the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0297.mp3|donald opened it and received a large express package|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0302.mp3|then donald's clear voice broke in upon them as the door closed once more|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0304.mp3|boyish haste the cords of the express package|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0305.mp3|aunt crete your cloak has come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0306.mp3|now we'll all see if it's becoming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0307.mp3|bless the boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0308.mp3|said aunt crete looking up with delighted eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0309.mp3|cloak what cloak|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0311.mp3|there's the cloth coat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0312.mp3|and the silk one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0313.mp3|and that elegant black lace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0314.mp3|no you haven't|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0315.mp3|i saw right off what you needed when we went out in the auto last night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0317.mp3|and she's fixed it all up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0318.mp3|i hope you'll like it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0319.mp3|with that he pulled the cover off the box|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0320.mp3|and brought to view a long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0322.mp3|and a touch about the neck of black velvet and handsome creamy lace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0323.mp3|he held it up at arm's length admiringly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0325.mp3|it looks just like you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0326.mp3|i knew that woman would understand|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0327.mp3|stand up and let's see how you look in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0328.mp3|and then after dinner we'll take a little spin around the streets to try you in it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0329.mp3|aunt crete blushing like a pretty girl stood up|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0330.mp3|and he folded the soft garment about her in all its elegant richness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0331.mp3|she stood just in front of the full length mirror|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0332.mp3|and could not deny to herself that it was becoming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0333.mp3|but she was getting used to seeing herself look well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0334.mp3|and was not so much overpowered with the sight as she was with the tender thought of the boy that had got it for her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0336.mp3|and everything but that donald had gone to great trouble and expense to please her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0337.mp3|and she just turned around|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0338.mp3|and put her two hands|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0339.mp3|one on each of his cheeks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0340.mp3|standing on her tiptoes to reach him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0341.mp3|and kissed him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0344.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0345.mp3|you always like them so much|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0346.mp3|it is beautiful beautiful|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0347.mp3|she said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0349.mp3|it's much too beautiful for me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0350.mp3|donald you will spoil me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0351.mp3|yes i should think so|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0353.mp3|as if offering an apology in some sort for her childish aunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0354.mp3|a little spoiling won't hurt you dear aunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0355.mp3|said donald seriously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0356.mp3|i don't believe you've had your share of spoiling yet|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0357.mp3|and i mean to give it to you if i can|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0361.mp3|i suppose it's time to go down to dinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0363.mp3|are you sure your ankle is quite well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0364.mp3|are you able to go to the casino to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0365.mp3|i've tickets for us all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0367.mp3|and the programme is an unusually fine one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0370.mp3|in company with clarence grandon and his mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0371.mp3|was not to be lightly thrown away|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0372.mp3|and she crushed down her mortification|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0377.mp3|for she was watching her nephew's face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0378.mp3|and wondering how it came that such joy had fallen to her lot|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0379.mp3|there was no chance for the mortified mother and daughter to exchange a word as they went down in the elevator or followed in the wake of their relatives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0380.mp3|before whom all porters and office boys and even head waiters bowed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0381.mp3|and jumped to offer assistance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0382.mp3|they were having their wish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0384.mp3|entering the dining hall behind the handsome young man and the elegant|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0387.mp3|a part of the train|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0390.mp3|yet in what a way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0391.mp3|both were having ample opportunity for reflection|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0392.mp3|for they could see at a glance that no one noticed them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0393.mp3|and all attention was for those ahead of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0394.mp3|luella bit her lip angrily|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0395.mp3|and looked in wonder at aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0396.mp3|who somehow had lost her dumpiness|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0397.mp3|and walked as gracefully beside her tall young nephew as if she had been accustomed to walk in the eyes of the world thus for years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0398.mp3|the true secret of her grace|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0399.mp3|if luella had but known it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0400.mp3|was that she was not thinking in the least of herself|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0401.mp3|her conscience was at rest now|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0402.mp3|for the meeting between the cousins was over|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0403.mp3|and luella was to have a good time too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0404.mp3|aunt crete was never the least bit selfish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0407.mp3|behind her walked her sister and niece in mortified humiliation|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0408.mp3|luella was trying to recall just what she had said about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0411.mp3|and exactly what she had said to the girl in the pony cart the morning she left home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0412.mp3|the memory did not serve to cool her already heated complexion|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0413.mp3|it was beginning to dawn upon her that she had made a mighty mistake in running away from such a cousin and in such a manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0415.mp3|in such a case|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0417.mp3|and vent|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0421.mp3|in looking about to find such an object of blame her eyes naturally fell upon the one that had borne the greater part of all blame for her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0422.mp3|but|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0423.mp3|try as she would to pour out blame and scorn from her large|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0424.mp3|bold eyes upon poor aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0425.mp3|somehow the blame seemed to slip off from the sweet gray garments|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0426.mp3|and leave aunt crete as serene as ever|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0427.mp3|with her eyes turned trustingly toward her dear donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0428.mp3|luella was brought to the verge of vexation by this|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0429.mp3|and could scarcely eat any dinner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0431.mp3|with the happy abandonment of a child aunt crete opened it joyously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0432.mp3|who in the world can be writing to me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0433.mp3|she said wonderingly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0434.mp3|you'll have to read it for me donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0435.mp3|i've left my glasses up in my room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0437.mp3|but donald had it first|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0438.mp3|as if he had not seen her impatient hand claiming her right to read aunt crete's notes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0441.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0444.mp3|and my son makes such a baby of me that he thinks he cannot leave me alone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0445.mp3|but i do hope we can have the pleasure of the company of yourself and your nephew on a little auto trip to morrow afternoon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0446.mp3|my brother has a villa a few miles up the shore|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0447.mp3|and he telephoned us this morning to dine with them to night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0448.mp3|when he heard of your being here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0449.mp3|he said by all means to bring you with us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0450.mp3|my brother knows of your nephew's intimacy with clarence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0451.mp3|and is anxious to meet him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0452.mp3|as are the rest of his family|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0453.mp3|i do hope you will feel able to go with us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0458.mp3|aunt crete invited on automobile trips and dinners in villas|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0459.mp3|donald an intimate friend of clarence grandon's|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0461.mp3|what had she done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0462.mp3|or what had she undone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0463.mp3|she studied the handsome|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0464.mp3|keen face of her cousin as he bent over the letter|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0465.mp3|and writhed to think of her own words|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0467.mp3|she could hear it shouted from one end of the great dining hall to the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0468.mp3|and her face blazed redder and redder till she thought it would burst|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0469.mp3|her mother turned from her in mortified silence|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0471.mp3|studied politeness was the part that donald had set for himself that evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0472.mp3|he began to see that his victims were sufficiently unhappy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0474.mp3|though when he looked upon aunt crete's happy face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0475.mp3|and thought how white it had turned at dread of them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0477.mp3|but he said nothing further to distress them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0478.mp3|and they began to wonder whether|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0479.mp3|after all|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0480.mp3|he really had seen through their plan of running away from him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0481.mp3|it was all aunt crete's fault|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0484.mp3|abused aunt could have said would have convinced her that her cousin was worthy of her home coming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0487.mp3|when she was safely in her room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0488.mp3|what was to hinder them from going to her alone and having it out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0489.mp3|the sister's face hardened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0490.mp3|and the niece's eyes glittered as she stonily thought of the scornful sentences she would hurl after her aunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0491.mp3|donald looked at her menacing face and read its thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0492.mp3|he resolved to protect aunt crete whatever came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0493.mp3|so at the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0495.mp3|he said gently|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0497.mp3|for you've had a hard day of it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0498.mp3|and i want you to be bright and fresh for morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0499.mp3|we want to take an early dip in the ocean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0500.mp3|the bathing hours are early to morrow i see|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0501.mp3|he bowed good night in his pleasantest manner|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_06_hill_0502.mp3|and the ladies from the fourth floor reluctantly withdrew to the elevator|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0004.mp3|having just finished a most refreshing facial massage given at donald's express orders|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0006.mp3|rosy countenance|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0009.mp3|and quite startled her sister with its freshness and youth|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0011.mp3|or had she made a terrible mistake and entered the wrong apartment|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0012.mp3|but a change came suddenly over the ruddy countenance of aunt crete as over the face of a child that in the midst of happy play sees a trouble descending upon it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0013.mp3|a look almost of terror came over her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0014.mp3|and she caught her breath|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0015.mp3|and waited to see what was coming|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0017.mp3|she gasped weakly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0018.mp3|i thought you'd gone to bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0020.mp3|she's been giving me a face massage|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0021.mp3|you ought to try one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0022.mp3|it makes you feel young again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0024.mp3|said her affronted sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0025.mp3|i shouldn't care for one|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0026.mp3|marie looked over luella and her mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0027.mp3|beginning with the painfully elaborate arrangement of hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0028.mp3|and going down to the tips of their boots|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0030.mp3|let's sit down till she's done|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0033.mp3|thereupon the maid ignored them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0034.mp3|and went about her work|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0035.mp3|brushing out and deftly manipulating the wavy white hair|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0036.mp3|and chattering pleasantly meanwhile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0037.mp3|just as if no one else were in the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0038.mp3|aunt crete tried to forget what was before her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0044.mp3|and the uncooked jam|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0045.mp3|and the unmade shirt waists|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0046.mp3|and the little hot brick house gazing at her reproachfully from the distant home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0047.mp3|and she here in this fine array|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0048.mp3|forgetting it all and being waited upon by a maid a lazy truant from her duty|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0049.mp3|did the heart of the maid divine the state of things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0050.mp3|or was it only her natural instinct that made her turn to protect the pleasant little woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0051.mp3|in whose service she had already been well paid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0052.mp3|against the two women that were so evidently of the common walks of life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0053.mp3|and were trying to ape those that in the eyes of the maid were their betters|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0057.mp3|so that she lost her fear of the maid gradually|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0058.mp3|and yawned loudly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0059.mp3|declaring that aunt crete had surely had enough fussing over for one evening|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0060.mp3|they held in their more personal remarks until the door finally closed upon marie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0061.mp3|but burst forth so immediately that she heard the opening sentences through the transom|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0062.mp3|and thought it wise to step to the young gentleman's door and warn him that his elderly relative of whom he seemed so careful was likely to be disturbed beyond a reasonable hour for retiring|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0063.mp3|then she discreetly withdrew|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0064.mp3|having not only added to her generous income by a good bit of silver|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0065.mp3|but also having followed out the dictates of her heart|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0068.mp3|i should think you'd be ashamed aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0071.mp3|being waited on like a baby|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0072.mp3|when you ought to be at home this minute earning your living|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0076.mp3|and your own sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0077.mp3|who has supported you for years|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0078.mp3|up in a little dark fourth floor room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0079.mp3|such selfishness i never saw in all my life|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0080.mp3|i wouldn't have believed it of you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0081.mp3|though we might have suspected it long ago from the foolish things you were always doing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0083.mp3|she waved her hand tragically over the handsome room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0084.mp3|including the trunk standing open|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0085.mp3|and the gleam of silver gray silk that peeped through the half open closet door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0087.mp3|and you nothing in the world but a beggar a beggar|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0088.mp3|that's what you are a beggar dependent upon us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0091.mp3|and even having a maid|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0092.mp3|and shaming your own relatives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0093.mp3|and getting in ahead of us|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0094.mp3|who have always been good to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0095.mp3|and taking away our friends|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0096.mp3|and making us appear like two cents|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0097.mp3|it's just fierce aunt crete|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0098.mp3|it's it's heathenish|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0099.mp3|luella paused in her anger for a fitting word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0100.mp3|and then took the first one that came|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0102.mp3|she was devoted to the woman's missionary society|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0103.mp3|and it was terrible to be likened to a heathen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0105.mp3|i should think you'd be so ashamed you couldn't hold your head up before your honest relatives|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0106.mp3|went on the shameless girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0108.mp3|a stranger and you whining round and lowering yourself to let him buy you clothes and things|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0109.mp3|as if you didn't have proper clothes suited to your age and station|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0110.mp3|he's a young upstart coming along and daring to buy you any and such clothes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0111.mp3|do you know you're a laughing stock|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0114.mp3|think of you in your old purple calico washing the dishes at home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0115.mp3|and scrubbing the kitchen|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0120.mp3|and the little old lady looked into her eyes with a horrible fascination|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0121.mp3|while her great grief and horror poured down her sweet face in tears of anguish that would not be stayed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0123.mp3|luella saw that she was making an impression|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0124.mp3|and she went on more wildly than before|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0126.mp3|and not realizing how loud her voice was|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0127.mp3|and it isn't enough that you should do all that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0129.mp3|you can't keep up this masquerade long|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0132.mp3|what will they think of me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0136.mp3|your fault|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0137.mp3|and you'll never have a happy moment afterwards|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0139.mp3|now luella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0140.mp3|broke in aunt crete solemnly through her tears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0141.mp3|you're mistaken about one thing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0142.mp3|it won't be my fault there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0143.mp3|for it wouldn't have made a bit of difference|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0145.mp3|i'm real sorry for you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0146.mp3|and i meant to tell you just as soon as we got home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0147.mp3|for i couldn't bear to spoil your pleasure while we were here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0148.mp3|but that clarence grandon belongs to some one else|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0152.mp3|perhaps he was just being kind to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0153.mp3|for donald knows him real well|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0154.mp3|and he says he's engaged to a girl out west|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0155.mp3|and they're going to be married this fall|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0156.mp3|and donald says she's real sweet and|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0157.mp3|but aunt crete's quavering voice stopped suddenly in mild affright|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0159.mp3|shaking her finger in her aunt's face|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0160.mp3|and screaming at the top of her voice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0162.mp3|i say it's a lie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0165.mp3|no one heard the gentle knock that had been twice repeated during the scene|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0166.mp3|and no one saw the door open until they all suddenly became aware that donald stood in the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0167.mp3|looking from one face to another in angry surprise|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0168.mp3|donald had not retired at once after bidding aunt crete good night|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0169.mp3|he found letters and telegrams awaiting his attention|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0173.mp3|and stopped a moment before the door to make sure he heard voices|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0174.mp3|then he had knocked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0175.mp3|and knocked again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0177.mp3|his indignation knew no bounds|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0178.mp3|and he concluded his time had come to interfere|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0179.mp3|so he opened the door and went in|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0180.mp3|what does all this mean|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0181.mp3|he asked in a tone that frightened his aunt carrie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0183.mp3|no one spoke and aunt crete looked a mute appeal through her tears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0184.mp3|what is it dear aunt|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0185.mp3|he said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0188.mp3|shrinking little figure|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0189.mp3|who somehow in her sorrow and helplessness reminded him strongly of his own lost mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0190.mp3|he could not remember at that moment that the other woman|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0191.mp3|standing hard and cold and angry across the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0192.mp3|was also his mother's sister|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0193.mp3|she did not look like his mother nor act like her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0194.mp3|aunt crete put her little curled white head in its crisping pins down on donald's coat sleeve|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0196.mp3|it's just as i told you donald you dear boy|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0197.mp3|she sobbed out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0198.mp3|i oughtn't to have come|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0199.mp3|i knew it but it wasn't your fault|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0200.mp3|it was all mine|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0201.mp3|i ought to have stayed at home and not dressed up and come off here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0202.mp3|i've had a beautiful time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0203.mp3|but it wasn't for me and i oughtn't to have taken it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0204.mp3|it's just spoiled luella's nice time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0205.mp3|and she's blaming me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0206.mp3|just as i knew she would|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0207.mp3|what does my cousin mean by using that terrible word to you|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0208.mp3|which i heard as i entered the room|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0209.mp3|donald's voice was keen and scathing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0211.mp3|who answered not a word|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0212.mp3|that wasn't just what she'd have meant donald|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0213.mp3|said aunt crete apologetically|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0214.mp3|she was most out of her mind with trouble|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0220.mp3|go on aunt crete did my cousin call you a liar for saying that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0221.mp3|yet it was entirely true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0222.mp3|if she is not disposed to believe me either|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0224.mp3|he will come if i send for him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0225.mp3|but i feel sure after all that that will not be necessary|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0226.mp3|it is probably true|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0230.mp3|and did not mean what you said|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0232.mp3|and be sorry enough for worrying her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0234.mp3|she has had a wearying day and needs to be quiet at once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0237.mp3|and i feel as if i must take care of her|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0238.mp3|you seem to forget that i am your mother's sister too|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0239.mp3|said aunt carrie coldly|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0240.mp3|as she stood stiff and disapproving beside the door|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0241.mp3|ready to pass out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0242.mp3|if i do aunt carrie forgive me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0243.mp3|said donald courteously|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0244.mp3|it is not strange when you remember that you forgot that i was your sister's child|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0245.mp3|and ran away from me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0246.mp3|but never mind we will put that aside and try to forget it|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0247.mp3|good night aunt carrie|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0248.mp3|good night cousin luella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0249.mp3|we will all feel better about it in the morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0251.mp3|and went with shame and confusion to the fourth floor back|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0254.mp3|they burst into angry talk|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0255.mp3|each blaming the other|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0256.mp3|until at last luella sank in a piteous heap upon the bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0257.mp3|and gave herself over to helpless tears|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0259.mp3|said her mother in a business like tone|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0260.mp3|you stop that bawling and sit up here and answer me some questions|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0261.mp3|did you or did you not go riding with mister clarence grandon last winter in his automobile|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0263.mp3|well how'd it come about|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0264.mp3|there's no use sniffing|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0266.mp3|why it was a rainy day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0269.mp3|never mind what books tell me what happened|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0270.mp3|said the exasperated mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0272.mp3|was the filial reply|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0273.mp3|and for a moment nothing was heard in the room but sobs|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0274.mp3|however|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0275.mp3|luella recovered the thread of her story|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0277.mp3|where a championship game was being played|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0279.mp3|nor that he had not seemed to know her at first when she bowed in front of the library building|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0280.mp3|she had called out|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0281.mp3|it's a fine day for ducks mister grandon|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0282.mp3|isn't it good the game was yesterday instead of to day|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0283.mp3|and he had asked her to ride home with him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0284.mp3|that was her version|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0286.mp3|having loudly announced her lack of rubbers and umbrella|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0287.mp3|though she seldom wore rubbers|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0290.mp3|that was a very particular attention to show you if he was engaged|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0292.mp3|i don't suppose that meant anything either|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0294.mp3|we said the same words at the same time|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0296.mp3|when we girls did that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0297.mp3|the one that spoke first had to give the other a box of chocolates|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0298.mp3|so the next day he sent them|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0300.mp3|i don't think that was very nice|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0302.mp3|i guess you weren't a saint when you were a girl|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0303.mp3|besides i don't think you're very sympathetic|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0304.mp3|she mopped her swollen eyes|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0305.mp3|luella didn't he ever pay you any more attention after that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0306.mp3|i kind of thought you thought he liked you by the way you talked|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0307.mp3|no he never even looked at me|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0308.mp3|sobbed the girl her grief breaking out afresh|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0309.mp3|he didn't even know me the next time we met|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0310.mp3|but stared straight at me till i bowed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0311.mp3|and then he gave me a cold little touch of his hat|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0312.mp3|and down here he hasn't even recognized me once|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0313.mp3|i suppose that lady mother of his didn't like my looks|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0315.mp3|this has been pretty expensive trying to run around after the grandons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0318.mp3|and now no telling how aunt crete will act after we get home|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0321.mp3|there's one comfort|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0322.mp3|probably some of her clothes will fix over for you when she gets off her high horse and comes down to every day living again|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0323.mp3|but i wish you'd brace up and forget these grandons|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0324.mp3|it's no use trying to get up in the world higher than you belong|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0325.mp3|there's that nice john peters would have been real devoted to you if you'd just let him|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0326.mp3|and he owns a house of his own already|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0327.mp3|and has the name of being the best plumber in midvale|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0328.mp3|luella sighed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0330.mp3|well what's that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0331.mp3|snapped her practical mother|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0332.mp3|he may have his own automobile before long for all that|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0333.mp3|now dry up your eyes and go to sleep|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0336.mp3|and make her understand that she's not to disgrace us under any consideration by going in bathing while she's here|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0337.mp3|my land|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0338.mp3|i expect to see her riding round on one of those saddle ponies on the beach next|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0342.mp3|set out to show your cousin donald how nice you can be|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0343.mp3|and maybe some of the silk dresses will come your way|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0346.mp3|and john peters is at home when we get there|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0348.mp3|soothed in spirit|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0349.mp3|went to bed|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0350.mp3|and arose very early the next morning|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/9783/auntcretesemancipation_07_hill_0351.mp3|descending upon poor aunt crete while yet the dreams of sailing alone with donald on a moonlit sea were mingling with her waking thoughts|3
hi_fi_tts_v0/audio/92_clean/10425/secretagent_02_conrad_0318.mp3|how long have you been employed by the embassy here|3
