wavs/0_2.wav|This reading by Stefan MÃ¶bius of Oliver Twist or The Perish Boy's Progress by Charles Dickens, chapter 1.|1
wavs/0_3.wav|Treats of the place where Oliver Twist was born and of the circumstances attending his birth.|1
wavs/0_4.wav|Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning,|1
wavs/0_5.wav|and to which I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small, to wit, a workhouse.|1
wavs/0_6.wav|And in this workhouse was born, on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat,|1
wavs/0_7.wav|inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader in this stage of the business at all events,|1
wavs/0_8.wav|the item of mortality, whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter.|1
wavs/0_9.wav|For a long time, after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble by the parish surgeon,|1
wavs/0_10.wav|it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all,|1
wavs/0_11.wav|in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared,|1
wavs/0_12.wav|or if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages they would have possessed the|1
wavs/0_13.wav|inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography extent in the literature of any age or country.|1
wavs/0_14.wav|Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse is in itself the most|1
wavs/0_15.wav|fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say|1
wavs/0_16.wav|that in this particular instance it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred.|1
wavs/0_17.wav|The fact is that there was considerably difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office|1
wavs/0_18.wav|of respiration, a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy|1
wavs/0_19.wav|existence, and for some time he lay gasping in a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised|1
wavs/0_20.wav|between this world and the next, the balance being decidedly in favor of the latter.|1
wavs/0_21.wav|Now, if during this brief period Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers,|1
wavs/0_22.wav|anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and|1
wavs/0_23.wav|indubitably have been killed in no time. There, being nobody by, however, but a poor paroled woman|1
wavs/0_24.wav|who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer, and a parish surgeon who did|1
wavs/0_25.wav|such matters by contract, Oliver in nature fought out the point between them. The result was that|1
wavs/0_26.wav|after a few struggles Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the|1
wavs/0_27.wav|workers the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish by setting up as loud a|1
wavs/0_28.wav|cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that|1
wavs/0_29.wav|very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter.|1
wavs/0_30.wav|As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs,|1
wavs/0_31.wav|the patchwork coverlet, which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled. The pale face of|1
wavs/0_32.wav|a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow, and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words,|1
wavs/0_33.wav|Let me see the child and die. The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire,|1
wavs/0_34.wav|giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the young woman spoke, he rose,|1
wavs/0_35.wav|and advancing to the bedstead, said with more kindness than might have been expected of him,|1
wavs/0_36.wav|Oh, you must not talk about dying yet. Lord bless her dear heart, no, interposed the nurse, hastily|1
wavs/0_37.wav|depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner|1
wavs/0_38.wav|with evident satisfaction. Lord bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have,|1
wavs/0_39.wav|sir, and had thirteen children of her own, and all of them dead, except two, and them in the|1
wavs/0_40.wav|workers with me, she had no better than to take on in that way. Bless her dear heart. Think what|1
wavs/0_41.wav|is it to be a mother? There's a dear young lamb do. Apparently this consolatory perspective of|1
wavs/0_42.wav|a mother's prospects failed in producing its due effect. The patient shook her head and stretched|1
wavs/0_43.wav|out her hands towards the child. The surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold|1
wavs/0_44.wav|white lips passionately on its forehead, passed her hands over her face, gazed wildly round,|1
wavs/0_45.wav|shuddered, fell back and died. They chopped her breast, hands and temples, but the blood had|1
wavs/0_46.wav|stopped forever. They talked of hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.|1
wavs/0_47.wav|It's all over, Mrs. Tingummy, said the surgeon at last.|1
wavs/0_48.wav|Ah, poor dear, so it is, said the nurse, picking up the cork of the green bottle which had fallen|1
wavs/0_49.wav|out on the pillow as she stooped to take up the child. Poor dear. You needn't mind standing up|1
wavs/0_50.wav|to me if the child cries, nurse, said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation.|1
wavs/0_51.wav|It's very likely it will be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.|1
wavs/0_52.wav|He put on his hat and, pausing by the bedside on his way to the door, added,|1
wavs/0_53.wav|she was a good-looking girl too. Where did she come from?|1
wavs/0_54.wav|She was brought here last night, replied the old woman. By the overseer's order,|1
wavs/0_55.wav|she was found lying in the street. She had walked some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces,|1
wavs/0_56.wav|but where she came from or where she was going to, nobody knows.|1
wavs/0_57.wav|The surgeon leaned over the body and raised the left hand.|1
wavs/0_58.wav|The old story, he said, shaking his head. No wedding ring. I see. Good night.|1
wavs/0_59.wav|The medical gentleman walked away to dinner, and the nurse, having once more replied herself to|1
wavs/0_60.wav|the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before the fire and proceeded to dress the infant.|1
wavs/0_61.wav|What an excellent example of the power of dress young Oliver Twist was. Wrapped in the blanket,|1
wavs/0_62.wav|which had hitherto formed his only covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a|1
wavs/0_63.wav|beggar. It would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his propestation in|1
wavs/0_64.wav|society. But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same|1
wavs/0_65.wav|service, he was bagged and ticketed, and fell into the place at once. A parish child,|1
wavs/0_66.wav|the orphan of a workhouse, the humble half-starved drudge to be cuffed and buffeted through the|1
wavs/0_67.wav|world, despised by all and pitied by none. Oliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was|1
wavs/0_68.wav|an orphan, left to the tender mercies of church wardens and overseers, perhaps he would have|1
wavs/0_69.wav|cried the louder. End of chapter 1|1
wavs/1_0.wav|The Island of Dr. Moreau, Chapter VIII.|1
wavs/1_1.wav|The Crying of the Puma.|1
wavs/1_2.wav|Montgomery interrupted my tangle of mystification and suspicion about one o'clock, and his grotesque|1
wavs/1_3.wav|attendant followed him, with a tray bearing bread, some herbs and other eatables, a flask of whiskey,|1
wavs/1_4.wav|a jug of water and three glasses, and knives. I glanced askance at this strange creature,|1
wavs/1_5.wav|and found him watching me with his queer restless eyes. Montgomery said he would|1
wavs/1_6.wav|lunch with me, but that Moreau was too preoccupied with some work to come.|1
wavs/1_7.wav|Moreau, said I, I know that name.|1
wavs/1_8.wav|The devil you do, said he.|1
wavs/1_9.wav|What an ass I was to mention it to you, I might have thought. Anyhow,|1
wavs/1_10.wav|it will give you an inkling of our mysteries. Whiskey?|1
wavs/1_11.wav|No thanks, I'm an abstainer.|1
wavs/1_12.wav|I wish I had been, but it's no use locking the door after the steed is stolen.|1
wavs/1_13.wav|It was that infernal stuff that led to my coming here.|1
wavs/1_14.wav|That, and a foggy night.|1
wavs/1_15.wav|I thought myself in luck at the time, when Moreau offered to get me off its queer|1
wavs/1_16.wav|Montgomery, said I, suddenly as the outer door closed.|1
wavs/1_17.wav|Why has your man pointed ears?|1
wavs/1_18.wav|Damn, he said, over his first mouthful of food. He stared at me for a moment, and then repeated,|1
wavs/1_19.wav|Pointed ears?|1
wavs/1_20.wav|Little points to them, said I, as calmly as possible, with a catch in my breath.|1
wavs/1_21.wav|And a fine black fur at the edges.|1
wavs/1_22.wav|He helped himself to whiskey and water with great deliberation.|1
wavs/1_23.wav|I was under the impression that his hair covered his ears.|1
wavs/1_24.wav|I saw them as he stooped by me to put that coffee you sent me on the table,|1
wavs/1_25.wav|and his eyes shine in the dark.|1
wavs/1_26.wav|But this time Montgomery was not so.|1
wavs/1_27.wav|But this time Montgomery had recovered from the surprise of my question.|1
wavs/1_28.wav|I always thought, he said deliberately, with a certain accentuation of his flavouring of lisp,|1
wavs/1_29.wav|that there was something the matter with his ears from the way he covered them.|1
wavs/1_30.wav|What were they like?|1
wavs/1_31.wav|I was persuaded from his manner that this ignorance was a pretense.|1
wavs/1_32.wav|Still I could hardly tell the man that I thought him a liar.|1
wavs/1_33.wav|Pointed, I said, rather small and furry, distinctly furry,|1
wavs/1_34.wav|but the whole man is one of the strangest beings I have ever set eyes on.|1
wavs/1_35.wav|A sharp hoarse cry of animal pain came from the enclosure behind us.|1
wavs/1_36.wav|Its depth and volume testified to the puma. I saw Montgomery wince.|1
wavs/1_37.wav|Yes, he said.|1
wavs/1_38.wav|Where did you pick up the creature?|1
wavs/1_39.wav|San Francisco. He's an ugly brute, I admit. Half-witted, you know.|1
wavs/1_40.wav|Can't remember where he came from.|1
wavs/1_41.wav|But I'm used to him, you know. We both are.|1
wavs/1_42.wav|How does he strike you?|1
wavs/1_43.wav|He's unnatural, I said. There's something about him.|1
wavs/1_44.wav|Don't think me fanciful, but it gives me a nasty little sensation,|1
wavs/1_45.wav|a tightening of my muscles when he comes near me.|1
wavs/1_46.wav|It's a touch of the diabolical, in fact.|1
wavs/1_47.wav|Montgomery had stopped eating while I told him this.|1
wavs/1_48.wav|Rum! he said.|1
wavs/1_49.wav|I can't see it. He resumed his meal.|1
wavs/1_50.wav|I had no idea of it, he said, and masticated.|1
wavs/1_51.wav|The crew of the Shona must have felt it the same, made a dead set at the poor devil.|1
wavs/1_52.wav|You saw the captain?|1
wavs/1_53.wav|Suddenly the puma howled again, this time more like a wolf.|1
wavs/1_54.wav|More painfully.|1
wavs/1_55.wav|Montgomery swore under his breath.|1
wavs/1_56.wav|I had half a mind to attack him about the man on the beach,|1
wavs/1_57.wav|and the poor brute within gave vent to a series of short, sharp cries.|1
wavs/1_58.wav|Your men on the beach, said I. What race are they?|1
wavs/1_59.wav|Excellent fellows, aren't they? said he, absentmindedly,|1
wavs/1_60.wav|knitting his brows as the animal yelled out sharply.|1
wavs/1_61.wav|I said no more.|1
wavs/1_62.wav|There was another outcry worse than the former.|1
wavs/1_63.wav|He looked at me with his dull gray eyes, and then took some more whiskey.|1
wavs/1_64.wav|He tried to draw me into a discussion about alcohol,|1
wavs/1_65.wav|professing to have saved my life with it.|1
wavs/1_66.wav|He seemed anxious to lay stress on the fact that I owed my life to him.|1
wavs/1_67.wav|I answered him distractedly.|1
wavs/1_68.wav|Presently our meal came to an end.|1
wavs/1_69.wav|The mishap and monster with the pointed ears cleared the remains away,|1
wavs/1_70.wav|and Montgomery left me alone in the room again.|1
wavs/1_71.wav|All the time he had been in a state of ill-concealed irritation at the noise|1
wavs/1_72.wav|of the vivisected puma.|1
wavs/1_73.wav|He had spoken of his odd want of nerve and left me to the obvious application.|1
wavs/1_74.wav|I found myself that the cries were singularly irritating,|1
wavs/1_75.wav|and they grew in depth and intensity as the afternoon wore on.|1
wavs/1_76.wav|They were painful at first, but their constant resurgence|1
wavs/1_77.wav|at last altogether upset my balance.|1
wavs/1_78.wav|I flung aside a crib of horrors, I had been reading, and began to clench my fists,|1
wavs/1_79.wav|to bite my lips, and to pace the room.|1
wavs/1_80.wav|Presently I got to stopping my ears with my fingers.|1
wavs/1_81.wav|The emotional appeal of those yells grew upon me steadily,|1
wavs/1_82.wav|grew at last to such an exquisite expression of suffering|1
wavs/1_83.wav|that I could stand it in that confined room no longer.|1
wavs/1_84.wav|I stepped out of the door into the slumbrous heat of the late afternoon.|1
wavs/1_86.wav|The crying sounded even louder out of doors.|1
wavs/1_87.wav|It was as if all the pain in the world had found a voice.|1
wavs/1_88.wav|Yet had I known such pain was in the next room, and had it been done, I believe,|1
wavs/1_89.wav|I have thought since I could have stood it well enough.|1
wavs/1_90.wav|It is when suffering finds a voice and sets our nerves equipped to fight it,|1
wavs/1_91.wav|that this pity comes troubling us.|1
wavs/1_92.wav|But in spite of the brilliant sunlight, and the green fans of the trees wavering,|1
wavs/1_93.wav|and the soothing sea breeze, the world was a confusion, blurred with drifting black and red|1
wavs/1_94.wav|phantasms, until I was out of earshot of the house in the checkered wall.|1
wavs/2_0.wav|I strode through the undergrowth that closed the ridge behind the house, scarcely heeding|1
wavs/2_1.wav|whither I went, passed on through the shadows of the thick cluster of straight-stemmed trees|1
wavs/2_2.wav|beyond it, and so presently found myself some way on the other side of the ridge,|1
wavs/2_3.wav|and descending towards a streamlet that ran through a narrow valley. I paused and listened.|1
wavs/2_4.wav|The distance I had come, or the intervening masses of thicket, deadened any sound that|1
wavs/2_5.wav|might be coming from the enclosure. The air was still. Then with a rustle a rabbit emerged and|1
wavs/2_6.wav|went scampering up the slope before me. I hesitated and sat down in the edge of the shade.|1
wavs/2_7.wav|The place was a pleasant one. The rivulet was hidden by the luxuriant vegetation of the banks|1
wavs/2_8.wav|safe at one point, where I caught a triangular patch of its glittering water. On the farther side|1
wavs/2_9.wav|I saw through a bluish haze of a tangle of trees and creepers, and above these, again the luminous|1
wavs/2_10.wav|blue of the sky, here and there a splash of white or crimson, marked the blooming of some|1
wavs/2_11.wav|trailing epiphyte. I let my eyes wander over this scene for a while, and then began to turn over|1
wavs/2_12.wav|in my mind again the strange peculiarities of Montgomery's men. But it was too hard to think|1
wavs/2_13.wav|elaborately, and presently I fell into a tranquil state midway between dozing and waking.|1
wavs/2_14.wav|From this I was aroused, after a no-not-how-long, by rustling amidst the greenery on the other side|1
wavs/2_15.wav|of the steam. For a moment I could see nothing but the waving summits of the ferns and reeds.|1
wavs/2_16.wav|Then suddenly upon the bank of the stream appeared something. At first I could not distinguish what|1
wavs/2_17.wav|it was. It bound its round head to the water and began to drink. Then I saw it was a man,|1
wavs/2_18.wav|going on all fours like a beast. He was clothed in bluish cloth, and was of a copper-colored hue|1
wavs/2_19.wav|with black hair. It seemed that grotesque ugliness was an invariable character of these islanders. I|1
wavs/2_20.wav|could hear the suck of the water at his lips as he drank. I leaned forward to see him better,|1
wavs/2_21.wav|and a piece of lava detached by my hand went pattering down the slope. He looked up guiltily,|1
wavs/2_22.wav|and his eyes met mine. Forthwith he scrambled to his feet and stooped, wiping his clumsy hand|1
wavs/2_23.wav|across his mouth and regarding me. His legs were scarcely half the length of his body,|1
wavs/2_24.wav|so staring one another out of countenance, we remained for perhaps the space of a minute. Then|1
wavs/2_25.wav|stopping to look back once or twice he slunk off among the bushes to the right of me, and I heard|1
wavs/2_26.wav|the swish of the fronds grow faint in the distance and die away. Long after he had disappeared,|1
wavs/2_27.wav|I remained sitting up staring in the direction of his retreat. My drowsy tranquility had gone.|1
wavs/2_28.wav|I was startled by a noise behind me, and turning suddenly, saw the flapping white tail of a rabbit|1
wavs/2_29.wav|vanishing up the slope. I jumped to my feet. The apparition of this grotesque half-bestial|1
wavs/2_30.wav|creature had suddenly populated the stillness of the afternoon for me. I looked around me,|1
wavs/2_31.wav|rather nervously, and regretted that I was unarmed. Then I thought that the man I had|1
wavs/2_32.wav|just seen had been clothed in bluish cloth, had not been naked as a savage would have been,|1
wavs/2_33.wav|and I tried to persuade myself from the fact that he was, after all, probably a peaceful character,|1
wavs/2_34.wav|and the dull ferocity of his countenance belied him, yet I was greatly disturbed at the apparition.|1
wavs/2_35.wav|I walked to the left along the slope, turning my head about and peering this way and that among|1
wavs/2_36.wav|the straight stems of the trees. Why should a man go on all fours and drink with his lips?|1
wavs/2_37.wav|Presently I heard an animal wailing again, and taking it to be the puma, I turned about and|1
wavs/2_38.wav|walked in a direction diametrically opposite to the sound. This led me down to the stream,|1
wavs/2_39.wav|across which I stepped and pushed my way up through the undergrowth beyond. I was startled|1
wavs/2_40.wav|by a great patch of vivid scarlet on the ground, and going up to it found it to be a peculiar|1
wavs/2_41.wav|fungus, branched and corrugated like a foliaceous leechan, but delicacying into slime at the touch.|1
wavs/2_42.wav|And then, in the shadow of some luxuriant ferns, I came upon an unpleasant thing, the dead body of|1
wavs/2_43.wav|a rabbit covered with shining flies, but still warm and with a head torn off. I stopped aghast at the|1
wavs/2_44.wav|sight of the scattered blood. Here at last was one visitor to the island disposed of. There were no|1
wavs/2_45.wav|traces of other violence about it. It looked as though it had been suddenly snatched up and killed,|1
wavs/2_46.wav|and as I stared at the little furry body came the difficulty of how the thing had been done. The|1
wavs/2_47.wav|vague dread that had been in my mind since I had seen the inhumane face of the man at the stream|1
wavs/2_48.wav|grew distincter as I stood there. I began to realize the hardyhood of my expedition among|1
wavs/2_49.wav|these unknown people. The thicket about me became altered to my imagination. Every shadow became|1
wavs/2_50.wav|something more than a shadow, became an ambush, every rustle became a threat, invisible things|1
wavs/2_51.wav|seemed watching me. I resolved to go back to the enclosure on the beach. I suddenly turned away|1
wavs/2_52.wav|and thrust myself violently, possibly even frantically, through the bushes, anxious to|1
wavs/2_53.wav|get a clear space about me again. I stopped just in time to prevent myself emerging upon an open|1
wavs/2_54.wav|space. It was a kind of glade in the forest, made by a fall. Seedlings were already starting up the|1
wavs/2_55.wav|struggle for the vacant space, and beyond, the dense growth of the stems and twining vines and|1
wavs/2_56.wav|splashes of fungus and flowers closed in again. Before me, squatting together upon the fungoid|1
wavs/2_57.wav|ruins of a huge fallen tree and still unaware of my approach, were three grotesque human figures.|1
wavs/2_58.wav|One was evidently a female, the other two were men. They were naked, save for thwossing of scarlet|1
wavs/2_59.wav|cloth about the middle, and their skins were of a dull pinkish drab color, such as I had seen no|1
wavs/2_60.wav|savages before. They had fat, heavy, chinless faces, retreating foreheads, and a scant bristly|1
wavs/2_61.wav|hair upon their heads. I never saw such bestial-looking creatures. They were talking, or at least one of|1
wavs/2_62.wav|them was talking to the other two, and all three had been too closely interested to heed the rustling|1
wavs/2_63.wav|of my approach. They swayed their heads and shoulders from side to side. Their speakers'|1
wavs/2_64.wav|words came thick and sloppy, and though I could hear them distinctly, I could not distinguish what|1
wavs/2_65.wav|he said. He seemed to me to be reciting some complicated gibberish. Presently, his articulation|1
wavs/2_66.wav|became shriller, and spreading his hands, he rose to his feet. At that, the others began to gibber|1
wavs/2_67.wav|in unison, also rising to their feet, spreading their hands and swaying their bodies in rhythm|1
wavs/2_68.wav|with their chant. I noticed then the abnormal shortness of their legs and their long, clumsy feet.|1
wavs/2_69.wav|All three began slowly to circle around, raising and stamping their feet and waving their arms,|1
wavs/2_70.wav|a kind of tune crept into their rhythmic recitation and a refrain.|1
wavs/2_71.wav|It sounded like. Their eyes began to sparkle and their ugly faces to brighten, with an expression|1
wavs/2_72.wav|of strange pleasure, saliva dripped from their lipless mouths. Suddenly, as I watched their|1
wavs/2_73.wav|grotesque and unaccountable gesture, I perceived clearly for the first time what it was that had|1
wavs/2_74.wav|offended me, what had given me the too inconsistent and conflicting impressions of|1
wavs/2_75.wav|utter strangeness and yet of the strangest familiarity. The three creatures engaged in this|1
wavs/2_76.wav|mysterious rite were human in shape, and yet human beings were the strangest air about them of some|1
wavs/2_77.wav|familiar animal. Each of these creatures, despite its human form, its rack of clothing and the rough|1
wavs/2_78.wav|humanity of its bodily form, had woven into it, into its movements, into the expression of its|1
wavs/2_79.wav|countenance, into its whole presence, some irresistible suggestion of a hawk, a swinish|1
wavs/2_80.wav|teint, the unmistakable mark of the beast. I stood overcome by this amazing realization,|1
wavs/2_81.wav|and then the most horrible questionings came rushing into my mind.|1
wavs/2_82.wav|They began leaping in the air, first one, then the other, whooping and grunting. Then one slipped,|1
wavs/2_83.wav|and for a moment was on all fours to recover indeed forthwith. But that transitory gleam of|1
wavs/2_84.wav|the true animalism of these monsters was enough. I turned, as noiseless as possible, and becoming|1
wavs/2_85.wav|every now and then rigged with the fear of being discovered, as a branch cracked or a leaf rustled,|1
wavs/2_86.wav|I pushed back into the bushes. It was long before I grew bolder and dared to move freely.|1
wavs/2_87.wav|My only idea for the moment was to get away from these fool beings, and I scarcely noticed|1
wavs/2_88.wav|that I had emerged upon a faint pathway amidst the trees. Then suddenly, traversing a little glade,|1
wavs/2_89.wav|I saw with an unpleasant start two clumsy legs among the trees, walking with noiseless footsteps|1
wavs/2_90.wav|parallel with my course, and perhaps thirty yards away from me.|1
wavs/2_91.wav|The head and upper part of the body were hidden by a tangle of creeper.|1
wavs/2_92.wav|I stopped abruptly, hoping the creature did not see me. The feet stopped as I did. So nervous was|1
wavs/2_93.wav|I that I controlled an impulse to headlong flight with the utmost difficulty. Then, looking hard,|1
wavs/2_94.wav|I distinguished through the interlacing network the head and body of the brute I had seen drinking.|1
wavs/2_95.wav|He moved his head. There was an emerald flash in his eye as he glanced at me from the shadow|1
wavs/2_96.wav|of the trees, a half-luminous color that vanished as he turned his head again.|1
wavs/2_97.wav|He was motionless for a moment, and then with a noiseless tread began running through the green|1
wavs/2_98.wav|confusion. In another moment he had vanished behind some bushes.|1
wavs/2_99.wav|I could not see him, but I felt that he had stopped and was watching me again.|1
wavs/2_100.wav|What on earth was he? Man or beast? What did he want with me? I had no weapon, not even a stick.|1
wavs/2_101.wav|Flight would be madness. At any rate, the thing, whatever it was, lacked the courage to attack me.|1
wavs/2_102.wav|Setting my teeth hard, I walked straight towards him. I was anxious not to show the fear that seemed|1
wavs/2_103.wav|chilling my backbone. I pushed through a tangle of tall, white-flowered bushes and saw him twenty|1
wavs/2_104.wav|paces beyond, looking over his shoulder at me and hesitating. I advanced a step or two, looking|1
wavs/2_105.wav|steadfastly into his eyes. Who are you? said I. He tried to meet my gaze. No, he said suddenly,|1
wavs/2_106.wav|and turning went bounding away from me through the undergrowth. Then he turned and stared at me|1
wavs/2_107.wav|again, his eyes shone brightly out of the dusk under the trees. My heart was in my mouth, but I|1
wavs/2_108.wav|felt my only chance was bluff and walked steadily towards him. He turned again and vanished into the|1
wavs/2_109.wav|dusk. Once more, I thought, I caught the glint of his eyes, and that was all. For the first time,|1
wavs/2_110.wav|I realized how the lateness of the hour might affect me. The sun had set some minutes since,|1
wavs/2_111.wav|the swift dusk of the tropics was already fading out of the eastern sky,|1
wavs/2_112.wav|and a pioneer moth fluttered silently by my head.|1
wavs/2_113.wav|Unless I would spend the night among the unknown dangers of the mysterious forest,|1
wavs/2_114.wav|I must hasten back to the enclosure. The thought of the return to that pain-haunted refuge was|1
wavs/2_115.wav|extremely disagreeable, but still more so was the idea of being overtaken in the open by darkness,|1
wavs/2_116.wav|and all that darkness might conceal. I gave one more look into the blue shadows that had swung|1
wavs/2_117.wav|up this odd creature, and then retraced my way down the slope towards the stream,|1
wavs/2_118.wav|going as I judged in the direction from which I had come.|1
wavs/2_119.wav|I walked eagerly, my mind confused with many things, and presently found myself in a level|1
wavs/2_120.wav|place among scattered trees. The colorless clearness that comes after the sunset flush was|1
wavs/2_121.wav|darkening, the blue sky above grew momentarily deeper, and the little stars one by one pierced|1
wavs/2_122.wav|the attenuated light. The interspaces of the trees, the gaps in the furthest vegetation that|1
wavs/2_123.wav|had been hazy blue in the daylight, grew black and mysterious. I pushed on. The color vanished|1
wavs/2_124.wav|from the world. The treetops rose against the luminous blue sky in an inky silhouette,|1
wavs/2_125.wav|and all below the outline melted into one formless blackness. Presently the trees grew thinner,|1
wavs/2_126.wav|and the shrubbery undergrowth more abundant. Then there was a desolate space covered with a white|1
wavs/2_127.wav|sand, and then another expanse of tangled bushes. I did not remember crossing this sand opening|1
wavs/2_128.wav|before. I began to be tormented by a faint rustling upon my right hand. I thought at first it was|1
wavs/2_129.wav|fancy, for whenever I stopped there was silence, save for the evening breeze in the treetops.|1
wavs/2_130.wav|Then when I turned to hurry on again, there was an echo to my footsteps.|1
wavs/2_131.wav|I turned away from the thickets, keeping to the more open ground, and endeavoring|1
wavs/2_132.wav|by sudden turns now then to surprise something in the fact of creeping upon me.|1
wavs/2_133.wav|I saw nothing. Nevertheless, my sense of another presence grew steadily.|1
wavs/2_134.wav|I increased my pace, and after some time came to a slight ridge, crossed it, and turned sharply,|1
wavs/2_135.wav|regarding it steadfastly from the other side. It came out black and clear-cut against the darkening|1
wavs/2_136.wav|sky. Presently a shapeless lump heaved up momentarily against the skyline and vanished again.|1
wavs/2_137.wav|I felt assured now that my tawny-faced antagonist was stalking me once more, and coupled with that|1
wavs/2_138.wav|was another unpleasant realization that I had lost my way.|1
wavs/2_139.wav|For a time I heard it on, hopelessly perplexed, and pursued by that stealthy approach. Whatever|1
wavs/2_140.wav|it was, the thing either lacked the courage to attack me, or it was waiting to take me at some|1
wavs/2_141.wav|disadvantage. I kept studiously to the open. At times I would turn and listen, and presently I|1
wavs/2_142.wav|had half-persuaded myself that my pursuer had abandoned the chase, or was a mere creation of|1
wavs/2_143.wav|my disordered imagination. Then I heard the sound of the sea. I quickened my footsteps almost into|1
wavs/2_144.wav|run, and immediately there was a stumble in my rear. I turned suddenly, and stared at the|1
wavs/2_145.wav|uncertain trees behind me. One black shadow seemed to leap into another. I listened, rigid,|1
wavs/2_146.wav|and heard nothing but the creep of blood in my ears. I thought that my nerves were|1
wavs/2_147.wav|unstrung, that my imagination was tricking me, and turned resolutely towards the sound of the sea again.|1
wavs/2_148.wav|In a minute or so the trees grew thinner, and I emerged upon a bare, low headland running out|1
wavs/2_149.wav|into the somber water. The night was calm and clear, and the reflection of the growing multitude|1
wavs/2_150.wav|of the stars shivered in the tranquil heaving of the sea. Some way out, the wash upon an irregular|1
wavs/2_151.wav|band of reef stone, with a pallid light of its own. Westward I saw the zodiacal light mingling with|1
wavs/2_152.wav|the yellow brilliance of the evening star. The coast fell away from me to the east, and westward|1
wavs/2_153.wav|it was hidden by the shoulder of the cape. Then I recalled the fact that Moreau's beach lay to the west.|1
wavs/2_154.wav|A twig snapped behind me, and there was a rustle. I turned and stood facing the dark trees.|1
wavs/2_155.wav|I could see nothing, or else I could see too much. Every dark form in the dimness had its|1
wavs/2_156.wav|ominous quality, its peculiar suggestion of alert watchfulness. So I stood for perhaps a minute,|1
wavs/2_157.wav|and then with an eye to the tree still, turned westwards to cross the headland.|1
wavs/2_158.wav|And as I moved, one among the lurking shadows moved to follow me.|1
wavs/2_159.wav|My heart beat quickly. Presently the broad sweep of a bay to the westward became visible,|1
wavs/2_160.wav|and I halted again. The noiseless shadow halted a dozen yards from me. A little point of light|1
wavs/2_161.wav|shone on the further bend of the curve, and the gray sweep of the sandy beach lay faint under the|1
wavs/2_162.wav|starlight. Perhaps two miles away was that little point of light. To get to the beach,|1
wavs/2_163.wav|I should have to go through the trees where the shadows lurked, and down a bushy slope.|1
wavs/2_164.wav|I could see the thing rather more distinctly now. It was no animal, for it stood erect,|1
wavs/2_165.wav|and then I opened my mouth to speak, and found a hoarse flag choked my voice. I tried again and|1
wavs/2_166.wav|shouted, Who is there? There was no answer. I advanced a step. The thing did not move,|1
wavs/2_167.wav|only gather itself together. My foot struck a stone that gave me an idea.|1
wavs/2_168.wav|Without taking my eyes off the black form before me, I stooped and picked up this lump of rock.|1
wavs/2_169.wav|But at my motion the thing turned abruptly as a dog might have done, and slunk obliquely into the|1
wavs/2_170.wav|further darkness. Then I recalled a schoolboy expedient against big dogs, and twisted the rock|1
wavs/2_171.wav|into my handkerchief, and gave this a turn round my wrist. I heard movement further off amongst the|1
wavs/2_172.wav|shadows, as if the thing was in retreat. Then suddenly my tense excitement gave way. I broke|1
wavs/2_173.wav|into profuse perspiration, and fell a-trembling, with my adversary routed, and this weapon in my|1
wavs/2_174.wav|hand. It was some time before I could summon resolution to go down through the trees and|1
wavs/2_175.wav|bushes upon the flank of the headland to the beach. At last I did it at a run, and as I emerged|1
wavs/2_176.wav|from the thicket upon the sand, I heard some other body coming crashing after me. At that I completely|1
wavs/2_177.wav|lost my head with fear, and began running along the sand. Forthwith there came the swift patter|1
wavs/2_178.wav|of soft feet in pursuit. I gave a wild cry, and redoubled my pace. Some dim black things, about|1
wavs/2_179.wav|three or four times the size of rabbits, went running or hopping up from the beach towards the|1
wavs/2_180.wav|bushes as I passed. So long as I live I shall remember the terror of that chase. I ran near the|1
wavs/2_181.wav|water's edge, and heard every now and then the splashes of the feet that gained upon me. Far away,|1
wavs/2_182.wav|hopelessly far, was the yellow light. All the night about us was black and still. Splash,|1
wavs/2_183.wav|splash, came the pursuing feet, nearer and nearer. I felt my breath going, for I was quite out of|1
wavs/2_184.wav|training. It whooped as I drooped, and I felt a pain like a knife at my side. I perceived the|1
wavs/2_185.wav|thing would come up with me long before I reached the enclosure, and desperate and sobbing for my|1
wavs/2_186.wav|breath, I wheeled round upon it, and struck at it as it came upon me, struck with all my strength.|1
wavs/2_187.wav|The stone came out of the sling of the handkerchief as I did so. As I turned, the thing which had been|1
wavs/2_188.wav|running on all fours rose to its feet, and the missile fell fair on its left temple. The skull|1
wavs/2_189.wav|rung loud, and the animal man blundered into me, thrust me back with its hands, and when staggering|1
wavs/2_190.wav|passed me, too fell headlong upon the sand with its face in the water, and there it lay still.|1
wavs/2_191.wav|I could not bring myself to approach that black heap. I left it there, with the water rippling|1
wavs/2_192.wav|around it under the still stars, and giving it a white birth, pursued my way towards the yellow glow|1
wavs/2_193.wav|of the house, and presently, with a positive effect of relief, came the pitiful moaning of the puma,|1
wavs/2_194.wav|a sound that had originally driven me out to explore this mysterious island.|1
wavs/2_195.wav|At that, though I was faint and horrible fatigued, I gathered together all my strength|1
wavs/2_196.wav|and began running again towards the light. I thought I heard a voice calling me.|1

wavs/3_5.wav|Foreword to the reader of this work.|1
wavs/3_6.wav|In submitting Captain Carter's strange manuscript to you in book form,|1
wavs/3_7.wav|I believe that a few words relative to this remarkable personality will be of interest.|1
wavs/3_8.wav|My first recollection of Captain Carter is of the few months he spent at my father's home in Virginia,|1
wavs/3_9.wav|just prior to the opening of the Civil War.|1
wavs/3_10.wav|I was then a child of but five years,|1
wavs/3_11.wav|yet I shall remember the tall, dark, smooth-faced, athletic man,|1
wavs/3_12.wav|whom I called Uncle Jack.|1
wavs/3_13.wav|He seemed always to be laughing,|1
wavs/3_14.wav|and he entered into the sports of the children with the same hearty good fellowship he displayed|1
wavs/3_15.wav|about those pastimes in which the men and women of his own age indulged.|1
wavs/3_16.wav|Or he would sit for an hour at a time entertaining my old grandmother with stories of his strange,|1
wavs/3_17.wav|wild life in all parts of the world.|1
wavs/3_18.wav|We all loved him, and our slaves fairly worshipped the ground he trod.|1
wavs/3_19.wav|He was a splendid specimen of manhood, standing a good two inches over six feet,|1
wavs/3_20.wav|broad of shoulder and narrow of hip, with the carriage of a trained fighting man.|1
wavs/3_21.wav|His features were regular and clear-cut,|1
wavs/3_22.wav|his hair black and closely cropped,|1
wavs/3_23.wav|while his eyes were of a steel gray reflecting a strong and loyal character,|1
wavs/3_24.wav|filled with fire and initiative.|1
wavs/3_25.wav|His manners were perfect,|1
wavs/3_26.wav|and his courtliness was that of a typical southern gentleman of the highest type.|1
wavs/3_27.wav|His horsemanship especially after hounds was a marvel and delight,|1
wavs/3_28.wav|even in that country of magnificent horsemen.|1
wavs/3_29.wav|I have often heard my father caution him against his wild recklessness,|1
wavs/3_30.wav|but he would only laugh, and say that the tumble that killed him|1
wavs/3_31.wav|would be from the back of a horse yet unfold.|1
wavs/3_32.wav|When the war broke out he left us, nor did I see him again for some fifteen or sixteen years.|1
wavs/3_33.wav|When he returned it was without warning, and I was much surprised to know that he had not aged apparently a moment,|1
wavs/3_34.wav|nor had he changed in any other way.|1
wavs/3_35.wav|He was, when the others were with him, the same genial happy fellow we had known of old,|1
wavs/3_36.wav|but when he thought himself alone I have seen him sit for hours gazing off into space,|1
wavs/3_37.wav|his face sad in a look of wistful longing and hopeless misery,|1
wavs/3_38.wav|and at night he would sit thus looking up into the heavens|1
wavs/3_39.wav|at what I did not know until I read his manuscript years afterward.|1
wavs/3_40.wav|He told us that he had been prospecting and mining in Arizona,|1
wavs/3_41.wav|part of the time since the war, and that he had been very successful was evidenced by the unlimited amount of money with which he was supplied.|1
wavs/3_42.wav|As to the details of his life during these years he was very reticent, in fact he would not talk of them at all.|1
wavs/3_43.wav|He remained with us for about a year, and then went to New York where he purchased a little place on the Hudson,|1
wavs/3_44.wav|where I visited him once a year on the occasions of my trips to the New York market,|1
wavs/3_45.wav|my father and I owning and operating a string of general stores throughout Virginia at that time.|1
wavs/3_46.wav|Captain Carter had a small but beautiful cottage situated on a bluff overlooking the river,|1
wavs/3_47.wav|and during one of my last visits in the winter of 1895 I observed he was much occupied in writing, I presume now upon this manuscript.|1
wavs/3_48.wav|He told me at this time that if anything should happen to him he wished me to take charge of his estate.|1
wavs/3_49.wav|And he gave me a key to a compartment in the safe which stood in his study, telling me I would find his will there,|1
wavs/3_50.wav|and some personal instructions which he had me pledge myself to carry out with absolute fidelity.|1
wavs/3_51.wav|After I had retired for the night I have seen him from my window standing in the moonlight on the brink of the bluff overlooking the Hudson with his arms stretched out to the heavens as though in appeal.|1
wavs/3_52.wav|I thought at the time that he was praying, although I never understood that he was, in the strict sense of the term, a religious man.|1
wavs/3_53.wav|Several months after I had returned home from my last visit, the first March of 1886, I think, I received a telegram from him asking me to come to him at once.|1
wavs/3_54.wav|I had always been his favorite among the younger generations of Carters, and so I hastened to comply with his demand.|1
wavs/3_55.wav|I arrived at the little station about a mile from his grounds on the morning of March 4th, 1886, and when I asked the liveryman to drive me out to the captain Carters, he replied that if I was a friend of the captain's he had some very bad news for me.|1
wavs/3_56.wav|The captain had been found dead shortly after daylight, that very morning by the watchman attached to an adjoining property.|1
wavs/3_57.wav|For some reason this news did not surprise me, but I hurried out to his place as quickly as possible so that I could take charge of the body and of his affairs.|1
wavs/3_58.wav|I found the watchman who had discovered him, together with the local police chief and several townspeople assembled in his little study.|1
wavs/3_59.wav|The watchman related a few details connected with the finding of the body, which he said had still been warm when he came upon it.|1
wavs/3_60.wav|It lay, he said, stretched full length in the snow, with the arms outstretched above the head, toward the edge of the bluff, and when he showed me the spot it flashed upon me that it was the identical one where I had seen him on those other nights, with his arms raised in supplication to the skies.|1
wavs/3_61.wav|There were no marks of violence on the body, and with the aid of a local physician the cronist jury quickly reached a decision of death from heart failure.|1
wavs/3_62.wav|Left alone in the study I opened the safe and withdrew the contents of the drawer in which he had told me I would find my instructions.|1
wavs/3_63.wav|They were in part peculiar indeed, but I have followed them to each last detail as faithfully as I was able.|1
wavs/3_64.wav|He directed that I remove his body to Virginia without embalming, and that he be laid in an open coffin within a tomb which he previously had had constructed, and which, as I later learned, was well ventilated.|1
wavs/3_65.wav|The instructions impressed upon me that I must personally see that this was carried out just as he directed, even in secrecy if necessary.|1
wavs/3_66.wav|His property was left in such a way that I was to receive the entire income for twenty-five years when the principal was to become mine.|1
wavs/3_67.wav|His further instructions related to his manuscript which I was to retain sealed and unread just as I found it for eleven years, nor was I to divulge its contents until twenty-one years after his death.|1
wavs/3_68.wav|A strange feature about the tomb, where his body still lies, is that the massive door is equipped with a single huge gold-plated spring lock which can be opened only from the inside.|1
wavs/3_69.wav|Yours very sincerely, Edgar Rice Burroughs|1
wavs/4_0.wav|CHAPTER XIII.|1
wavs/4_1.wav|LOVE-MAKING ON MARS.|1
wavs/4_2.wav|Following the battle with the airships, the community remained within the city for several|1
wavs/4_3.wav|days, abandoning the homeward march until they could feel reasonably assured that the|1
wavs/4_4.wav|ships would not return. For to be caught on the open plains with a cavalcade of chariots|1
wavs/4_5.wav|and children was far from the desire of even so warlike a people as the green Martians.|1
wavs/4_6.wav|During our period of inactivity, Tas Takas had instructed me in many of the customs and arts of|1
wavs/4_7.wav|war familiar to the Thargs, including lessons in riding and guiding the great beasts which|1
wavs/4_8.wav|bore the warriors. These creatures, which are known as Thoats, are as dangerous and vicious|1
wavs/4_9.wav|as their masters, but when once subdued are sufficiently tractable for the purpose of the|1
wavs/4_10.wav|green Martians. Two of these animals had fallen to me from the warriors whose metal I wore,|1
wavs/4_11.wav|and in a short time I could handle them quite as well as the native warriors. The method was not|1
wavs/4_12.wav|at all complicated. If the Thoats did not respond with sufficient celerity to the telepathic|1
wavs/4_13.wav|instructions of their masters, they were dealt a terrific blow between the ears with the butt|1
wavs/4_14.wav|of a pistol, and if they showed fight this treatment was continued until the brutes either|1
wavs/4_15.wav|were subdued or had unseated their riders. In the latter case it became a life-and-death struggle|1
wavs/4_16.wav|between the man and the beast. If the former were quick enough with a pistol he might live to ride|1
wavs/4_17.wav|again, though upon some other beast. If not, his torn and mangled body was gassed up by his women|1
wavs/4_18.wav|and burned in accordance with Tharkian custom. My experience with Wula determined me to attempt|1
wavs/4_19.wav|the experiment of kindness in my treatment of my Thoats. First I taught them that they could not|1
wavs/4_20.wav|unseat me, and even rep them sharply between the ears to impress upon them my authority and mastery.|1
wavs/4_21.wav|Then by degree I won their confidence in much the same manner as I had adopted countestimes|1
wavs/4_22.wav|with my many mundane mounts. I was ever a good hand with animals, and by inclination,|1
wavs/4_23.wav|as well as because it brought more lasting and satisfactory results, I was always kind and|1
wavs/4_24.wav|humane in my dealings with the lower orders. I could take a human life if necessary with far less|1
wavs/4_25.wav|compunction than that of a poor, unreasoning, irresponsible brute. In the course of a few days|1
wavs/4_26.wav|my Thoats were the oneness of the entire community. They would follow me like dogs,|1
wavs/4_27.wav|rubbing their great snouts against my body in awkward evidence of affection, and respond to|1
wavs/4_28.wav|my every command with an alacrity and docetity which caused the Martian warriors to ascribe to|1
wavs/4_29.wav|me the possession of some earthly power unknown on Mars.|1
wavs/4_30.wav|"'How have you bewitched them?' asked Tars Tarkas one afternoon, when he had seen me run my arm far|1
wavs/4_31.wav|between the grey jaws of one of my throats, which had wedged a piece of stone between two of his|1
wavs/4_32.wav|teeth while feeding upon the moss-like vegetation within our courtyard.|1
wavs/4_33.wav|"'By kindness,' I replied,|1
wavs/4_34.wav|"'you see, Tars Tarkas, the softer sentiments have their value, even to a warrior. In the height of|1
wavs/4_35.wav|a battle as well as upon the march, I know that my throats will obey my every command, and therefore|1
wavs/4_36.wav|my fighting efficiency is enhanced, and I am a better warrior for the reason that I am a kind|1
wavs/4_37.wav|master. Your other warriors would find it to the advantage of themselves as well as of the|1
wavs/4_38.wav|community to adopt my method in this respect. Only a few days since, you yourself told me that|1
wavs/4_39.wav|these great brutes, by the uncertainty of their tempers, often were the means of turning victory|1
wavs/4_40.wav|into defeat, since, at a crucial moment, they might elect to unseat and rend their riders.'|1
wavs/4_41.wav|"'Show me how you accomplish these results,' was Tars Tarkas' only rejoinder.|1
wavs/4_42.wav|And so I explained as carefully as I could the entire method of training I had adopted with my|1
wavs/4_43.wav|beasts, and later he had me repeat it before Lorcas Ptomel and the assembled warriors.|1
wavs/4_44.wav|That moment marked the beginning of a new existence for the poor thotes,|1
wavs/4_45.wav|and before the lefty community of Lorcas Ptomel I had the satisfaction of observing a regiment|1
wavs/4_46.wav|of extractable and docile moans as one might care to see. The effect on the precision and|1
wavs/4_47.wav|celerity of the military movements was so remarkable that Lorcas Ptomel presented me|1
wavs/4_48.wav|with a massive anklet of gold from his own leg as a sign of his appreciation of my service to the|1
wavs/4_49.wav|horde. On the seventh day following the battle with the aircraft we again took up the march|1
wavs/4_50.wav|toward Thark, all probability of another attack being deemed remote by Lorcas Ptomel.|1
wavs/4_51.wav|During the days just preceding our departure I had seen but little of Dejatoris,|1
wavs/4_52.wav|as I had been kept very busy by Tarstakus with my lessons in the art of Martian warfare,|1
wavs/4_53.wav|as well as in the training of my thotes. The few times I had visited her quarters she had been|1
wavs/4_54.wav|absent, walking upon the streets with Sola, or investigating the building in the near vicinity|1
wavs/4_55.wav|of the plaza. I had warned them against venturing far from the plaza for fear of the great white|1
wavs/4_56.wav|apes, whose ferocity I was only too well acquainted with. However, since Wooler accompanied them on|1
wavs/4_57.wav|all their excursions, and as Sola was well armed, there was competitively little cause for fear.|1
wavs/4_58.wav|On the evening before our departure I saw them approaching along one of the great avenues which|1
wavs/4_59.wav|lead into the plaza from the east. I advanced to meet them, and telling Sola that I would take the|1
wavs/4_60.wav|responsibility for Dejatoris' safekeeping, I directed her to return to her quarters on some|1
wavs/4_61.wav|trivial errand. I liked and trusted Sola, but for some reason I desired to be alone with Dejatoris,|1
wavs/4_62.wav|who represented to me all that I had left behind upon earth, an agreeable and congenial companionship.|1
wavs/4_63.wav|There seemed bonds of mutual interest between us, as powerful as though we had been born under the|1
wavs/4_64.wav|same roof rather than upon different planets hurtling through space some forty-eight million|1
wavs/4_65.wav|miles apart. That she shared my sentiments in this respect I was positive, for in my approach|1
wavs/4_66.wav|the look of pitiful hopelessness left her sweet countenance to be replaced by a smile of joyful|1
wavs/4_67.wav|welcome, as she placed her little right hand upon my left shoulder in true red Martian salute.|1
wavs/4_68.wav|Sarkoja told Sola that you had become a true Thark, she said, and that I would now see no more of you|1
wavs/4_69.wav|than any of the other warriors. Sarkoja is a liar of the first magnitude, I replied,|1
wavs/4_70.wav|notwithstanding the proud claim of the Tharks to absolute verity. Dejatoris laughed. I knew that|1
wavs/4_71.wav|even though you became a member of the community, you would not cease to be my friend. A warrior|1
wavs/4_72.wav|may change his metal, but not his heart, as the saying is upon Barasun. I think they have been|1
wavs/4_73.wav|trying to keep us apart, she continued, for whenever you have been off duty. One of the|1
wavs/4_74.wav|older women of Tars Tharkas' retinue has always arranged to trump up some excuse to get Sola and|1
wavs/4_75.wav|me out of sight. They have had me down in the pits below the buildings, helping them mix their awful|1
wavs/4_76.wav|radium powder and make their terrible projectiles. You know that these have to be manufactured by|1
wavs/4_77.wav|artificial light, as exposure to sunlight always results in an explosion. You have noticed that|1
wavs/4_78.wav|their bullets explode when they strike an object? Well, the opaque outer coating is broken by the|1
wavs/4_79.wav|impact exposing a glass cylinder, almost solid, in the forward end of which is a minute particle|1
wavs/4_80.wav|of radium powder. The moment the sunlight, even though diffused, strikes this powder,|1
wavs/4_81.wav|it explodes with a violence which nothing can withstand. If you ever witness a night battle,|1
wavs/4_82.wav|you will note the absence of these explosions, while the morning following the battle will be|1
wavs/4_83.wav|filled at sunrise with the sharp detonations of exploding missiles fired the preceding night.|1
wavs/4_84.wav|As a rule, however, non-exploding projectiles are used at night.|1
wavs/4_85.wav|While I was much interested in Deshatoris' explanation of this wonderful adjunct to Martian|1
wavs/4_86.wav|warfare, I was more concerned by the immediate problem of their treatment of her. That they were|1
wavs/4_87.wav|keeping her away from me was not a matter for surprise, but they should subject her to dangers|1
wavs/4_88.wav|in Arge's labor filled me with rage. Have they ever subjected you to cruelty and ignominy, Deshatoris?|1
wavs/4_89.wav|I asked, feeling the hot blood of my fighting ancestor leap in my veins, as I awaited her reply.|1
wavs/4_90.wav|Only a little ways, John Carter, she answered. Nothing that can harm me outside my pride.|1
wavs/4_91.wav|They know that I am the daughter of ten thousand jeddaks, that I trace my ancestry straight back|1
wavs/4_92.wav|without a break to the builder of the first great waterway, and they who do not even know their own|1
wavs/4_93.wav|mothers are jealous of me. At heart they hate their horrid fates, and so wreck their poor spite|1
wavs/4_94.wav|on me, who stand for everything they have not, and for all they most crave and never can attain.|1
wavs/4_95.wav|Let us pity them, my chieftain, for even though we die at their hands, we can afford them pity,|1
wavs/4_96.wav|since we are greater than they, and they know it. Had I known the significance of these words,|1
wavs/4_97.wav|my chieftain, as applied by red Martian woman to a man, I should have had the surprise of my life,|1
wavs/4_98.wav|but I did not know at that time, nor for many months thereafter. Yes, I still had much to learn|1
wavs/4_99.wav|upon Barsoom. I presume it is the better part of wisdom that we bow to our fate with as good grace|1
wavs/4_100.wav|as possible, Deshatoris. But I hope nevertheless that I may be present the next time that any|1
wavs/4_101.wav|Martian, green, red, pink, or violet, has the temerity to even so much as frown on you, my|1
wavs/4_102.wav|princess." Deshatoris caught her breath at my last word, and gazed upon me with dilated eyes and|1
wavs/4_103.wav|quickening breath, and then with an odd little laugh, which brought roguish dimples to the|1
wavs/4_104.wav|corners of her mouth, she shook her head and cried, "'What a child! A great warrior, and yet a stumbling|1
wavs/4_105.wav|little child!' "'What have I done now?' I asked in sore perplexity. "'Some day you shall know,|1
wavs/4_106.wav|John Carter, if we live. But I may not tell you. And I, the daughter of Moscajac, son of Tar-Romor,|1
wavs/4_107.wav|have listened without anger.' She soliloquised in conclusion. Then she broke out again into one of|1
wavs/4_108.wav|her gay, happy, laughing moods, joking with me on my prose as a Thark warrior, as contrasted with my|1
wavs/4_109.wav|soft heart and natural kindliness. "'I presume that should you accidentally wound an enemy,|1
wavs/4_110.wav|you would take him home and nurse him back to health,' she laughed.|1
wavs/4_111.wav|"'That is precisely what we do on earth,' I answered, at least among civilized men.|1
wavs/4_112.wav|This made her laugh again. She could not understand it, for with all her tenderness|1
wavs/4_113.wav|and womanly sweetness, she was still a Martian. And to a Martian, the only good enemy is a dead|1
wavs/4_114.wav|enemy, for every dead foeman means so much more to divide between those who live.|1
wavs/4_115.wav|"'I was very curious to know what I had said or done to cause her so much perturbation|1
wavs/4_116.wav|among me before, and so I continued to importune her to enlighten me.'|1
wavs/4_117.wav|"'No,' she exclaimed. "'It is enough that you have said it, and that I have listened.|1
wavs/4_118.wav|And when you learn, John Carter, and if I be dead, it is likely I shall be ere the further moon has|1
wavs/4_119.wav|circled Barsoom another twelve times, remember that I have listened, and that I smiled.'|1
wavs/4_120.wav|"'It was all Greek to me. But the more I begged her to explain, the more positive became her|1
wavs/4_121.wav|denials of my request, and so, in very hopelessness, I desisted.|1
wavs/4_122.wav|"'Day had now given way to night, and as we wandered along the great avenue,|1
wavs/4_123.wav|lighted by the two moons of Barsoom, and with earth looking down upon us,|1
wavs/4_124.wav|a deferred luminous green eye, it seemed that we were alone in the universe.|1
wavs/4_125.wav|And I at least was content that it should be so.|1
wavs/4_126.wav|"'The chill of the Martian night was upon us, and removing my silks, I threw them across the|1
wavs/4_127.wav|shoulders of Desha Taurus. As my arm rested for an instant upon her, I felt a thrill pass through|1
wavs/4_128.wav|every fibre of my being, such as contact with no other mortal had even produced. And it seemed to|1
wavs/4_129.wav|me that she had leaned slightly toward me. But of that I was not sure. Only I knew that,|1
wavs/4_130.wav|as my arm rested there across her shoulders longer than the act of adjusting the silk required,|1
wavs/4_131.wav|she did not draw away, nor did she speak. And so, in silence, we walked the surface of a dying world,|1
wavs/4_132.wav|but in the breast of one of us at least had been born that which is ever oldest yet ever new.|1
wavs/4_133.wav|I loved Desha Taurus. The touch of my arm upon her naked shoulder had spoken to me in words I|1
wavs/4_134.wav|would not mistake, and I knew that I had loved her since the first moment that my eyes had met|1
wavs/4_135.wav|hers that first time in the plaza of the dead city of Korad." End of chapter 13|1

wavs/5_3.wav|The Princess of Mars by Edgar R. Burroughs|1
wavs/5_4.wav|Chapter 23 Lost in the Sky|1
wavs/5_5.wav|Without effort at concealment, I hastened to the vicinity of our quarters,|1
wavs/5_6.wav|where I felt sure I would find Kantos Khan.|1
wavs/5_7.wav|As I neared the building, I became more careful as I judged, and rightly, that the place would be guarded.|1
wavs/5_8.wav|Several men in civilian metal loitered near the front entrance, and in the rear were others.|1
wavs/5_9.wav|My only means of reaching, unseen the upper story, where our apartments were situated,|1
wavs/5_10.wav|was through an adjoining building, and after considerable maneuvering,|1
wavs/5_11.wav|I managed to attain the roof of a shop several doors away.|1
wavs/5_12.wav|Leaping from roof to roof, I soon reached an open window in the building where I hoped to|1
wavs/5_13.wav|find the Heliumite, and in another moment, I stood in the room before him.|1
wavs/5_14.wav|He was alone and showed no surprise at my coming, saying he had expected me much earlier,|1
wavs/5_15.wav|as my tour of duty must have ended some time since.|1
wavs/5_16.wav|I saw that he knew nothing of the events of the day at the palace, and when I had|1
wavs/5_17.wav|enlightened him, he was all excitement. The news that Dejatoris had promised her hand to Sarpthane|1
wavs/5_18.wav|filled him with dismay.|1
wavs/5_19.wav|It cannot be, he exclaimed. It is impossible.|1
wavs/5_20.wav|Why, no man in all Helium but would prefer death to the selling of our|1
wavs/5_21.wav|loved princess to the ruling house of Zodanga.|1
wavs/5_22.wav|She must have lost her mind to have assented to such an atrocious bargain.|1
wavs/5_23.wav|You, who do not know how we of Helium love the members of our ruling house,|1
wavs/5_24.wav|cannot appreciate the horror with which I contemplate such an unholy alliance.|1
wavs/5_25.wav|What can be done, John Carter? He continued.|1
wavs/5_26.wav|You are a resourceful man. Can you not think of some way to save Helium from this disgrace?|1
wavs/5_27.wav|If I can come within Swart's reach of Sarpthane, I answered, I can solve the difficulty,|1
wavs/5_28.wav|and so far as Helium is concerned, but for personal reasons, I would prefer that another|1
wavs/5_29.wav|struck the blow that frees Dejatoris.|1
wavs/5_30.wav|Kantos Khan eyed me narrowly before he spoke.|1
wavs/5_31.wav|You love her, he said. Does she know it?|1
wavs/5_32.wav|She knows it, Kantos Khan, and repulses me only because she is promised to Sarpthane.|1
wavs/5_33.wav|The splendid fellow sprang to his feet, and grasping me by the shoulders,|1
wavs/5_34.wav|raised his sword on high, exclaiming,|1
wavs/5_35.wav|And had the choice been left to me, I could not have chosen a more fitting mate for the|1
wavs/5_36.wav|first princess of Barsoom.|1
wavs/5_37.wav|Here is my hand upon your shoulder, John Carter, and my word, that Sarpthane shall go out at the|1
wavs/5_38.wav|point of my sword for the sake of my love for Helium, for Dejatoris, and for you.|1
wavs/5_39.wav|This very night I shall try to reach his quarters in the palace.|1
wavs/5_40.wav|How? I asked.|1
wavs/5_41.wav|You are strongly guarded, and a quadruple force patrols the sky.|1
wavs/5_42.wav|He bent his head in thought a moment, and raised it with an air of confidence.|1
wavs/5_43.wav|I only need to pass these guards, and I can do it, he said at last.|1
wavs/5_44.wav|I know a secret entrance to the palace through the pinnacle of the highest tower.|1
wavs/5_45.wav|I fell upon it by chance one day as I was passing above the palace on patrol duty.|1
wavs/5_46.wav|In this work it is required that we investigate any unusual occurrence we may witness,|1
wavs/5_47.wav|and a face peering from the pinnacle of the high tower of the palace was, to me, most unusual.|1
wavs/5_48.wav|I therefore drew nearer, and discovered that the possessor of the peering face was none other than|1
wavs/5_49.wav|Sarpthane. He was slightly put out at being detected, and commanded me to keep the matter|1
wavs/5_50.wav|to myself, explaining that the passage from the tower led directly to his apartments,|1
wavs/5_51.wav|and was known only to him. If I can reach the roof of the barracks,|1
wavs/5_52.wav|and get my machine, I can be in Sarpthane's quarters in five minutes.|1
wavs/5_53.wav|But how am I to escape from this building, guarded as you say it is?|1
wavs/5_54.wav|How well are the machines, sherds, at the barracks guarded? I asked.|1
wavs/5_55.wav|There is usually but one man on duty there at night upon the roof.|1
wavs/5_56.wav|Go to the roof of this building, Kantuskan, and wait me there.|1
wavs/5_57.wav|Without stopping to explain my plans, I retracted my way to the street, and hastened to the barracks.|1
wavs/5_58.wav|I did not dare to enter the building, filled as it was with members of the air-scout squadron,|1
wavs/5_59.wav|who, in common with all Zodanga, were on the lookout for me.|1
wavs/5_60.wav|The building was an enormous one, rearing its lofty head fully a thousand feet into the air.|1
wavs/5_61.wav|But few buildings in Zodanga were higher than these barracks, though several topped it by a|1
wavs/5_62.wav|few hundred feet, the docks of the great battleships of the line standing some fifteen|1
wavs/5_63.wav|hundred feet from the ground, while the frightened passenger stations of the merchant squadrons rose|1
wavs/5_64.wav|nearly as high. It was a long climb up the face of the building, and one fought with much danger,|1
wavs/5_65.wav|but there was no other way, and so I assayed the task.|1
wavs/5_66.wav|The fact that Barsoomian architecture is extremely ornate made the feat much simpler than I had|1
wavs/5_67.wav|anticipated, since I found ornamental ledges and projections which fairly formed the perfect|1
wavs/5_68.wav|ladder for me all the way to the eaves of the building. Here I met my first real obstacle.|1
wavs/5_69.wav|The eaves projected nearly twenty feet from the wall to which I clung, and though I encircled the|1
wavs/5_70.wav|great building, I could find no opening through them. The top floor was alight, and filled with|1
wavs/5_71.wav|soldiers engaged in the pastimes of their kind. I could not therefore reach the roof from this|1
wavs/5_72.wav|building. There was one slight desperate chance, and that I decided I must take. It was for Dejatoris,|1
wavs/5_73.wav|and no man has lived who would not risk a thousand deaths for such as she. Clinging to the wall with|1
wavs/5_74.wav|my feet and one hand, I unloosened one of the long leather straps of my trappings, at the end of which|1
wavs/5_75.wav|dangled the great hook by which air-sailors are hung to the sides and bottoms of their craft for|1
wavs/5_76.wav|various purposes of repair, and by means of which landing-parties are lowered to the ground from the|1
wavs/5_77.wav|battleships. I swung this hook cautiously to the roof several times before it finally found|1
wavs/5_78.wav|lodgement. Gently I pulled on it to strengthen its hold. But whether it would bear the weight of my|1
wavs/5_79.wav|body I did not know. It might be barely caught upon the very outer verge of the roof, so that|1
wavs/5_80.wav|as my body swung out at the end of the strap it would slip off and launch me to the pavement a|1
wavs/5_81.wav|thousand feet below. An instant I hesitated, and then, releasing my grasp upon the supporting|1
wavs/5_82.wav|ornament, I swung out into space at the end of the strap. Far below me lay the brilliantly lighted|1
wavs/5_83.wav|streets, the hard pavements, and death. There was a little jerk at the top of the supporting eaves,|1
wavs/5_84.wav|and a nasty slipping, grating sound which turned me cold with apprehension. Then the hook caught,|1
wavs/5_85.wav|and I was safe. Clambering quickly aloft, I grasped the edge of the eaves and drew myself|1
wavs/5_86.wav|to the surface of the roof above. As I gained my feet I was confronted by the sentry on duty.|1
wavs/5_87.wav|Into the muscle of whose revolver I found myself looking.|1
wavs/5_88.wav|Who are you? And whence came you? He cried.|1
wavs/5_89.wav|I am an elscout, friend, and very near to Detmon, for just by the merest chance I escaped falling to the avenue below, I replied.|1
wavs/5_90.wav|But how came you upon the roof, man? No one has landed or come up from the building for the past hour.|1
wavs/5_91.wav|Quick, explain yourself or I call the guard. Look you here, sentry, and you shall see how I came,|1
wavs/5_92.wav|and how close the shave I had not to coming at all, I answered, turning toward the edge of the roof,|1
wavs/5_93.wav|where twenty feet below, at the end of my strap, hung all my weapons. The fellow, acting on impulse|1
wavs/5_94.wav|of curiosity, stepped to my side, and to his undoing, for as he leaned to peer over the eaves,|1
wavs/5_95.wav|I grasped him by his throat and his pistol arm, and threw him heavily to the roof. The weapon|1
wavs/5_96.wav|dropped from his grasp, and my fingers choked off his attempted cry for assistance. I gagged,|1
wavs/5_97.wav|and bound him, and then hung him over the edge of the roof, as I myself had hung a few moments before.|1
wavs/5_98.wav|I knew it would be morning before he would be discovered, and I needed all the time that I could gain.|1
wavs/5_99.wav|Donning my trappings and weapons, I hastened to the sheds, and soon head out both my machine and|1
wavs/5_100.wav|Kantor's khans. Making his fast behind mine, I started my engine. Skimming over the edge of the roof,|1
wavs/5_101.wav|I dove down into the streets of the city far below the plain, usually occupied by the air patrol.|1
wavs/5_102.wav|In less than a minute, I was settling safely upon the roof of our apartment, beside the atonished|1
wavs/5_103.wav|Kantor's Khan. I lost no time in explanation, but plunged immediately into a discussion of our plans|1
wavs/5_104.wav|for the immediate future. It was decided that I was to try to make Helium, while Kantor's Khan was to|1
wavs/5_105.wav|enter the palace and dispatch Sapsan. If successful, he was then to follow me. He set my compass for me,|1
wavs/5_106.wav|a clever little device, which will remain steadfastly fixed upon any given point on the|1
wavs/5_107.wav|surface of Barsoom, and bidding each other farewell, we rose together and sped in the|1
wavs/5_108.wav|direction of the place which lay in the route which I must take to reach Helium.|1
wavs/5_109.wav|As we neared the high tower, a patrol shot down from above, throwing its piercing searchlight|1
wavs/5_110.wav|fully upon my craft, and a voice roared out in command to haught, following with a shot as I|1
wavs/5_111.wav|paid no attention to his hail. Kantor's Khan dropped quickly into the darkness, while I rose steadily|1
wavs/5_112.wav|and at a terrific speed raced through the Martian sky, followed by a dozen of the airscout craft,|1
wavs/5_113.wav|which had joined the pursuit, and later by a swift cruiser carrying a hundred men and a battery of|1
wavs/5_114.wav|rapid-fired guns. By twisting and turning my little machine, now rising, now falling, I managed to|1
wavs/5_115.wav|elude their searchlights most of the time, but I was also losing ground by these tactics, and so|1
wavs/5_116.wav|I decided to hazard everything on a straightaway course and leave the result to fate and the speed|1
wavs/5_117.wav|of my machine. Kantor's Khan had shown me the trick of gearing, which is known only to the Navy of Helium,|1
wavs/5_118.wav|that greatly increases the speed of our machines, so that I felt sure I could distance my pursuers|1
wavs/5_119.wav|if I could dodge their projectiles for a few moments. As I sped through the air, the screeching|1
wavs/5_120.wav|of the bullets around me convinced me that only by miracle could I escape, but the die was cased,|1
wavs/5_121.wav|and throwing on full speed I raced straight course towards Helium. Gradually I left my pursuers further|1
wavs/5_122.wav|and further behind, and was just congratulating myself on my lucky escape, when a well-directed|1
wavs/5_123.wav|shot from the cruiser exploded at the prow of my little craft. The concussion nearly capsized her,|1
wavs/5_124.wav|and with a sickening plunge she hurtled downward through the dark night. How far I fell before I|1
wavs/5_125.wav|regained control of the plane I do not know, but I must have been very close to the ground when I|1
wavs/5_126.wav|started to rise again, as I plainly heard the squealing of animals below me. Rising again, I|1
wavs/5_127.wav|scanned the heavens for my pursuers, and finally making out their lights far behind me, saw that|1
wavs/5_128.wav|they were landing, evidently in search of me. Not until their lights were no longer discernible did|1
wavs/5_129.wav|I venture to flash my little lamp upon my compass, and then I found to my consternation that a|1
wavs/5_130.wav|fragment of the projectile had utterly destroyed my only guide, as well as my speedometer. It was|1
wavs/5_131.wav|true, I could follow the stars in the general direction of Helium, but without knowing the exact|1
wavs/5_132.wav|location of the city, or the speed at which I was traveling, my chances for finding it were slim.|1
wavs/5_133.wav|Helium lies a thousand miles southwest of Zodanger, and with my compass intact I should have made the|1
wavs/5_134.wav|trip, bearing accidents in between four or five hours. As it turned out, however, morning found me|1
wavs/5_135.wav|speeding over a vast expanse of dead sea bottom after nearly six hours of continuous flight at|1
wavs/5_136.wav|high speed. Presently a great city showed below me, but it was not Helium, as that alone of all|1
wavs/5_137.wav|basumium metropolises consists in two immense circular wall cities about 75 miles apart,|1
wavs/5_138.wav|and would have been easily distinguishable from the altitude at which I was flying.|1
wavs/5_139.wav|Believed that I had come too far to the north and west, I turned back in a thous-easterly direction,|1
wavs/5_140.wav|passing during the forenoon several other large cities, but non-resembling the description which|1
wavs/5_141.wav|Kantus Kan had given me of Helium. In addition to the twin city formation of Helium, another|1
wavs/5_142.wav|distinguishing feature is the two immense towers, one of vivid scarlet rising nearly a mile into|1
wavs/5_143.wav|the air from the center of one of the cities, while the other, of bright yellow and of the same height,|1
wavs/5_144.wav|marks her sister. End of chapter 23|1

wavs/6_1.wav|This reading by Stefan MÃ¶bius, Edgar Rice Burroughs's The Princess of Mars, Chapter 28, At the Arizona Cave.|1
wavs/6_2.wav|It was dark when I opened my eyes again. Strange, stiff garments were upon my body. Garments that cracked and powdered away from me as I rose to sitting posture.|1
wavs/6_3.wav|I felt myself over from head to foot, and from head to foot I was clothed. Though when I fell unconscious at the little doorway I had been naked.|1
wavs/6_4.wav|Before me was a small patch of moonlit sky which showed through a ragged aperture. As my hands passed over my body they came in contact with pockets, and in one of these a small parcel of mattress wrapped in oiled paper.|1
wavs/6_5.wav|One of these mattresses struck and its dim flame lighted up what appeared to be a huge cave, toward the back of which I discovered a strange, still figure huddled over a tiny bench.|1
wavs/6_6.wav|As I approached it I saw it was the dead and mummified remains of a little old woman with long black hair, and the thing it leaned over was a small charcoal burner upon which rested a round copper vessel containing a small quantity of greenish powder.|1
wavs/6_7.wav|Behind her, depending from the roof upon rawhide thongs and stretching entirely across the cave, was a row of human skeletons.|1
wavs/6_8.wav|From the thong which held them stretched another to the dead hand of the little old woman. As I touched the cord the skeletons swung to the motion with a noise as of the rustling of dry leaves.|1
wavs/6_9.wav|It was a most grotesque and horrid tableau, and I hastened out into the fresh air, glad to escape from so gruesome a place.|1
wavs/6_10.wav|The sight that met my eyes as I stepped out upon a small ledge which ran before the entrance of the cave filled me with consternation.|1
wavs/6_11.wav|A new heaven and a new landscape made my gaze. The silvered mountains in the distance, the almost stationary moon hanging in the sky, the cacti-studded valley below me were not of Mars.|1
wavs/6_12.wav|I could scarcely believe my eyes, but the truth slowly forced itself upon me. I was looking upon Arizona from the same ledge from which ten years before I had gazed with longing upon Mars.|1
wavs/6_13.wav|Burying my head in my arms I turned, broken, sorrowful, down the trail from the cave.|1
wavs/6_14.wav|Above me shone the red eyes of Mars holding her awful secret 48 million miles away.|1
wavs/6_15.wav|Did the Martians reach the palm broom? Did the vitalizing air reach the people of that distant planet in time to save them?|1
wavs/6_16.wav|Was my desert Taurus alive? Or did her beautiful body lie cold in death beside the tiny golden incubator in the sunken garden of the inner courtyard of the palace of Tardor Mor, the Jeddak of Helium?|1
wavs/6_17.wav|For ten years I have waited and prayed for an answer to my questions. For ten years I have waited and prayed to be taken back to the world of my lost love.|1
wavs/6_18.wav|I would rather lie dead beside her there than live on earth all those millions of terrible miles from her.|1
wavs/6_19.wav|The old mine, which I found untouched, has made me fabulously wealthy, but what care I for wealth?|1
wavs/6_20.wav|As I sit here tonight in my little study overlooking the Hudson, just twenty years have elapsed since I first opened my eyes upon Mars.|1
wavs/6_21.wav|I can see her shining in the sky through the little window by my desk. And tonight she seems calling to me again, as she has not called before since that long dead night.|1
wavs/6_22.wav|And I think I can see across that awful abyss of space a beautiful black-haired woman standing in the garden of her palace.|1
wavs/6_23.wav|And at her side is a little boy who puts his arm around her as she points into the sky towards the plant earth while at their feet is a hideous creature with a heart of gold.|1
wavs/6_24.wav|I believe that they are waiting there for me. And something tells me that I shall soon know.|1

wavs/7_1.wav|THE EVE OF THE WAR|1
wavs/7_2.wav|But who shall dwell in these worlds if they be inhabited? Are we or they lords of the world?|1
wavs/7_3.wav|And how are all things made for men? Kepler, Quoted in the Anatomy of Melancholy.|1
wavs/7_4.wav|No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being|1
wavs/7_5.wav|watched, keenly and closely, by intelligences greater than men's, and yet as mortal as his own.|1
wavs/7_6.wav|That as men busied themselves about their various concerns, they were scrutinized and studied,|1
wavs/7_7.wav|perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient|1
wavs/7_8.wav|creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency,|1
wavs/7_9.wav|men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of|1
wavs/7_10.wav|their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same.|1
wavs/7_11.wav|No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of|1
wavs/7_12.wav|them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall|1
wavs/7_13.wav|some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most, terrestrial men fancied there might be|1
wavs/7_14.wav|other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise yet|1
wavs/7_15.wav|across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that|1
wavs/7_16.wav|perish. Intellects, vast and cool and un-thimpathetic, regarded this earth with envious|1
wavs/7_17.wav|eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century|1
wavs/7_18.wav|came the great disillusionment. The planet Mars, as scarcely neat remind the reader, revolves about|1
wavs/7_19.wav|the Sun at a mean distance of one hundred forty million miles, and the light and heat it receives|1
wavs/7_20.wav|from the Sun is barely half of that received by this world. It must be if the nebular hypothesis|1
wavs/7_21.wav|has any truth older than our world. And long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon|1
wavs/7_22.wav|its surface must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one-seventh of the volume of|1
wavs/7_23.wav|the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin. It has|1
wavs/7_24.wav|air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence. Yet so vain as|1
wavs/7_25.wav|man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer up to the very end of the nineteenth century|1
wavs/7_26.wav|expressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,|1
wavs/7_27.wav|beyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood that, since Mars is older than our|1
wavs/7_28.wav|Earth, with scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter from the Sun, it necessarily|1
wavs/7_29.wav|follows that it is not only more distant from time's beginning, but nearer its end. That last|1
wavs/7_30.wav|stage of exhaustion, which to us is still incredibly remote, has become a present-day|1
wavs/7_31.wav|problem for the inhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their|1
wavs/7_32.wav|intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And looking across space with|1
wavs/7_33.wav|instruments and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest|1
wavs/7_34.wav|distance only thirty-five millions of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own|1
wavs/7_35.wav|warmer planet, green with vegetation and gray with water, with a cloudy atmosphere, eloquent|1
wavs/7_36.wav|of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting cloud-bisps of broad stretches of populous country|1
wavs/7_37.wav|and narrow, navy-crowded seas. And we men, the creatures who inhabit this Earth, must be to them|1
wavs/7_38.wav|at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The intellectual side of man already|1
wavs/7_39.wav|admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is|1
wavs/7_40.wav|the belief of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling, and this world is still|1
wavs/7_41.wav|crowded with life, but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward|1
wavs/7_42.wav|is indeed their only escape from the destruction that generation after generation creeps upon them.|1
wavs/7_43.wav|And before we judge of them too harshly, we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction|1
wavs/7_44.wav|our own species has wrought, not only upon animals such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon|1
wavs/7_45.wav|its inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of|1
wavs/7_46.wav|existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants in the space of fifty years.|1
wavs/7_47.wav|Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?|1
wavs/7_48.wav|The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing subtlety. Their mathematical learning|1
wavs/7_49.wav|is evidently far in excess of ours, and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh|1
wavs/7_50.wav|perfect anonymity. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have seen the gathering trouble|1
wavs/7_51.wav|far back in the nineteenth century. Men like Chiaparelli watched the red planet. It is awed|1
wavs/7_52.wav|by the buy that for countless centuries Mars has been the star of war, but failed to interpret|1
wavs/7_53.wav|the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so well. All that time the Martians must|1
wavs/7_54.wav|have been getting ready. During the opposition of 1894, a great light was seen on the illuminated|1
wavs/7_55.wav|part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perotin of Nice, and then by other|1
wavs/7_56.wav|observers. English readers heard of it first in the Issue of Nature, dated August the second.|1
wavs/7_57.wav|I am inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun in the vast pit|1
wavs/7_58.wav|sunken to their planet, from which their shots were fired at us. Peculiar markings, as yet|1
wavs/7_59.wav|unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak during the next two oppositions.|1
wavs/7_60.wav|The storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached opposition, La Velle of Java set the|1
wavs/7_61.wav|wires of the astronomical exchange palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak|1
wavs/7_62.wav|of incandescent gas upon the planet. It had occurred towards midnight of the 12th, and the|1
wavs/7_63.wav|spectroscope to which he had at once resorted indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen,|1
wavs/7_64.wav|moving with an enormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of fire had become invisible|1
wavs/7_65.wav|about a quarter past 12. He compared it to a colossal puff of flame suddenly and violently|1
wavs/7_66.wav|squirted out of the planet as flaming gases rushed out of a gun. A singularly appropriate|1
wavs/7_67.wav|phrase, it proved. Yet the next day there was nothing of this in the papers except a little|1
wavs/7_68.wav|note in the Daily Telegraph, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest dangers that|1
wavs/7_69.wav|ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy,|1
wavs/7_70.wav|the well-known astronomer at Ottershaw. He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess|1
wavs/7_71.wav|of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a scrutiny of the red planet.|1
wavs/7_72.wav|In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vigil very distinctly. The black and|1
wavs/7_73.wav|silent observatory, the shadowed lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner,|1
wavs/7_74.wav|the steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in the roof,|1
wavs/7_75.wav|an oblong profundity with a stardust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved about, invisible but audible.|1
wavs/7_76.wav|Looking through the telescope one saw a circle of deep blue and a little round planet swimming in|1
wavs/7_77.wav|the field. It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and still faintly marked with|1
wavs/7_78.wav|transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round. But so little it was, so silvery|1
wavs/7_79.wav|warm, a pin's head of light. It was as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope|1
wavs/7_80.wav|vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view. As I watched,|1
wavs/7_81.wav|the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to advance and recede, but that was simply that|1
wavs/7_82.wav|my eye was tired. Forty millions of miles it was from us, more than forty millions of miles of void.|1
wavs/7_83.wav|Few people realized the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims.|1
wavs/7_84.wav|Near it in the field I remember were three faint points of light, three telescoping stars|1
wavs/7_85.wav|infinitely remote, and all around it was the unfathomable darkness of empty space.|1
wavs/7_86.wav|You know how that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night. In a telescope it seems far|1
wavs/7_87.wav|profounder and invisible to me because it was so remote and small, flying swiftly and steadily|1
wavs/7_88.wav|towards me. Across that incredible distance, drawing, nirva, every minute, by so many thousands|1
wavs/7_89.wav|of miles, came the thing they were sending us, the thing that was to bring so much struggle|1
wavs/7_90.wav|and calamity and death to the earth. I never dreamed of it then, as I watched. No one on|1
wavs/7_91.wav|earth dreamed of that unerring missile. That night too there was another jetting out of gas|1
wavs/7_92.wav|from the distant planet. I saw it, a reddish flash at the edge, the slightest projection of the|1
wavs/7_93.wav|outline, just as the chronometer struck midnight. And at that I told Ogilvy and he took my place.|1
wavs/7_94.wav|The night was warm and I was thirsty and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way|1
wavs/7_95.wav|in the darkness to the little table where the siphon stood while Ogilvy exclaimed at the stream|1
wavs/7_96.wav|of gas that came out towards us. That night another invisible missile started on its way to|1
wavs/7_97.wav|the earth from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first one. I remember|1
wavs/7_98.wav|how I sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my|1
wavs/7_99.wav|eyes. I wished I had a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute scream I had|1
wavs/7_100.wav|seen and all that it would presently bring me. Ogilvy watched till one and then gave it up,|1
wavs/7_101.wav|and we lit the lantern and walked over to his house. Down below in the darkness were|1
wavs/7_102.wav|Ottershaw and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people sleeping in peace.|1
wavs/7_103.wav|He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars and scoffed at the vulgar idea|1
wavs/7_104.wav|of its having inhabitants were signalling us. His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a|1
wavs/7_105.wav|heavy shower upon the planet or that a huge volcanic explosion was in progress. He pointed|1
wavs/7_106.wav|out to me how unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken the same direction in the|1
wavs/7_107.wav|two adjacent planets. The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one, he said.|1
wavs/7_108.wav|Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night, and the night after about midnight,|1
wavs/7_109.wav|and again the night after, and so for ten nights a flame each night.|1
wavs/7_110.wav|While the shots ceased after the intense, no one on earth has attempted to explain.|1
wavs/7_111.wav|It may be the gases of the firing caused the Martians inconvenience. Dense clouds of smoke|1
wavs/7_112.wav|or dust visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little gray fluctuating patches spread|1
wavs/7_113.wav|through the clearness of the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features.|1
wavs/7_114.wav|Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and popular notes appeared here and|1
wavs/7_115.wav|there and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon Mars. The seriocomic, periodical punch,|1
wavs/7_116.wav|I remember, made a happy use of it in the political cartoon. And all unsuspected, those missiles the|1
wavs/7_117.wav|Martians had fired at us grew earthward, rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the|1
wavs/7_118.wav|empty gulf of space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and nearer. It seems to me now almost|1
wavs/7_119.wav|incredibly wonderful that with that swift fate hanging over us, men could go about their pity|1
wavs/7_120.wav|concerns as they did. I remember how jubilant Markham was in securing a new photograph of the|1
wavs/7_121.wav|planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days. People in these latter times scarcely|1
wavs/7_122.wav|realized the abundance and enterprise of our 19th century papers. For my own part, I was much occupied|1
wavs/7_123.wav|in learning to ride the bicycle and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable developments|1
wavs/7_124.wav|of moral ideas as civilization progressed. One night, the first missile then could scarcely have|1
wavs/7_125.wav|been 10 million miles away, I went for a walk with my wife. It was starlight, and I explained the|1
wavs/7_126.wav|signs of the zodiac to her and pointed out Mars, a bright daughter-fly creeping zenith ward, towards|1
wavs/7_127.wav|which so many telescopes were pointed. It was a warm night. Coming home, a party of excursionists|1
wavs/7_128.wav|from Chertsey or Isleworth passed a singing and playing music. There were lights in the upper|1
wavs/7_129.wav|windows of the houses as the people went to bed. From the railway station in the distance came the|1
wavs/7_130.wav|sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling softened almost into melody by the distance.|1
wavs/7_131.wav|My wife pointed out to me the brightness of a red, green and yellow signal lights hanging in|1
wavs/7_132.wav|a framework against the sky. It seemed so safe and tranquil.|1
wavs/7_133.wav|End of chapter 1|1
wavs/8_0.wav|The sand of Hay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Perford.|1
wavs/8_1.wav|And the hedges on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses.|1
wavs/8_2.wav|The heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down Mayberry Hill seized as abruptly|1
wavs/8_3.wav|as it began, leaving the evening very peaceful and still. We got to Leatherhead without misadventure|1
wavs/8_4.wav|about nine o'clock, and the horse had an hour's rest while I took supper with my cousins and|1
wavs/8_5.wav|commended my wife to their care. My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive,|1
wavs/8_6.wav|and seemed oppressed with the forebodings of evil. I talked to her reassuringly, pointing out that|1
wavs/8_7.wav|the Martians were tied to the pit by sheer heaviness, and at the utmost could but crawl|1
wavs/8_8.wav|a little out of it. But she answered only in monosyllables. Had it not been for my promise|1
wavs/8_9.wav|to the innkeeper, she would, I think, have urged me to stay in Leatherhead that night.|1
wavs/8_10.wav|Wood that I had! Her face, I remember, was very white as we parted. For my own part I had been|1
wavs/8_11.wav|feverishly excited all day. Something very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a|1
wavs/8_12.wav|civilized community had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very sorry that I had to|1
wavs/8_13.wav|return to Mayberry that night. I was even afraid that that last fusillade I had heard might mean|1
wavs/8_14.wav|the extermination of our invaders from Mars. I can best express my state of mind by saying|1
wavs/8_15.wav|that I wanted to be in at the death. It was nearly eleven when I started to return. The|1
wavs/8_16.wav|night was unexpectedly dark. To me, walking out of the lighted passage of my cousin's house,|1
wavs/8_17.wav|it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as the day. Overhead the clouds were driving|1
wavs/8_18.wav|fast, albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us. My cousin's man lit both lamps. Happily,|1
wavs/8_19.wav|I knew the road intimately. My wife stood in the light of the doorway and watched me until I jumped|1
wavs/8_20.wav|up into the door-card. Then abruptly she turned and went in, leaving my cousin side by side,|1
wavs/8_21.wav|wishing me good-heb. I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife's fears,|1
wavs/8_22.wav|but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians. At that time I was absolutely in the|1
wavs/8_23.wav|dark as to the course of the evening's fighting. I did not know even the circumstances that had|1
wavs/8_24.wav|precipitated the conflict. As I came through Ockham, for that was the way I returned, and not|1
wavs/8_25.wav|through sand and old walking, I saw along the western horizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew|1
wavs/8_26.wav|nearer, crept slowly up the sky. The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled|1
wavs/8_27.wav|there with masses of black and red smoke. Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted|1
wavs/8_28.wav|window or so, the village showed not a sign of life. But I narrowly escaped an accident at the|1
wavs/8_29.wav|corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot of people stood with their backs to me. They said|1
wavs/8_30.wav|nothing to me as I passed. I do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill,|1
wavs/8_31.wav|nor do I know if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping securely, or deserted,|1
wavs/8_32.wav|or empty, or harassed, and watching against the terror of the night.|1
wavs/8_33.wav|From Ripley, until I came through Pyrford, I was in the valley of the way, and the red glare|1
wavs/8_34.wav|was hiding from me. As I ascended the little hill beyond Pyrford Church, the glare came into view|1
wavs/8_35.wav|again, and the trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was upon me.|1
wavs/8_36.wav|Then I heard midnight peeling out from Pyrford Church behind me, and then came the silhouette|1
wavs/8_37.wav|of Maybury Hill with its treetops and roofs black and sharp against the red. Even as I beheld this,|1
wavs/8_38.wav|a lurid green glare lit the road about me, and showed the distant woods towards Settlestone.|1
wavs/8_39.wav|I felt a tug at the reans. I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced, as it were,|1
wavs/8_40.wav|by a thread of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the field to my left.|1
wavs/8_41.wav|It was the third falling star. Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast,|1
wavs/8_42.wav|danced out the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst like a rocket|1
wavs/8_43.wav|overhead. The horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted. A moderate incline runs towards the|1
wavs/8_44.wav|foot of the Maybury Hill, and down this we clattered. Once the lightning had begun,|1
wavs/8_45.wav|it went on in as a rapid succession of flashes as I had ever seen. A thunder-claps, treading one|1
wavs/8_46.wav|of the heels of another, and with a strange crackling accompaniment, sounded more like|1
wavs/8_47.wav|the working of a gigantic electric machine than the usual detonating reverberations.|1
wavs/8_48.wav|The flickering light was blinding and confusing, and a thin hail smote ghastly at my face as I|1
wavs/8_49.wav|drove down the slope. At first I regarded little but the road before me, and then I|1
wavs/8_50.wav|my attention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the opposite slope of|1
wavs/8_51.wav|Maybury Hill. At first I took it for the wet roof of a house, but one flash following another|1
wavs/8_52.wav|shouted to be in swift, rolling movement. It was an elusive vision, a moment of bewildering|1
wavs/8_53.wav|darkness and then, in a flash of light daylight, the red masses of the orphanage, near the crest|1
wavs/8_54.wav|of the hill, the green tops of the pine trees, and this problematical object came out clear and sharp|1
wavs/8_56.wav|houses, striding over the young pine trees and smashing them aside in its career. A walking|1
wavs/8_57.wav|engine of glittering metal striding now across the heather, articulate ropes of steel dangling|1
wavs/8_58.wav|from it, and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder. A flash,|1
wavs/8_59.wav|and it came out vividly, heeling over one way with two feet in the air, to vanish and reappear|1
wavs/8_60.wav|almost instantly, as it seemed, with the next flash a hundred yards nearer. Can you imagine|1
wavs/8_61.wav|a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground? That was the impression those|1
wavs/8_62.wav|instant flashes gave. But, instead of a milking stool, imagine it a great body of machinery on|1
wavs/8_63.wav|a tripod stand. Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted, as brittle|1
wavs/8_64.wav|reeds are parted by men thrusting through them. They were snapped off and driven headlong. And a|1
wavs/8_65.wav|second huge tripod appeared, rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me, and I was gaping hard to meet|1
wavs/8_66.wav|it. At the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether. Not stopping to look again,|1
wavs/8_67.wav|I wrenched the horse's head hard round to the right, and in another moment the door-card had|1
wavs/8_68.wav|heeled over upon the horse. The shafts smashed noisily, and I was flung sideways and fell heavily|1
wavs/8_69.wav|into the shallow pool of water. I crawled out almost immediately and crouched, my feet still|1
wavs/8_70.wav|in the water, under a clump of furs. The horse lay motionless. His neck was broken. Poor brute.|1
wavs/8_71.wav|And by the lightning flashes I saw the black bulk of the overturned door-card in the silhouette of|1
wavs/8_72.wav|a wheel still spinning slowly. In another moment the collosal mechanism went striding by me and|1
wavs/8_73.wav|passed uphill towards Purford. Seen nearer, the thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere|1
wavs/8_74.wav|insensate machine driving on its way. Machine it was, with a ringing metallic pace and long,|1
wavs/8_75.wav|flexible, glittering tentacles, one of which gripped a young pine tree, swinging and rattling|1
wavs/8_76.wav|about its strange body. It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen herd that|1
wavs/8_77.wav|surmounted it moved to and fro, with the inevitable suggestion of a head looking about. Behind the|1
wavs/8_78.wav|main body was a huge mass of white matter like a gigantic fisherman's basket, and puffs of green|1
wavs/8_79.wav|smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs at the monster swept by me. And in an instant it was|1
wavs/8_80.wav|gone. So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning, in blinding highlights|1
wavs/8_81.wav|and dense black shadows. As it passed it set up an exultant,|1
wavs/8_82.wav|deafening howl that drowned the thunder. Allooo! Allooo! And in another minute it was with its|1
wavs/8_83.wav|companion half a mile away, stooping over something in the field. I have no doubt this thing in the|1
wavs/8_84.wav|field was the third of the ten cylinders they had fired at us from Mars.|1
wavs/8_85.wav|For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness, watching by the intermittent light|1
wavs/8_86.wav|these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the distance over the hatch-tops.|1
wavs/8_87.wav|A thin hail was now beginning, and as it came and went, the figures grew misty and then flashed into|1
wavs/8_88.wav|clearness again. Now and then came a gap in the lightning, and the night swallowed them up.|1
wavs/8_89.wav|I was soaked with hail above and puddle-water below. It was some time before my blank astonishment|1
wavs/8_90.wav|would let me struggle up the bank to a drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril.|1
wavs/8_91.wav|Not far from me was a little one-room squatter's hut of wood, surrounded by a patch of potato|1
wavs/8_92.wav|garden. I struggled to my feet at last, and crouching, and making use of every chance of|1
wavs/8_93.wav|cover, I made a run for this. I hammered at the door, but I could not make the people here,|1
wavs/8_94.wav|if there were any people inside, and after a time I desisted, and, veiling myself of a ditch for the|1
wavs/8_95.wav|greater part of the way, succeeded in crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, into the|1
wavs/8_96.wav|pine-woods towards Maybury. Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now, towards my own|1
wavs/8_97.wav|house. I walked among the trees, trying to find the footpath. It was very dark indeed in the wood,|1
wavs/8_98.wav|for the lightning was now becoming infrequent, and the hail which was purring down into torrent,|1
wavs/8_99.wav|fell in columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage. If I had fully realized the meaning|1
wavs/8_100.wav|of all the things I had seen, I should have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet|1
wavs/8_101.wav|to Street Copperman, so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead. But that night the strangeness|1
wavs/8_102.wav|of things about me, and my physical wretchedness, prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the|1
wavs/8_103.wav|skin, deafened, and blinded by the storm. I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that|1
wavs/8_104.wav|was as much motive as I had. I staggered through the trees, fell into a ditch, and bruised my knees|1
wavs/8_105.wav|against a plank, and finally splashed out into the lane that ran down from the college-arms.|1
wavs/8_106.wav|I say splashed, for the storm-water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent,|1
wavs/8_107.wav|there in the darkness. A man blundered into me, and sent me reeling back. He gave a cry of terror,|1
wavs/8_108.wav|sprang sideways, and rushed on, before I could gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him.|1
wavs/8_109.wav|So heavy was the stress of the storm, just at this place, that I had the hardest task to win my way|1
wavs/8_110.wav|up the hill. I went close up to the fence on the left, and worked my way along its palings.|1
wavs/8_111.wav|Near the top I stumbled upon something soft, and by a flash of lightning saw between my feet|1
wavs/8_112.wav|a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of boots. Before I could distinguish clearly how the man|1
wavs/8_113.wav|lay, the flicker of light had passed. I stood over him, waiting for the next flash. When it came,|1
wavs/8_114.wav|I saw that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not shabbily dressed. His head was bent under his body,|1
wavs/8_115.wav|and he lay crumpled, up close to the fence, as though he had been flung violently against it.|1
wavs/8_116.wav|Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before touched a dead body,|1
wavs/8_117.wav|I stooped and turned him over to feel for his heart. He was quite dead. Apparently his neck|1
wavs/8_118.wav|had been broken. The lightning flashed for a third time, and his face leaped upon me.|1
wavs/8_119.wav|I sprang to my feet. It was the landlord of the spotted dog, whose conveyance I had taken.|1
wavs/8_120.wav|I stepped over him gingerly and pushed up on the hill.|1
wavs/8_121.wav|I made my way by the police station and the cottage arms towards my own house.|1
wavs/8_122.wav|Nothing was burning on the hillside, though from the common there still came a red glare|1
wavs/8_123.wav|and a rolling tumour of ruddy smoke beating up against the drenching hail.|1
wavs/8_124.wav|So far as I could see by the flashes, the houses about me were mostly uninjured.|1
wavs/8_125.wav|By the cottage arms a dark heap lay in the road. Down the road towards Mabry Bridge there were|1
wavs/8_126.wav|voices and the sound of feet, but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them.|1
wavs/8_127.wav|I let myself in with my latch key, closed, locked and bolted the door, staggered to the foot of the|1
wavs/8_128.wav|staircase and sat down. My imagination was full of those striding metallic monsters|1
wavs/8_129.wav|and of the dead bodies smashed against the fence.|1
wavs/8_130.wav|I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall, shivering violently.|1

wavs/9_3.wav|The War of the Worlds, Chapter 12. What I saw of the destruction of Weybridge and Shepperton.|1
wavs/9_4.wav|As the dawn grew brighter, we withdrew from the window from which we had watched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs.|1
wavs/9_5.wav|The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in.|1
wavs/9_6.wav|He proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and then rejoin his Battery No. 12 of the Horse Artillery.|1
wavs/9_7.wav|My plan was to return at once to Leatherhead.|1
wavs/9_8.wav|And so greatly had the strength of the Martians impressed me that I had determined to take my way to Newhaven, and go with her out of the country forthwith.|1
wavs/9_9.wav|For I already perceived clearly that the country about London must inevitably be the scene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed.|1
wavs/9_10.wav|Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder with its guarding joints.|1
wavs/9_11.wav|Had I been alone, I think I should have taken my chance and struck across country.|1
wavs/9_12.wav|But the artilleryman dissuaded me.|1
wavs/9_13.wav|"'It is no kindness to the right sort of wife,' he said, to make her a widow."|1
wavs/9_14.wav|And in the end I agreed to go with him under cover of the woods, northward as far as Street Corbham, before I parted with him.|1
wavs/9_15.wav|Thence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead.|1
wavs/9_16.wav|I should have started at once, but my companion had been in active service and he knew better than that.|1
wavs/9_17.wav|He made me ransack the house for a flask which he filled with whisky, and we lined every available pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat.|1
wavs/9_18.wav|Then we crept out of the house and ran as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by which I had come overnight.|1
wavs/9_19.wav|The houses seemed deserted.|1
wavs/9_20.wav|In the road lay a group of three charred bodies close together, struck dead by the heat ray.|1
wavs/9_21.wav|And here and there were things that people had dropped.|1
wavs/9_22.wav|A clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the like poor valuables.|1
wavs/9_23.wav|At the corner turning up towards the post office, a little cart filled with boxes and furniture and horseless heeled over on a broken wheel.|1
wavs/9_24.wav|A cash box had been hastily smashed open and thrown under the debris.|1
wavs/9_25.wav|Except the lodge at the orphanage, which was still on fire, none of the houses had suffered very greatly here.|1
wavs/9_26.wav|The heat ray had shaved the chimney tops and passed.|1
wavs/9_27.wav|Yet, save ourselves, there did not seem to be a living soul on Mayberry Hill.|1
wavs/9_28.wav|The majority of the inhabitants had escaped, I suppose, by the way of the old walking road, the road I had taken when I drove to Leatherhead, or they had hidden.|1
wavs/9_29.wav|We went down the lane by the body of the man in black, sodden now from the overnight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill.|1
wavs/9_30.wav|We pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a soul.|1
wavs/9_31.wav|The woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of woods.|1
wavs/9_32.wav|For the most part, the trees had fallen, but a certain proportion still stood.|1
wavs/9_33.wav|Dismal gray stems with dark brown foliage instead of green.|1
wavs/9_34.wav|On our side, the fire had done no more than scorched the nearer trees.|1
wavs/9_35.wav|It had failed to secure its footing.|1
wavs/9_36.wav|In one place, the woodman had been at work on Saturday.|1
wavs/9_37.wav|Trees, felt and freshly trimmed, lay in the clearing with heaps of sawdust by the sawing machine and its engine.|1
wavs/9_38.wav|Hard by was a temporary hut, deserted.|1
wavs/9_39.wav|There was not a breath of wind this morning, and everything was strangely still.|1
wavs/9_40.wav|Even the birds were hushed, and as we hurried along, I and the artilleryman talked in whispers, and looked now and again over our shoulders.|1
wavs/9_41.wav|Once or twice we stopped to listen.|1
wavs/9_42.wav|After a time, we drew near the road, and as we did so, we heard the clatter of hooves, and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers riding slowly towards walking.|1
wavs/9_43.wav|We hated them, and they halted while we hurried towards them.|1
wavs/9_44.wav|It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of the Eighth through SARS, with a stand like a theater light, which the artilleryman told me was a heliograph.|1
wavs/9_45.wav|You are the first men I've seen coming this way this morning, said the lieutenant. What's brewing?|1
wavs/9_46.wav|His voice and face were eager. The men behind him stared curiously.|1
wavs/9_47.wav|The artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and saluted.|1
wavs/9_48.wav|Gun destroyed last night, sir? Have been hiding, trying to rejoin batteries, sir.|1
wavs/9_49.wav|You come inside of the Martians, I expect, about half a mile along this road.|1
wavs/9_50.wav|What the dickens are they like? asked the lieutenant.|1
wavs/9_51.wav|Joints and armors, sir. Hundred feet high. Three legs and a body like aluminum, with a mighty red hat and a hood, sir.|1
wavs/9_52.wav|Get out, said the lieutenant. What confounded nonsense.|1
wavs/9_53.wav|You see, sir, they carry a kind of box, sir, that shoots fire and strikes you dead.|1
wavs/9_54.wav|What do you mean, a gun?|1
wavs/9_55.wav|No, sir. And the artilleryman began a vivid account of the heat ray.|1
wavs/9_56.wav|Halfway through, the lieutenant interrupted him and looked at me.|1
wavs/9_57.wav|I was still standing on the bank by the side of the road.|1
wavs/9_58.wav|It's perfectly true, I said.|1
wavs/9_59.wav|Well, said the lieutenant, I suppose it's my business to see it, too.|1
wavs/9_60.wav|Look here, to the artilleryman.|1
wavs/9_61.wav|We're detailed here, clearing people out of their houses.|1
wavs/9_62.wav|You'd better go along and report yourself to Brigadier General Marvin and tell him all you know.|1
wavs/9_63.wav|He's at Weybridge. Know the way?|1
wavs/9_64.wav|I do, I said, and he turned his horse, Thysbitt, again.|1
wavs/9_65.wav|Half a mile, you say? said he.|1
wavs/9_66.wav|At most, I answered and pointed over the treetops, Thysbitt.|1
wavs/9_67.wav|He thanked me and rode on, and we saw them no more.|1
wavs/9_68.wav|Farther along, we came upon a group of three women and two children in the road,|1
wavs/9_69.wav|busy clearing out a laborious cottage.|1
wavs/9_70.wav|They had got hold of a little hand truck and were piling it up with unclean-looking bundles and shabby furniture.|1
wavs/9_71.wav|They were all too assiduously engaged to talk to us as we passed.|1
wavs/9_72.wav|By Byfleet station, we emerged from the pine trees and found the country calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight.|1
wavs/9_73.wav|We were far beyond the range of the heat ray there, and had it not been for the silent desertion of some of the houses,|1
wavs/9_74.wav|the stirring movement of packing and others, and the not-so-soldiers standing on the bridge of the railway|1
wavs/9_75.wav|and staring down the line towards Woking, the day would have seemed very like any other Sunday.|1
wavs/9_76.wav|Several farm wagons and carts were moving creakily along the road to Adelstone,|1
wavs/9_77.wav|and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw, across a stretch of flat meadow, six twelve-pounders,|1
wavs/9_78.wav|standing neatly at equal distances pointing towards Woking.|1
wavs/9_79.wav|The gunners stood by the guns waiting, and the ammunition wagons were at a businesslike distance.|1
wavs/9_80.wav|The men stood almost as if under inspection.|1
wavs/9_81.wav|That's good, said I. They will get one fair shot at any rate.|1
wavs/9_82.wav|The artillerymen hesitated at the gate.|1
wavs/9_83.wav|I shall go on, he said.|1
wavs/9_84.wav|Farther on, towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a number of men in white fatigued jackets|1
wavs/9_85.wav|throwing up a long rampart, and more guns behind.|1
wavs/9_86.wav|It's bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow, said the artillerymen.|1
wavs/9_87.wav|They haven't seen that fire beam yet.|1
wavs/9_88.wav|The officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the treetops, thus westward,|1
wavs/9_89.wav|and the men digging would stop every now and again to stare in the same direction.|1
wavs/9_90.wav|Byfleet was in a tumult, people packing, and a score of hussars, some of them dismounted,|1
wavs/9_91.wav|some of them on horseback, were hunting them about.|1
wavs/9_92.wav|Three or four black government wagons with crosses in white circles,|1
wavs/9_93.wav|and an old omnibus among other vehicles, were being loaded in the village street.|1
wavs/9_94.wav|There were scores of people, most of them sufficiently sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes.|1
wavs/9_95.wav|The soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their position.|1
wavs/9_96.wav|We saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score or more of flowerpots containing orchids,|1
wavs/9_97.wav|angrily postulating with the corporal, who would leave them behind.|1
wavs/9_98.wav|I stopped and gripped his arm.|1
wavs/9_99.wav|Do you know what's over there? I said, pointing at the pintops that hid the Martians.|1
wavs/9_100.wav|Eh? said he, turning.|1
wavs/9_101.wav|I was explaining these are valuable.|1
wavs/9_102.wav|Death! I shouted. Death is coming. Death!|1
wavs/9_103.wav|Leaving him to digest that if he could, I heard it on after the artillery men.|1
wavs/9_104.wav|At the corner I looked back.|1
wavs/9_105.wav|The soldier had left him and he was still standing by his box with the pots of orchids on the lid of it|1
wavs/9_106.wav|and staring vaguely over the trees.|1
wavs/9_107.wav|No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were established.|1
wavs/9_108.wav|The whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen in any town before.|1
wavs/9_109.wav|Carts, carriages, everywhere. The most astonishing miscellany of conveyances and horse-flush.|1
wavs/9_110.wav|The respectable inhabitants of the place, men in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily dressed,|1
wavs/9_111.wav|were packing riverside loafers energetically helping, children excited and for the most part highly delighted|1
wavs/9_112.wav|at this astonishing variation of their Sunday experiences.|1
wavs/9_113.wav|In the midst of it all, the worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration|1
wavs/9_114.wav|and his bell was jangling out above the excitement.|1
wavs/9_115.wav|I and the artillery men, seated on the step of the drinking fountain,|1
wavs/9_116.wav|made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us.|1
wavs/9_117.wav|Petrols of soldiers, here no longer hussars but grenadiers in white,|1
wavs/9_118.wav|were warning people to move now or take refuge in their cellars as soon as the firing began.|1
wavs/9_119.wav|We saw, as we crossed the railway bridge, that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station|1
wavs/9_120.wav|and the swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages.|1
wavs/9_121.wav|The ordinary traffic had been stopped, I believe, in order to allow the passage of troops and guns to Chertsey|1
wavs/9_122.wav|and I have heard since that a savage struggle occurred for places in the special train that were put on at a later hour.|1
wavs/9_123.wav|We remained at Weybridge until midday and at that hour we found ourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock|1
wavs/9_124.wav|where the Wey and Thames join.|1
wavs/9_125.wav|Part of the time we spent helping two old women pack a little cart.|1
wavs/9_126.wav|The Wey has a troubled mouth and at this point boats are to be hired and there was a ferry across the river.|1
wavs/9_127.wav|On the Shepperton side was an inn with a lawn and beyond that the Tower of Shepperton Church.|1
wavs/9_128.wav|It has been replaced by a spire, rose above the trees.|1
wavs/9_129.wav|Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives.|1
wavs/9_130.wav|As yet the flight had not grown to a panic, but there were already far more people than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross.|1
wavs/9_131.wav|People came panting along under heavy burdens.|1
wavs/9_132.wav|One husband and wife were even cutting a small outhouse door between them with some of their household goods piled thereon.|1
wavs/9_133.wav|One man told us he meant to try to get away from Shepperton Station.|1
wavs/9_134.wav|There was a lot of shouting and one man was even jesting.|1
wavs/9_135.wav|The idea people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply formidable human beings who might attack and sack the town to be subtly destroyed in the end.|1
wavs/9_136.wav|Every now and then people would glance nervously across the way at the meadows towards Chursey, but everything over there was still.|1
wavs/9_137.wav|Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything was quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side.|1
wavs/9_138.wav|The people who landed there from the boats went tramping off down the lane.|1
wavs/9_139.wav|The big ferry boat had just made a journey.|1
wavs/9_140.wav|Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives without offering to help.|1
wavs/9_141.wav|The inn was closed as it was now within prohibited hours.|1
wavs/9_142.wav|What's that? cried a boatman.|1
wavs/9_143.wav|Shut up, you fool, said a man near me to a yelping dog.|1
wavs/9_144.wav|Then the sound came again, this time from the direction of Chursey.|1
wavs/9_145.wav|A muffled thud, the sound of a gun.|1
wavs/9_146.wav|The fighting was beginning.|1
wavs/9_147.wav|Almost immediately unseen batteries across the river to our right.|1
wavs/9_148.wav|Unseen because of the trees took up the chorus, firing heavily one after the other.|1
wavs/9_149.wav|A woman screamed.|1
wavs/9_150.wav|Everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle near us, yet invisible to us.|1
wavs/9_151.wav|Nothing was to be seen, save flat meadows, cows feeding unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery-polar willows motionless in the warm sunlight.|1
wavs/9_152.wav|The soldiers stop him, said a woman beside me doubtfully.|1
wavs/9_153.wav|A haziness rose over the treetops.|1
wavs/9_154.wav|Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river.|1
wavs/9_155.wav|A puff of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung.|1
wavs/9_156.wav|And forthwith the ground heaved underfoot, and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing two or three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished.|1
wavs/9_157.wav|Here they are, shouted a man in a blue jersey.|1
wavs/9_158.wav|Yonder, do you see them?|1
wavs/9_159.wav|Yonder!|1
wavs/9_160.wav|Quickly, one after the other.|1
wavs/9_161.wav|One, two, three, four of the armoured Martians appeared.|1
wavs/9_162.wav|Far away over the little trees, across the flat meadow that stretched towards Churce, and striding hurriedly towards the river.|1
wavs/9_163.wav|Little cowed figures they seemed at first, going with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds.|1
wavs/9_164.wav|Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth.|1
wavs/9_165.wav|Their armoured bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly furbid upon the guns, growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer.|1
wavs/9_166.wav|One on the extreme left, the remotest that is, flourished a huge case high in the air, and the ghostly, terrible hydre I had already seen on Friday night, smote towards Churce and struck the town.|1
wavs/9_167.wav|At sight of these strange, swift and terrible creatures, the crowd near the watershed seemed to me to be for a moment horror struck.|1
wavs/9_168.wav|There was no screaming or shouting, but a silence.|1
wavs/9_169.wav|Then a hoarse murmur and a movement of feet, a splashing from water.|1
wavs/9_170.wav|A man, too frightened to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung round and sent me staring with a blow from the corner of his burden.|1
wavs/9_171.wav|A woman thrusted me with her hand and rushed past me.|1
wavs/9_172.wav|I turned with a rush of the people, but I was not too terrified for thought.|1
wavs/9_173.wav|The terrible hydre was in my mind.|1
wavs/9_174.wav|To get under water, that was it.|1
wavs/9_175.wav|Get under water, I shouted, unheeded.|1
wavs/9_176.wav|I faced about again and rushed towards the approaching Martian.|1
wavs/9_177.wav|Rushed right down the gravel beach and headlong into the water.|1
wavs/9_178.wav|Others did the same.|1
wavs/9_179.wav|A boatload of people putting back came leaping out as I rushed past.|1
wavs/9_180.wav|The stones under my feet were muddy and slippery, and the river was so low that I ran perhaps 20 feet, scarcely waist-deep.|1
wavs/9_181.wav|Then, I turned around and saw the water.|1
wavs/9_182.wav|Perhaps 20 feet, scarcely waist-deep.|1
wavs/9_183.wav|Then, as the Martians towered overhead, scarcely a couple of hundred yards away, I flung myself forward under the surface.|1
wavs/9_184.wav|The splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like thunderclaps in my ears.|1
wavs/9_185.wav|People were landing hastily on both sides of the river.|1
wavs/9_186.wav|But the Martian machine took no more notice for the moment of the people running this way and that than a man would of the confusion of ants in a nest against which his foot has kicked.|1
wavs/9_187.wav|When, half-suffocated, I raised my head above water, the Martians' hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river, and as it advanced, it swung loose what must have been the generator of the heat ray.|1
wavs/9_188.wav|In another moment, it was on the bank.|1
wavs/9_189.wav|And in a stride wading halfway across, the knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank, and in another moment it had raised itself to its full height again, close to the village of Shepperton.|1
wavs/9_190.wav|Fourthless, the six guns, which unknown to anyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind the outskirts of that village, fired simultaneously.|1
wavs/9_191.wav|The sudden near concussion, the last close upon the first, made my heart jump.|1
wavs/9_192.wav|The monster was already raising the case generating the heat ray as the first shell burst six yards above the hood.|1
wavs/9_193.wav|I gave a cry of astonishment.|1
wavs/9_194.wav|I saw and thought nothing of the other four Martian monsters.|1
wavs/9_195.wav|My attention was riveted upon the nearer incident.|1
wavs/9_196.wav|Simultaneously, two other shells burst in the air near the body as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to dodge, the fourth shell.|1
wavs/9_197.wav|The shell burst clean in the face of the thing.|1
wavs/9_198.wav|The hood bulged, flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and glittering metal.|1
wavs/9_199.wav|Hit, shouted I, with something between a scream and a cheer.|1
wavs/9_200.wav|I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me.|1
wavs/9_201.wav|I could have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation.|1
wavs/9_202.wav|The decapitated colossum reeled like a drunken giant, but it did not fall over.|1
wavs/9_203.wav|It recovered its balance by a miracle and no longer heeding its steps.|1
wavs/9_204.wav|And with the camera that fired the heat ray now rickety upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Sheperton.|1
wavs/9_205.wav|The living intelligence, the Martian within the hood was slain and splashed to the four winds of heaven.|1
wavs/9_206.wav|And the thing was now but a mere intricate device of metal whirling to destruction.|1
wavs/9_207.wav|It drove along in a straight line, incapable of guidance.|1
wavs/9_208.wav|It struck the tower of the Sheperton church, smashing it down like the impact of a battering ram might have done.|1
wavs/9_209.wav|Swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force into the river out of my sight.|1
wavs/9_210.wav|A violent explosion shook the air and a spout of water, steam, mud, and shattered metal shot far up into the sky.|1
wavs/9_211.wav|As the camera of the heat ray hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed into steam.|1
wavs/9_212.wav|In another moment, a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore, but almost scaldingly hot came sweeping round the bend upstream.|1
wavs/9_213.wav|I saw people struggling show bits and heard their screaming and shouting faintly about the seething and roar of the Martian scallops.|1
wavs/9_214.wav|For a moment, I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the need of self preservation.|1
wavs/9_215.wav|I splashed through the tumultuous water, pushing aside a man in black to do so, until I could see round the bend.|1
wavs/9_216.wav|Half a dozen deserter boats pitched aimlessly upon the confusion of the waves.|1
wavs/9_217.wav|The fallen Martian came into sight downstream, lying across the river, and for the most part submerged.|1
wavs/9_218.wav|Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and through the tumultuous whirling wisps I could see,|1
wavs/9_219.wav|intermittently and vaguely, the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and spray of mud and froth into the air.|1
wavs/9_220.wav|The tentacles swayed and struck like living arms, and, save for the helpless purposelessness of these movements,|1
wavs/9_221.wav|it was as if some wounded thing was struggling for its life amid the waves.|1
wavs/9_222.wav|Enormous quantities of ruddy brown fluid were spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine.|1
wavs/9_223.wav|My attention was diverted from this death flurry, but a furious yelling, like that of a thing caught as siren in our manufacturing towns.|1
wavs/9_224.wav|A man, knee-deep near the towering path, shouted inaudibly to me and pointed.|1
wavs/9_225.wav|Looking back, I saw the other Martians advancing with gigantic strides down the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey.|1
wavs/9_226.wav|The shepherd and gun spoke this time unavailingly.|1
wavs/9_227.wav|At that, I ducked at once under water, and holding my breath until movement was in agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as long as I could.|1
wavs/9_228.wav|The water was in a tumult about me and rapidly growing hotter.|1
wavs/9_229.wav|When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the air and water from my eyes,|1
wavs/9_230.wav|the steam was rising in a whirling white fog that had first hit the Martians altogether.|1
wavs/9_231.wav|The noise was deafening. Then I saw them, dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnified by the mist.|1
wavs/9_232.wav|They had passed by me and two were stooping over the frothing, tumultuous ruins of their comrade.|1
wavs/9_233.wav|The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two hundred yards from me, the other towards Lailham.|1
wavs/9_234.wav|The generators of the heat ray raved high and the hissing beams smote down this way and that.|1
wavs/9_235.wav|The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of noises, the clangorous din of the Martians,|1
wavs/9_236.wav|the crash of falling houses, the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the crackling and roaring of fire.|1
wavs/9_237.wav|Dense black smoke was creeping up to mingle with the steam from the river,|1
wavs/9_238.wav|and as the heat ray went to and fro over Weybridge, its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white|1
wavs/9_239.wav|that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames.|1
wavs/9_240.wav|The nearer houses still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint, and pallid in the steam, with a fire behind them going to and fro.|1
wavs/9_241.wav|For a moment perhaps I stood there, breast high in the almost boiling water, dumbfounded at my position, hopeless of escape.|1
wavs/9_242.wav|Through the reek I could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out of the water through the reeds,|1
wavs/9_243.wav|like little frogs hurrying through the grass from the advance of a man, or running to and fro in utter dismay on the towing path.|1
wavs/9_244.wav|Then suddenly the white flashes of the heat ray came leaping towards me.|1
wavs/9_245.wav|The houses caved in as they dissolved as its touch and darted off flames.|1
wavs/9_246.wav|The trees changed to fire with a roar. The ray flickered up and down the towing path, licking off the people who ran this way and that,|1
wavs/9_247.wav|and came down to the water's edge not fifty yards from where I stood.|1
wavs/9_248.wav|It swept across the river to Shepperton, and the water in its track rose in a boiling wheel crested with steam. I turned shoreward.|1
wavs/9_249.wav|In another moment a huge wave, well nigh the boiling point, had rushed upon me. I screamed aloud and scalded, half-blind, agonized.|1
wavs/9_250.wav|I staggered through the leaping, hissing water towards the shore. Had my foot stumbled, it would have been the end.|1
wavs/9_251.wav|I fell helplessly in full sight of the Martians upon the broad, bare, gravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle of the way in Thames.|1
wavs/9_252.wav|I expected nothing but death.|1
wavs/9_253.wav|I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within a score of yards of my head, driving straight into the loose gravel, whirling it this way and that, and lifting again.|1
wavs/9_254.wav|Of a long suspense, and then of the four, carrying the debris of their comrade between them, now clear and then presently faint through a veil of smoke, receding interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space of river and meadow.|1
wavs/9_255.wav|And then, very slowly, I realized that by a miracle I had escaped.|1

wavs/10_2.wav|The War of the Worlds Chapter 14 in London|1
wavs/10_3.wav|My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking. He was a medical|1
wavs/10_4.wav|student working for an imminent examination and he heard nothing of the arrival until|1
wavs/10_5.wav|Saturday morning. The morning papers in Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy special|1
wavs/10_6.wav|articles on the planet Mars, on life on the planets and so forth, a brief and vaguely|1
wavs/10_7.wav|worded telegram, all the more striking for its brevity.|1
wavs/10_8.wav|The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a number of people with|1
wavs/10_9.wav|a quick-firing gun, so the story ran. The telegram concluded with the words,|1
wavs/10_10.wav|Formidable as they seem to be, the Martians have not moved from the pit into which they|1
wavs/10_11.wav|have fallen, and indeed seem incapable of doing so. Probably this is due to the relative|1
wavs/10_12.wav|strength of the Earth's gravitational energy. On that last text their leader-writer expanded|1
wavs/10_13.wav|very comfortingly.|1
wavs/10_14.wav|Of course, all the students in the Kramers biology class, to which my brother went that|1
wavs/10_15.wav|day, were intensely interested, but there were no signs of any unusual excitement in|1
wavs/10_16.wav|the streets. The afternoon papers puffed scraps of news under big headlines. They had nothing|1
wavs/10_17.wav|to tell beyond the movements of troops about the common and the burning of the pine woods|1
wavs/10_18.wav|between Woking and Weybridge until eight. Then the St. James Gazette, in an extra special|1
wavs/10_19.wav|edition, announced the bare fact of the interruption of telegraphic communication. This was thought|1
wavs/10_20.wav|to be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the line. Nothing more of the|1
wavs/10_21.wav|fighting was known that night, the night of my drive to Leatherhead and back.|1
wavs/10_22.wav|My brother felt no anxiety about us, as he knew from the description in the papers that|1
wavs/10_23.wav|the cylinder was a good two miles from my house. He made up his mind to run down that|1
wavs/10_24.wav|night to me in order, as he says, to see the things before they were killed. He dispatched|1
wavs/10_25.wav|a telegram, which never reached me, about four o'clock, and spent the evening at the|1
wavs/10_26.wav|music hall. In Lawton, also, on Saturday night, there was a thunderstorm, and my brother reached|1
wavs/10_27.wav|Waterloo in a cab. On the platform from which the midnight train usually starts, he learned,|1
wavs/10_28.wav|after some waiting, that an accident prevented trains from reaching Woking that night. The|1
wavs/10_29.wav|nature of the accident he could not ascertain. Indeed, the railway authorities did not clearly|1
wavs/10_30.wav|know at that time. There was very little excitement in the station, as the officials, failing|1
wavs/10_31.wav|to realize that anything further than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking Junction had occurred,|1
wavs/10_32.wav|were running the theatre trains which usually passed through Woking round by Virginia Water|1
wavs/10_33.wav|or Guildford. They were busy making the necessary arrangements to alter the route of the Thyshampton|1
wavs/10_34.wav|and Perth-Mis-Sunday League excursions.|1
wavs/10_35.wav|A nocturnal newspaper reporter, mistaking my brother for the traffic manager to whom|1
wavs/10_36.wav|he bears a slight resemblance, waylaid and tried to interview him. Few people, excepting|1
wavs/10_37.wav|the railway officials, connected the breakdown with the Martians. I have read in another|1
wavs/10_38.wav|account of these events that on Sunday morning all London was electrified by the news from|1
wavs/10_39.wav|Woking. As a matter of fact, there was nothing to justify that very extravagant phrase. Plenty|1
wavs/10_40.wav|of Londoners did not hear of the Martians until the panic of Monday morning. Those who|1
wavs/10_41.wav|did took some time to realize all the hastily worded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed.|1
wavs/10_42.wav|The majority of people in London do not read Sunday papers.|1
wavs/10_43.wav|The habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed in the Londoners' mind|1
wavs/10_44.wav|and startling intelligence so much a matter of course in the papers that they could read|1
wavs/10_45.wav|without any personal tremors. About seven o'clock last night the Martians came out|1
wavs/10_46.wav|of the cylinder and, moving about under an armour of metallic shields, have completely|1
wavs/10_47.wav|wrecked Woking station with the adjacent houses and massacred an entire battalion of the Cardigan|1
wavs/10_48.wav|regiment. No details are known, maxims have been absolutely useless against their armour,|1
wavs/10_49.wav|the field guns have been disabled by them, flying hussars have been galloping into Jersey,|1
wavs/10_50.wav|the Martians appear to be moving slowly towards Jersey, on Windsor. Great anxiety prevails|1
wavs/10_51.wav|in West Surrey, and earthworks are being thrown up to check the advance Londonward.|1
wavs/10_52.wav|That was how the Sunday Sun put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt handbook article|1
wavs/10_53.wav|in the Referee compared the affair to a menagerie suddenly let loose in a village.|1
wavs/10_54.wav|No one in London knew positively of the nature of the armoured Martians, and there was still|1
wavs/10_55.wav|a fixed idea that these monsters must be sluggish. Crawling, creeping, painfully, such expressions|1
wavs/10_56.wav|occurred in almost all the earlier reports. None of the telegrams could have been written|1
wavs/10_57.wav|by an eyewitness of their advance. The Sunday papers printed separate editions as further|1
wavs/10_58.wav|news came to hand, some even in default of it. But there was practically nothing more|1
wavs/10_59.wav|to tell people until late in the afternoon, when the authorities gave the press agencies|1
wavs/10_60.wav|the news in their possession. It was stated that the people of Walton and Weybridge and|1
wavs/10_61.wav|all the district were porting along the roads Londonward, and that was all.|1
wavs/10_62.wav|My brother went to church at the Foundling Hospital in the morning, still in ignorance|1
wavs/10_63.wav|of what had happened on the previous night. There he heard allusions made to the invasion|1
wavs/10_64.wav|and a special prayer for peace. Coming out, he bought a referee. He became alarmed at|1
wavs/10_65.wav|the news in this, and went again to Waterloo station to find out if communication were|1
wavs/10_66.wav|restored. The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, and innumerable people walking in their best|1
wavs/10_67.wav|clothes seemed scarcely affected by the strange intelligence that the news vendors were disseminating.|1
wavs/10_68.wav|People were interested, or if alarmed, alarmed only on account of the local residents. At|1
wavs/10_69.wav|the station he heard for the first time that the Windsor and Chertsey lines were now interrupted.|1
wavs/10_70.wav|The porters told him that several remarkable telegrams had been received in the morning|1
wavs/10_71.wav|from Byfleet and Chertsey stations, but that these had abruptly ceased. My brother could|1
wavs/10_72.wav|get very little precise detail out of them.|1
wavs/10_73.wav|There is fighting going on about Weybridge, was the extent of their information. The train|1
wavs/10_74.wav|service was now very much disorganized. Quite a number of people who had been expecting|1
wavs/10_75.wav|friends from places on the Thou's Western network were standing about the station. One|1
wavs/10_76.wav|grey-headed old gentleman came and abused the Thou's Western company bitterly to my|1
wavs/10_77.wav|brother.|1
wavs/10_78.wav|It was showing up, he said.|1
wavs/10_79.wav|One or two trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston containing people who had gone|1
wavs/10_80.wav|out for a day's boating, and found the locks closed and a feeling of panic in the air.|1
wavs/10_81.wav|A man in a blue and white blazer addressed my brother full of strange tidings.|1
wavs/10_82.wav|There's hosts of people driving into Kingston, and traps and carts and things, with boxes|1
wavs/10_83.wav|and valuables and all that, he said. They come from Moles, Weybridge and Walton, and|1
wavs/10_84.wav|they say there's been guns heard at Chertsey, heavy fighting, and that mounted soldiers|1
wavs/10_85.wav|have told them to get off at once because the Martians are coming. We heard guns firing|1
wavs/10_86.wav|at Hampton Court Station, but we thought it was thunder. What the dickens does it all|1
wavs/10_87.wav|mean? The Martians can't get out of their pit, can they?|1
wavs/10_88.wav|My brother could not tell him. Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had|1
wavs/10_89.wav|spread to the clients of the Underground Railway, and that the Sunday excursionists began to|1
wavs/10_90.wav|return from all over the Thirskwestern Lung, Barnes, Wimbledon, Richmond, Park, Kew, and|1
wavs/10_91.wav|so forth, at unnaturally early hours, but not a soul had anything more than vague hearsay|1
wavs/10_92.wav|to tell of. Everyone connected with the terminus seemed ill-tempered.|1
wavs/10_93.wav|About five o'clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely excited by the opening|1
wavs/10_94.wav|of the line of communication, which is almost invariably closed between the Thous-Eastern|1
wavs/10_95.wav|and the Thous-Western stations, and the passage of carriages, trucks bearing huge guns and|1
wavs/10_96.wav|carriages crammed with soldiers. These were the guns that were brought up from Woolwich|1
wavs/10_97.wav|and Chatham to cover Kingston. There was an exchange of pleasantries, you'll get eaten,|1
wavs/10_98.wav|or we're the beast tamers, and so forth. A little while after that a squad of police|1
wavs/10_99.wav|came into the station and began to clear the public off the platforms, and my brother went|1
wavs/10_100.wav|out into the streets again. The church bells were ringing for even-song,|1
wavs/10_101.wav|and a squad of Salvation Army lassies came singing down Waterloo Road. On the bridge|1
wavs/10_102.wav|a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came drifting down the stream|1
wavs/10_103.wav|in patches. The sun was just setting, and the clock tower and the houses of Parliament|1
wavs/10_104.wav|rose against one of the most peaceful skies it is possible to imagine, a sky of gold,|1
wavs/10_105.wav|bare it was long transverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud. There was talk of a floating body.|1
wavs/10_106.wav|One of the men there, a reservist, he said he was, told my brother he had seen the heliograph|1
wavs/10_107.wav|flickering in the west. In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy ruffs who|1
wavs/10_108.wav|had just been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and staring placards.|1
wavs/10_109.wav|Dreadful catastrophe! they bawled, one to the other, down Wellington Street. Fighting|1
wavs/10_110.wav|at Weybridge! Full description! Repulse of the Martians! London in danger! He had to|1
wavs/10_111.wav|give three pence for a copy of that paper. Then it was, and then only, that he realized|1
wavs/10_112.wav|something of the full power and terror of these monsters. He learned that they were|1
wavs/10_113.wav|not merely a handful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were mines swaying vast mechanical|1
wavs/10_114.wav|bodies, and that they could move swiftly and smite with such power that even the mightiest|1
wavs/10_115.wav|guns could not stand against them. They were described as vast spider-like machines, nearly|1
wavs/10_116.wav|a hundred feet high, capable of the speed of an express train, and able to shoot out|1
wavs/10_117.wav|a beam of intense heat. Masked batteries, chiefly of field guns, had been planted in|1
wavs/10_118.wav|the country about Horseth Common, and especially between the walking district and London. Five|1
wavs/10_119.wav|of the machines had been seen moving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance, had|1
wavs/10_120.wav|been destroyed, and in the other cases the shells had missed, and the batteries had been|1
wavs/10_121.wav|at once nearly hated by the heat-rays. Heavy losses of soldiers were mentioned, but the|1
wavs/10_122.wav|tone of the dispatch was optimistic. The Martians had been repulsed, they were not|1
wavs/10_123.wav|invulnerable. They had retreated to their triangle of cylinders again, in the circle|1
wavs/10_124.wav|about walking. Signallers with heliographs were pushing forbid upon them from all sides.|1
wavs/10_125.wav|Guns were in rapid transit from Windsor, Portsmouth, or the short Woolwich, even from the north.|1
wavs/10_126.wav|Among others, long wire guns of ninety-five tons from Woolwich. All together, one hundred|1
wavs/10_127.wav|and sixteen were in position, or being hastily placed, chiefly covering London. Never before|1
wavs/10_128.wav|in England had there been such a vast or rapid concentration of military material. Any further|1
wavs/10_129.wav|cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could be destroyed at once by high explosives, which|1
wavs/10_130.wav|were being rapidly manufactured and distributed. No doubt, ran the report, the situation was|1
wavs/10_131.wav|of the strangest and gravest description, but the public was exhorted to avoid and discourage|1
wavs/10_132.wav|panic. No doubt the Martians were strange and terrible in the extreme, but at the outside|1
wavs/10_133.wav|there could not be more than twenty of them against our millions. The authorities had|1
wavs/10_134.wav|reason to suppose, from the size of the cylinders, that at the outside there could not be more|1
wavs/10_135.wav|than five in each cylinder, fifteen altogether. And one at least was disposed of, perhaps|1
wavs/10_136.wav|before. The public would be fairly warned of the approach of danger, and elaborate measures|1
wavs/10_137.wav|were being taken for the protection of the people in the threatened southwestern suburbs.|1
wavs/10_138.wav|And so, with reiterated assurances of the safety of London and the ability of the authorities|1
wavs/10_139.wav|to cope with the difficulty, this quasi-proclamation closed. This was printed in enormous type|1
wavs/10_140.wav|on paper, so fresh that it was still wet, and there had been no time to add a word of|1
wavs/10_141.wav|comment. It was curious, my brother said, to see how ruthlessly the usual contents|1
wavs/10_142.wav|of the paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place. All down Wellington Street|1
wavs/10_143.wav|people could be seen fluttering out the pink sheets and reading, and the Strand was suddenly|1
wavs/10_144.wav|noisy with the voices of an army of hawkies following these pioneers. Men came scrambling|1
wavs/10_145.wav|off buses to secure copies. Certainly this news excited people intensely, whatever their|1
wavs/10_146.wav|previous apathy. The shutters of the map-shop in the Strand were being taken down, my brother|1
wavs/10_147.wav|said, and a man in his Sunday raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, was visible inside the window|1
wavs/10_148.wav|hastily fastening mups of Surrey to the glass. Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square,|1
wavs/10_149.wav|the paper in his hand, my brother saw some of the fugitives from West Surrey. There was|1
wavs/10_150.wav|a man with his wife and two boys, and some articles of furniture in a cart, such as greengrocers|1
wavs/10_151.wav|use. He was driving from the direction of Westminster Bridge, and close behind him came|1
wavs/10_152.wav|a hay wagon with five or six respectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and bundles.|1
wavs/10_153.wav|The faces of these peoples were haggard, and their entire appearance contrasted conspicuously|1
wavs/10_154.wav|with the Thabath-best appearance of the people in the omnibuses. People in fashionable clothing peeped|1
wavs/10_155.wav|at them out of caps. They stopped at the square as if undecided which way to take, and finally|1
wavs/10_156.wav|turned eastward along the Strand. Some way behind the east came a man in workday clothes,|1
wavs/10_157.wav|riding one of those old-fashioned tricycles with a small front wheel. He was dirty and|1
wavs/10_158.wav|white in the face. My brother turned down towards Victoria and met a number of such|1
wavs/10_159.wav|people. He had a vague idea that he might see something of me. He noticed an unusual|1
wavs/10_160.wav|number of police regulating the traffic. Some of the refugees were exchanging news with|1
wavs/10_161.wav|the people on the omnibuses. One was professing to have seen the Martians. Boilers and stills,|1
wavs/10_162.wav|I tell you, striding along like men. Most of them were excited and animated by their|1
wavs/10_163.wav|strange experience. Beyond Victoria, the public houses were doing lively trade with|1
wavs/10_164.wav|these arrivals. At all the street corners, groups of people were reading papers, talking|1
wavs/10_165.wav|silently or staring at these unusual Sunday visitors. Days seemed to increase as night|1
wavs/10_166.wav|drew on, until at last the roads, my brother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby|1
wavs/10_167.wav|day. My brother addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers from|1
wavs/10_168.wav|most. None of them could tell him any news of walking, except one man who assured him|1
wavs/10_169.wav|that walking had been entirely destroyed on the previous night.|1
wavs/10_170.wav|"'I come from Byfleet,' he said. Men on a bicycle came through the place in the early|1
wavs/10_171.wav|morning and ran from door to door, warning us to come away. Then came soldiers. We went|1
wavs/10_172.wav|out to look, and there were clouds of smoke to the thouse, nothing but smoke, and not|1
wavs/10_173.wav|a soul coming that way. Then we heard the guns at Chertsey and folks coming from Weybridge.|1
wavs/10_174.wav|So I flogged up my house and come on." At the time there was a strong feeling in the|1
wavs/10_175.wav|streets that the authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the invaders|1
wavs/10_176.wav|without all this inconvenience. About eight o'clock the noise of heavy firing was distinctly|1
wavs/10_177.wav|audible all over the Thouse of London. My brother could not hear it for the traffic|1
wavs/10_178.wav|in the main thoroughfare, but by striking through the quiet backstreets to the river|1
wavs/10_179.wav|he was able to distinguish it quite plainly. He walked from Westminster to his apartments|1
wavs/10_180.wav|near Regents Park about two. He was now very anxious, on my account, and disturbed at the|1
wavs/10_181.wav|evident magnitude of the trouble. His mind was inclined to run, even as mine had ran|1
wavs/10_182.wav|on Saturday, on military details. He thought of all those silent, expectant guns of the|1
wavs/10_183.wav|suddenly nomadic countryside. He tried to imagine boilers and stills a hundred feet high.|1
wavs/10_184.wav|There were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along Oxford Street and several in the|1
wavs/10_185.wav|Marylebone Road, but so slowly was the news spreading that Regent Street and Portland Place|1
wavs/10_186.wav|were full of their usual Sunday night promenaders, albeit they talked in groups, and along the|1
wavs/10_187.wav|etched Regents Park there was many silent couples walking out together under the scattered gas|1
wavs/10_188.wav|lamps as ever there had been. The night was warm and still, and a little oppressive. The sound of|1
wavs/10_189.wav|guns continued intermittently, and after midnight there seemed to be sheet lightning in the south.|1
wavs/10_190.wav|He read and re-read the paper, fearing the worst had happened to me. He was restless, and after|1
wavs/10_191.wav|supper prowled out again aimlessly. He returned and tried in vain to divert his attention to his|1
wavs/10_192.wav|examination notes. He went to bed a little after midnight and was awakened from lurid dreams in the|1
wavs/10_193.wav|small house of Monday where the sound of door knockers, feet running in the street,|1
wavs/10_194.wav|distant drumming, and a clamor of bells. Red reflections danced on the ceiling. For a moment|1
wavs/10_195.wav|he lay astonished, wondering whether day had come or the world had gone mad. Then he jumped out of|1
wavs/10_196.wav|the bed and ran to the window. His room was an attic, and as he thrust his head out, up and down|1
wavs/10_197.wav|the street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash, and heads in every kind of|1
wavs/10_198.wav|night's disarray appeared. Enquiries were being shouted. They are coming, bawled the policeman,|1
wavs/10_199.wav|hammering at the door. The Martians are coming, and hurried to the next door. The sound of drumming|1
wavs/10_200.wav|and trumpeting came from the Albany street barracks, and every church with an earshot was|1
wavs/10_201.wav|hard at work, killing sleep with a vehement disorderly toxin. There was a noise of doors|1
wavs/10_202.wav|opening at window after window, and the house's opposite flashed from darkness into yellow|1
wavs/10_203.wav|illumination. Up the street came galloping a closed carriage, bursting abruptly into noise at the|1
wavs/10_204.wav|corner, rising to a clattering climax under the window, and dying away slowly in the distance.|1
wavs/10_205.wav|Close on the rear of this came a couple of cabs, the forerunners of a long procession of flying|1
wavs/10_206.wav|vehicles, going for the most part to Chalk Farm Station, where the Northwestern special trains|1
wavs/10_207.wav|were loading up instead of coming down the gradient into Houston. For a long time my brother|1
wavs/10_208.wav|stared out of the window in blank astonishment, watching the policeman hammering at door after|1
wavs/10_209.wav|door, and delivering their incomprehensible message. Then the door behind him opened,|1
wavs/10_210.wav|and the man who lodged across the landing came in, dressed only in a shirt, trousers, and slippers,|1
wavs/10_211.wav|his braces loose about his waist, his hair disordered from his pillow.|1
wavs/10_212.wav|"'What the devil is it?' he asked. "'A fire? What a devil of a row!' They both craned their heads|1
wavs/10_213.wav|out of the window, straining to hear what the policemen were shouting. The people were coming|1
wavs/10_214.wav|out of the side streets and standing in groups at the corners, talking. "'What the devil is it all|1
wavs/10_215.wav|about?' said my brother's fellow lodger. My brother answered him vaguely, and began to dress, running|1
wavs/10_216.wav|with each garment to the window, in order to miss nothing of the growing excitement. Presently men|1
wavs/10_217.wav|selling unnaturally early newspapers came bawling into the street. "'London in danger of suffocation!|1
wavs/10_218.wav|The Kingston and Richmond defences forced! Fearful massacres in the Thames Valley!'|1
wavs/10_219.wav|"'And all about him, in the rooms below, in the houses on each side and across the road,|1
wavs/10_220.wav|and behind in the park terraces, and in the hundred other streets of that part of the Mary|1
wavs/10_221.wav|Libone, and the Westbourne Park district in St. Pancras, and westward and northward in Kilburn|1
wavs/10_222.wav|and St. John's Wood and Hampstead, and eastward in Shoreditch and Highbury and Haggerston and|1
wavs/10_223.wav|Hoxton, and indeed through all the vastness of London from Ealing to Eastham, people were rubbing|1
wavs/10_224.wav|their eyes and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless questions, dressing hastily as the|1
wavs/10_225.wav|first breath of the coming storm of fear blew through the streets. It was the dawn of the great|1
wavs/10_226.wav|panic. London, which had gone to bed on Sunday night oblivious and inert, was awakened in the|1
wavs/10_227.wav|small hours of Monday morning to a vivid sense of danger. Unable from his window to learn what was|1
wavs/10_228.wav|happening, my brother went down and out into the streets, just as the sky between the parapets of|1
wavs/10_229.wav|the houses grew pink with the early dawn. The flying people on foot and in vehicles grew more|1
wavs/10_230.wav|numerous every moment. Black smoke! he heard, people crying, and again, black smoke! The|1
wavs/10_231.wav|contagious of such a unanimous fear was inevitable. As my brother hesitated on the doorstep, he saw|1
wavs/10_232.wav|another news vendor approaching and got a paper forthwith. The man was running away with a rest|1
wavs/10_233.wav|and selling his papers for a shilling each as he ran a grotesque mingling of profit and panic.|1
wavs/10_234.wav|And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of the commander-in-chief.|1
wavs/10_235.wav|The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and poisonous vapor by means of rockets.|1
wavs/10_236.wav|They have thmosed our batteries, destroyed Richmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, and are advancing|1
wavs/10_237.wav|slowly towards London, destroying everything on the way. It is impossible to stop them. There is|1
wavs/10_238.wav|no safety from the black smoke but an instant flight. That was all, but it was enough. The whole|1
wavs/10_239.wav|population of the great six million city was stirring, slipping, running. Presently it would be|1
wavs/10_240.wav|pouring en masse northward. Black smoke! the voices cried. Fire! The bells of the neighboring church|1
wavs/10_241.wav|made a jangling tumult. A coward, carelessly driven, smashed amid shrieks and curses against|1
wavs/10_242.wav|the water throughout the streets. Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the houses and some of|1
wavs/10_243.wav|the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps. And overhead the dawn was growing brighter, clear and|1
wavs/10_244.wav|steady and calm. He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms and up and down the stairs|1
wavs/10_245.wav|behind him. His landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped in a dressing-gown and shawl,|1
wavs/10_246.wav|her husband following ejaculating. As my brother began to realize the import of all these things,|1
wavs/10_247.wav|he turned hastily to his own room, put all his available money, some ten pounds altogether,|1
wavs/10_248.wav|into his pockets and went out again into the streets.|1

wavs/11_3.wav|The War of the Worlds. Book 2, Chapter 3. The Days of Imprisonment.|1
wavs/11_4.wav|The arrival of a second fighting machine drove us from our peephole into the scullery,|1
wavs/11_5.wav|for we feared that from his elevation the Martian might see down upon us behind our barrier.|1
wavs/11_6.wav|At a later date we began to feel less in danger of their eyes,|1
wavs/11_7.wav|for to an eye in the dazzle of the sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness,|1
wavs/11_8.wav|but at the first slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery in heart-throbbing|1
wavs/11_9.wav|retreat. Yet terrible as was the danger we incurred, the attraction of peeping was for both|1
wavs/11_10.wav|of us irresistible. And I recall now with a sort of wonder that in spite of the infinite danger in|1
wavs/11_11.wav|which we were, between starvation and a still more terrible death, we could yet struggle bitterly for|1
wavs/11_12.wav|that horrible privilege of sight. We would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between|1
wavs/11_13.wav|eagerness and the dread of making a noise, and strike each other and thrust and kick within a|1
wavs/11_14.wav|few inches of exposure. The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and habits|1
wavs/11_15.wav|of thoughts in action, and our danger and isolation only accentuated the incompatibility.|1
wavs/11_16.wav|At Haliford I had already come to hate the curate's trick of helpless exclamation,|1
wavs/11_17.wav|his stupid rigidity of mind, his endless muttering monologue, vitiated every effort I made|1
wavs/11_18.wav|to think out a line of action, and drove me at times, though spent up and intensified, almost to|1
wavs/11_19.wav|the verge of craziness. He was as lacking in restraint as a silly woman he would weep for|1
wavs/11_20.wav|hours together, and I verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought his|1
wavs/11_21.wav|weak tears in some way efficacious, and I would sit in the darkness, unable to keep my mind off him|1
wavs/11_22.wav|by reason of his importunities. He ate more than I did, and it was in vain I pointed out that our|1
wavs/11_23.wav|only chance of life was to stop in the house until the Martians had done with their pit,|1
wavs/11_24.wav|that in that long patience a time might presently come when we should need food.|1
wavs/11_25.wav|He ate and drank impulsively, and heavy meals at long intervals he slept little.|1
wavs/11_26.wav|As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any consideration so intensified our distress|1
wavs/11_27.wav|and danger that I had, much as a loathe doing it, to resort to threats, and at last to blows.|1
wavs/11_28.wav|That brought him to reason for a time, but he was one of those weak creatures, void of pride,|1
wavs/11_29.wav|timorous, anemic, hateful thou's, full of shifty cunning, who face neither God nor man, who face|1
wavs/11_30.wav|not even themselves. It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things, but I set them down|1
wavs/11_31.wav|that my story may lack nothing. Those who have escaped the dark and terrible aspects of life|1
wavs/11_32.wav|will find my brutality, my flash of rage in our final tragedy, easy enough to blame,|1
wavs/11_33.wav|for they know that what is wrong as well as any, but not what is possible to torture men,|1
wavs/11_34.wav|but those who have been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to elemental things,|1
wavs/11_35.wav|will have a wider charity. And while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of whispers,|1
wavs/11_36.wav|snatched food and drink, and gripping hands and blows, without in the pitiless sunlight of the|1
wavs/11_37.wav|terrible June was the strange wonder, the unfamiliar routine of the Martians in the pit.|1
wavs/11_38.wav|Let me return to those first new experiences of mine. After a long time I ventured back to|1
wavs/11_39.wav|the peephole, to find that the newcomers had been reinforced by the occupants of no fewer than three|1
wavs/11_40.wav|of the fighting machines. These last had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in|1
wavs/11_41.wav|an orderly manner about the cylinder. The second handling machine was now completed, and was busy|1
wavs/11_42.wav|in serving one of the novel contrivances the big machine had brought. This was a body resembling|1
wavs/11_43.wav|a milk can in its general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and from|1
wavs/11_44.wav|which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin below. The oscillatory motion was|1
wavs/11_45.wav|imparted to this by one tentacle of the handling machine. With two spatulate hands, the handling|1
wavs/11_46.wav|machine was digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped receptacle above,|1
wavs/11_47.wav|while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed rusty and blackened clinkers|1
wavs/11_48.wav|from the middle part of the machine. Another steely tentacle directed the powder from the|1
wavs/11_49.wav|basin along a ripped canal towards some receiver that was hidden from me by the mound of bluish dust.|1
wavs/11_50.wav|From this unseen receiver a little thread of green smoke rose vertically into this quiet air.|1
wavs/11_51.wav|As I looked, the handling machine, with a faint and musical clinking, extended telescopic fashion,|1
wavs/11_52.wav|a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere blunt projection, until its end was hidden behind|1
wavs/11_53.wav|the mound of clay. In another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminum into sight, untarnished|1
wavs/11_54.wav|as yet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited into a growing stack of bars that stood at the side of|1
wavs/11_55.wav|the pit. Between sunset and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a|1
wavs/11_56.wav|hundred such bars out of crude clay, and the mound of bluish dust rose steadily until it topped the|1
wavs/11_57.wav|side of the pit. The contrast between the swift and complex movements of these contrivances|1
wavs/11_58.wav|and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was acute, and for days I had to tell myself|1
wavs/11_59.wav|repeatedly that these latter were indeed the living of the two things. The curate had possession of|1
wavs/11_60.wav|this lid when the first men were brought to the pit. I was sitting below, huddled up, listening|1
wavs/11_61.wav|with all my ears. He made a sudden movement backward, and I, fearful that we were observed,|1
wavs/11_62.wav|crouched in a spasm of terror. He came sliding down the rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness,|1
wavs/11_63.wav|inarticulate, gesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic. His gestures gestured a|1
wavs/11_64.wav|resignation of the slit, and after a little while my curiosity gave me courage, and I rose up,|1
wavs/11_65.wav|stepped across him, and clambered up to it. At first I could see no reason for his frantic|1
wavs/11_66.wav|behavior. The twilight had now come, the stars were little and faint, but the pit was illuminated|1
wavs/11_67.wav|by the flickering green fire that came from the aluminium making. The whole picture was a flickering|1
wavs/11_68.wav|scheme of green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows strangely trying to the eyes.|1
wavs/11_69.wav|Over and through it all went the bats, heeding it not at all. The sprawling Martians were no longer|1
wavs/11_70.wav|to be seen, the mound of blue-green powder had risen to cover them from sight, and a fighting|1
wavs/11_71.wav|machine with its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated stood across the corner of the pit,|1
wavs/11_72.wav|and then amid the clanger of the machinery came a drifting suspicion of human voices|1
wavs/11_73.wav|that I entertained at first only to dismiss. I crouched, watching this fighting machine closely,|1
wavs/11_74.wav|satisfying myself now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a Martian.|1
wavs/11_75.wav|As the green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam of his entanglement and the brightness of|1
wavs/11_76.wav|his eyes, and suddenly I heard a yell. I saw a long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the|1
wavs/11_77.wav|machine to the little cage that hunched upon its back. Then something, something struggling|1
wavs/11_78.wav|violently was lifted high against the sky, a black vague enigma against the starlight,|1
wavs/11_79.wav|and as this black object came down again I saw by the green brightness that it was a man.|1
wavs/11_80.wav|For an instant he was clearly visible. He was a stout, ruddy, middle-aged man, well dressed.|1
wavs/11_81.wav|Three days before he must have been walking the world, a man of considerable consequence,|1
wavs/11_82.wav|I could see his staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch-chain.|1
wavs/11_83.wav|He vanished behind the mound, and for a moment there was silence,|1
wavs/11_84.wav|and then began a shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting from the Martians.|1
wavs/11_85.wav|I slid down the rubbish-struggle to my feet, clapped my hands over my ears, and bolted into|1
wavs/11_86.wav|the scullery. The curate, who had been crouching silently with his arms over his head,|1
wavs/11_87.wav|looked up as I passed, cried out quite loudly at my discerning of him, and came running after me.|1
wavs/11_88.wav|That night as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between our horror and the terrible fascination|1
wavs/11_89.wav|this peeping had, although I felt an urgent need of action, I tried in vain to conceive some plan|1
wavs/11_90.wav|of escape. But afterwards, during the second day, I was able to consider our position with great|1
wavs/11_91.wav|clearness. The curate, I found, was quite incapable of discussion. This new and culminating|1
wavs/11_92.wav|atrocity had robbed him of all vestiges of reason or forethought. Practically he had already sunk|1
wavs/11_93.wav|to the level of an animal. But, as the saying goes, I gripped myself with both hands.|1
wavs/11_94.wav|It grew upon my mind, once I could face the facts, that terrible as our position was,|1
wavs/11_95.wav|there was as yet no justification for absolute despair. No chief chance lay in the possibility|1
wavs/11_96.wav|of the Martians making the pit nothing more than a temporary encampment.|1
wavs/11_97.wav|Or even if they kept it permanently, they might not consider it necessary to guard it,|1
wavs/11_98.wav|and a chance of escape might be afforded to us. I also weighed very carefully the possibility of|1
wavs/11_99.wav|our digging away out in a direction away from the pit. But the chances of our emerging within sight|1
wavs/11_100.wav|of some sentinel fighting machines seemed at first too great, and I should have had to do all|1
wavs/11_101.wav|the digging myself. The curate would certainly have failed me.|1
wavs/11_102.wav|It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right, that I saw the lad killed. It was the only|1
wavs/11_103.wav|occasion on which I actually saw the Martians feed. After that experience I avoided the hold|1
wavs/11_104.wav|in the wall for the better part of the day. I went into the scullery, removed the door,|1
wavs/11_105.wav|and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible. But when I had made a hold|1
wavs/11_106.wav|about a couple of feet deep, the loose earth collapsed noisily, and I did not dare continue.|1
wavs/11_107.wav|I lost heart and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time, having no spirit even to move,|1
wavs/11_108.wav|and after that I abandoned altogether the idea of escaping by excavation.|1
wavs/11_109.wav|It says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me that at first I entertained little|1
wavs/11_110.wav|or no hope of our escape being brought about by their overthrow through any human effort.|1
wavs/11_111.wav|But on the fourth or fifth night I heard a sound like heavy guns. It was very late in the night,|1
wavs/11_112.wav|and the moon was shining brightly. The Martians had taken away the excavation machine,|1
wavs/11_113.wav|and I was left with nothing but a shadow of a shadow.|1
wavs/11_114.wav|And, save for a fighting machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit,|1
wavs/11_115.wav|and a handling machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the pit immediately|1
wavs/11_116.wav|beneath my peephole, the place was deserted by them. Except for the pale glow from the handling|1
wavs/11_117.wav|machine and the bars and patches of white moonlight, the pit was in darkness, and except|1
wavs/11_118.wav|for the clinking of the handling machine, quite still. That night was a beautiful serenity.|1
wavs/11_119.wav|Save for one planet, the moon seemed to have the sky to herself.|1
wavs/11_120.wav|I heard a dog howling, and that familiar sound it was that made me listen.|1
wavs/11_121.wav|Then I heard quite distinctly a booming exactly like the sound of great guns.|1
wavs/11_122.wav|Six distinct reports, I counted, and after a long interval six again, and that was all.|1
wavs/11_123.wav|End of chapter three in book two|1
wavs/11_124.wav|you|1
wavs/12_0.wav|The Epilogue|1
wavs/12_1.wav|I cannot but regret, now that I am concluding my story, how little I am able to contribute|1
wavs/12_2.wav|to the discussion of the many debatable questions which are still unsettled.|1
wavs/12_3.wav|In one respect I shall certainly provoke criticism.|1
wavs/12_4.wav|My particular province is speculative philosophy, my knowledge of competitive physiology is|1
wavs/12_5.wav|confined to a book or two, but it seems to me that Carver's suggestions as to the reason|1
wavs/12_6.wav|of the rapid death of the Martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as proven|1
wavs/12_7.wav|conclusion.|1
wavs/12_8.wav|I have assumed that in the body of my narrative.|1
wavs/12_9.wav|At any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians that were examined after the war, no bacteria|1
wavs/12_10.wav|except those already known as terrestrial species were found.|1
wavs/12_11.wav|That they did not bury any of their dead, and the Rector's slaughter they perpetrated.|1
wavs/12_12.wav|Point also to an entire ignorance of the putrefactive process.|1
wavs/12_13.wav|But probable as this seems, it is by no means a proven conclusion.|1
wavs/12_14.wav|Neither is the composition of the black smoke known, which the Martians used with such deadly|1
wavs/12_15.wav|effect, and the generator of the heat-ray remains a puzzle.|1
wavs/12_16.wav|Terrible disasters at the Ealing and Thou's Kensington Laboratories have disinclined analysts|1
wavs/12_17.wav|for further investigations upon the latter.|1
wavs/12_18.wav|Spectrum analysis of the black powder points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown|1
wavs/12_19.wav|element with a brilliant group of the three lines in the green, and it is possible that|1
wavs/12_20.wav|it combines with argon to form a compound which acts as once with deadly effect upon|1
wavs/12_21.wav|some constituent in the blood.|1
wavs/12_22.wav|But such unproven speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader to whom|1
wavs/12_23.wav|this story is addressed.|1
wavs/12_24.wav|None of the brown scum that drifted down their thames after the destruction of Shepperton|1
wavs/12_25.wav|was examined at that time, and no one is forthcoming.|1
wavs/12_26.wav|The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians so far, as the prowling dogs|1
wavs/12_27.wav|had left such an examination possible, I have already given.|1
wavs/12_28.wav|But everyone is familiar with the magnificent and almost complete specimen in spirits at|1
wavs/12_29.wav|the Natural History Museum, and the countless drawings that have been made from it, and|1
wavs/12_30.wav|beyond that the interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific.|1
wavs/12_31.wav|The question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of another attack from|1
wavs/12_32.wav|the Martians.|1
wavs/12_33.wav|I do not think that nearly enough attention is being given to this aspect of the matter.|1
wavs/12_34.wav|At present the planet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to opposition, I for|1
wavs/12_35.wav|one anticipate a renewal of their adventure.|1
wavs/12_36.wav|In any case, we should be prepared.|1
wavs/12_37.wav|It seems to me that it should be possible to define the position of the gun from which|1
wavs/12_38.wav|the shots are discharged to keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to|1
wavs/12_39.wav|anticipate the arrival of the next attack.|1
wavs/12_40.wav|In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillery before it was sufficiently|1
wavs/12_41.wav|cool for the Martians to emerge, or they might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the|1
wavs/12_42.wav|screw opened.|1
wavs/12_43.wav|It seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure of their first surprise.|1
wavs/12_44.wav|Possibly they see it in the same light.|1
wavs/12_45.wav|Dessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the Martians have actually|1
wavs/12_46.wav|succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet Venus.|1
wavs/12_47.wav|One month ago now Venus and Mars were in alignment with the Sun, that is to say Mars was in a|1
wavs/12_48.wav|position from the point of view of an observer on Venus.|1
wavs/12_49.wav|Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking appeared on the unilluminated half|1
wavs/12_50.wav|of the inner planet, and almost simultaneously a faint dark mug of a similar sinuous character|1
wavs/12_51.wav|was detected upon a photograph of the Martian disk.|1
wavs/12_52.wav|One needs to see the drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their remarkable|1
wavs/12_53.wav|resemblance and character.|1
wavs/12_54.wav|At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views of the human future must|1
wavs/12_55.wav|be greatly modified by these events.|1
wavs/12_56.wav|We have learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a secure|1
wavs/12_57.wav|abiding place for men.|1
wavs/12_58.wav|We can never anticipate the unseen good or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of|1
wavs/12_59.wav|space.|1
wavs/12_60.wav|It may be that in the larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not without|1
wavs/12_61.wav|its ultimate benefit for men.|1
wavs/12_62.wav|It has rubbed us of that serene confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source|1
wavs/12_63.wav|of decadence.|1
wavs/12_64.wav|The gifts to human science it has brought are enormous and it has done much to promote|1
wavs/12_65.wav|the conception of the common weal of mankind.|1
wavs/12_66.wav|It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians have watched the fate of these|1
wavs/12_67.wav|pioneers of theirs and learned their lessons and that on the planet Venus they have found|1
wavs/12_68.wav|a secure settlement.|1
wavs/12_69.wav|Be that as it may, for many years yet there will certainly be no relaxation of the eager|1
wavs/12_70.wav|scrutiny of the Martian disk and those fiery darts of the sky, the shooting stars, will|1
wavs/12_71.wav|bring with them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.|1
wavs/12_72.wav|The broadening of men's views that has resulted can scarcely be exaggerated.|1
wavs/12_73.wav|Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion that through all the deep of space|1
wavs/12_74.wav|no life exists beyond the pity surface of our minute sphere.|1
wavs/12_75.wav|Now we see further.|1
wavs/12_76.wav|If the Martians can reach Venus there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible|1
wavs/12_77.wav|for men.|1
wavs/12_78.wav|And when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth uninhabitable, as at last it must|1
wavs/12_79.wav|do, it may be that the thread of life that has begun here will have streamed out and|1
wavs/12_80.wav|caught our sister planet within its toils.|1
wavs/12_81.wav|Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of life spreading slowly from|1
wavs/12_82.wav|this little seedbed of the solar system throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space.|1
wavs/12_83.wav|But that is a remote dream.|1
wavs/12_84.wav|It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction of the Martians is only a reprive.|1
wavs/12_85.wav|To them and not to us, perhaps, is the future ordained.|1
wavs/12_86.wav|I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding sense of doubt and|1
wavs/12_87.wav|insecurity in my mind.|1
wavs/12_88.wav|I sit in my study, writing by lamplight, and suddenly I see again the healing valley below|1
wavs/12_89.wav|set with visiting flames, and feel the house behind and about me, empty and desolate.|1
wavs/12_90.wav|I go out into the by-fleet road, and vehicles pass me, a butcher boy in a cart, a cab full|1
wavs/12_91.wav|of visitors, a workman on a bicycle, children going to school, and suddenly they become|1
wavs/12_92.wav|vague and unreal, and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot, brooding silence.|1
wavs/12_93.wav|Overnight I see the black powder darkening the silent streets, and the contorted bodies|1
wavs/12_94.wav|shrouded in that layer.|1
wavs/12_95.wav|They rise up upon me, tattered and dark-bidden.|1
wavs/12_96.wav|They gibber and grow fiercer, paler, uglier, mad distortions of humanity at last, and awake,|1
wavs/12_97.wav|cold and wretched in the darkness of the night.|1
wavs/12_98.wav|I go to London and see the busy multitudes and Fleet Street and the Strand, and it comes|1
wavs/12_99.wav|across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the past, haunting the streets that I have|1
wavs/12_100.wav|seen silent and wretched, going to and fro, phantasms in a dead city, the mockery of life|1
wavs/12_101.wav|in a galvanized body.|1
wavs/12_102.wav|And strange, too, it is to stand on Primrose Hill, as I did but a day before writing this|1
wavs/12_103.wav|last chapter, to see the great province of houses, dim and blue, through the haze of|1
wavs/12_104.wav|the smoke and mist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to see the people walking|1
wavs/12_105.wav|to and fro among the flower beds on the hill, to see the sightseers about the Martian machine|1
wavs/12_106.wav|that stands there still, to hear the tumult of playing children, and to recall the time|1
wavs/12_107.wav|when I saw it all bright and clear-cut, hard and silent under the dawn of that last great|1
wavs/12_108.wav|day.|1
wavs/12_109.wav|And strangest of it all is to hold my wife's hand again, and to think that I have counted|1
wavs/12_110.wav|her and that she has counted me among the dead.|1

wavs/13_5.wav|Chapter 2, part 1.|1
wavs/13_6.wav|Clekipetra.|1
wavs/13_7.wav|We are almost at the end of the wonderful North American autumn|1
wavs/13_8.wav|and have been in action for over three months,|1
wavs/13_9.wav|but our task has not been solved yet,|1
wavs/13_10.wav|while the other sections have usually returned home.|1
wavs/13_11.wav|There were two reasons for this.|1
wavs/13_12.wav|The first reason was the fact that we had a very difficult area to work in.|1
wavs/13_13.wav|The railway should follow through the prairies, the course of southern Canada.|1
wavs/13_14.wav|The direction was therefore designated up to the source areas,|1
wavs/13_15.wav|while it was also prescribed by the position of the valleys and passes from New Mexico.|1
wavs/13_16.wav|Our section was located between the Canadian and New Mexico,|1
wavs/13_17.wav|and we had the appropriate direction to discover first.|1
wavs/13_18.wav|In addition, time-consuming rides, exhausting hikes and many comparative measurements were necessary|1
wavs/13_19.wav|before we could get to the actual work.|1
wavs/13_20.wav|All this was further made difficult by the fact that we were in a dangerous area,|1
wavs/13_21.wav|because the Cayoacan, Comanche and Apache Indians were moving around,|1
wavs/13_22.wav|who did not want to know anything about a train through the terrain,|1
wavs/13_23.wav|which they called their property.|1
wavs/13_24.wav|We had to be extremely careful and always be on our guard,|1
wavs/13_25.wav|which made our work of course extraordinarily difficult and slowed down.|1
wavs/13_26.wav|Given these Indians, we had to give up on eating through the benefits of hunting,|1
wavs/13_27.wav|because we would have led the Reds to our tracks.|1
wavs/13_28.wav|We took much more of what we needed by ox cart from Santa Fe.|1
wavs/13_29.wav|Unfortunately, this transport was also very unsafe,|1
wavs/13_30.wav|and we could not move forward with our measurements,|1
wavs/13_31.wav|because we had to wait for the car to arrive.|1
wavs/13_32.wav|The second reason was the composition of our society.|1
wavs/13_33.wav|I mentioned that I was very warmly welcomed in St. Louis by the engineer and the three surveyors.|1
wavs/13_34.wav|This recording, which I found with them,|1
wavs/13_35.wav|left me with a good and successful interaction,|1
wavs/13_36.wav|but I should have been disappointed.|1
wavs/13_37.wav|My colleagues were real Yankees,|1
wavs/13_38.wav|who saw in me the Greenhorn, the inexperienced Dutchman,|1
wavs/13_39.wav|and took this last word as an insult.|1
wavs/13_40.wav|They wanted to earn money without asking much about whether they really fulfilled their task consciously.|1
wavs/13_41.wav|I was a real German hamster,|1
wavs/13_42.wav|whom they soon took away from the first sight.|1
wavs/13_43.wav|I did not let them do this, and did my duty.|1
wavs/13_44.wav|Not much time had passed, so I noticed that it was not very far off with their knowledge.|1
wavs/13_45.wav|They gave me the most difficult jobs and made life as easy as possible.|1
wavs/13_46.wav|I had nothing to complain about,|1
wavs/13_47.wav|because I have always been of the opinion that the more you get stronger, the more you have to do.|1
wavs/13_48.wav|Mr. Bancroft, the senior engineer, was the most educated of them,|1
wavs/13_49.wav|but unfortunately it turned out that he loved brandy.|1
wavs/13_50.wav|Some barrels of this terrible drink were brought from Santa Fe,|1
wavs/13_51.wav|and since then he has been busy with the brandy much more than with the measuring instruments.|1
wavs/13_52.wav|It turned out that he was half a day totally drunk on the ground.|1
wavs/13_53.wav|Riggs, Marcy and Wheeler, the three surveyors, had to pay for the schnapps, just like me,|1
wavs/13_54.wav|and they drank to keep up with him for the bet.|1
wavs/13_55.wav|It is possible to think that these gentlemen often did not find themselves in the best conditions.|1
wavs/13_56.wav|Since I did not drink a drop, I was of course the workman,|1
wavs/13_57.wav|while they kept to the regular intervals between drinking and sleeping out of their drunkenness.|1
wavs/13_58.wav|Wheeler was still my favorite of them,|1
wavs/13_59.wav|because he had so much understanding that I was bothering them without being obliged to do so.|1
wavs/13_60.wav|It is quite obvious that our work suffers under these conditions.|1
wavs/13_61.wav|The rest of society had no less to wish for.|1
wavs/13_62.wav|At our arrival at section 12, we had met with the Westmen waiting for us.|1
wavs/13_63.wav|As a newcomer, I had a very significant respect for them in the first place,|1
wavs/13_64.wav|but soon realized that I had to deal with people of very low moral rank.|1
wavs/13_65.wav|They should protect us and help us with our work.|1
wavs/13_66.wav|Fortunately, nothing came up for three months that would have given me the opportunity|1
wavs/13_67.wav|to enter into this very dubious protection.|1
wavs/13_68.wav|And as for their help, I could say with full right|1
wavs/13_69.wav|that the twelve greatest lazy people of the United States had given themselves in here.|1
wavs/13_70.wav|How sad must it be to be given discipline under such circumstances?|1
wavs/13_71.wav|Bantroft was the name and the order of the commander,|1
wavs/13_72.wav|and he was quite determined to be so.|1
wavs/13_73.wav|But no one obeyed him.|1
wavs/13_74.wav|When he gave an order, they laughed at him.|1
wavs/13_75.wav|Then he cursed, as I rarely hear a man curse,|1
wavs/13_76.wav|and went to the brink of burning to reward himself for this effort.|1
wavs/13_77.wav|Riggs, Marcy and Wheeler did not act much differently.|1
wavs/13_78.wav|I would have had every reason to empower myself and I did,|1
wavs/13_79.wav|but so that one did not notice it.|1
wavs/13_80.wav|Such a young, inexperienced man could be seen by such people as impossible for full.|1
wavs/13_81.wav|If I had been so stupid as to speak in a vulgar tone,|1
wavs/13_82.wav|the success would certainly have been in a silent laughter.|1
wavs/13_83.wav|No, I had to drive quietly and carefully,|1
wavs/13_84.wav|like a clever woman who knows how to steer and guide her hairy husband|1
wavs/13_85.wav|without him having any idea.|1
wavs/13_86.wav|I was called a greenhorn ten times by these half-wild, hard-to-cure Western men every day,|1
wavs/13_87.wav|and yet they directed themselves unconsciously towards me,|1
wavs/13_88.wav|in which I read them to the opinion that they were following their own will.|1
wavs/13_89.wav|Here I had a preferential support,|1
wavs/13_90.wav|Sam Hawkins and his two companions Dick Stone and Will Parker.|1
wavs/13_91.wav|These three men were honest all the way through,|1
wavs/13_92.wav|and what I could not have seen in St. Louis with the little Sam at our first meeting,|1
wavs/13_93.wav|experienced clever and cunning Westerners whose names had a good sound.|1
wavs/13_94.wav|They mostly held to me and withdrew from the others,|1
wavs/13_95.wav|but so that they could not feel offended.|1
wavs/13_96.wav|Sam Hawkins especially understood, despite his strange peculiarities,|1
wavs/13_97.wav|what he wanted to achieve in the rebellious society,|1
wavs/13_98.wav|and as often as he put something through in his half-wild and half-cunning tone,|1
wavs/13_99.wav|this always happened, to help me remember what I wanted.|1
wavs/13_100.wav|There had been a relationship between him and me in silence,|1
wavs/13_101.wav|which I would best call serenity, the sublime glory of the upper class.|1
wavs/13_102.wav|He took me under his protection,|1
wavs/13_103.wav|like a person you do not even need to ask if he agrees with it.|1
wavs/13_104.wav|I was the greenhorn and he was the experienced Western,|1
wavs/13_105.wav|whose words and deeds had to be flawless for me.|1
wavs/13_106.wav|He often gave me time and opportunity to teach theoretical and practical lessons|1
wavs/13_107.wav|in everything that you have to know and be able to do in the Wild West.|1
wavs/13_108.wav|And if I have to tell the truth today that later I went through high school at Veneto's side,|1
wavs/13_109.wav|I have to admit cheaply that Sam Hawkins was my elementary teacher.|1
wavs/13_110.wav|He even made me a lasso by himself|1
wavs/13_111.wav|and allowed me to practice his own little person and his horse in the throwing of this dangerous weapon.|1
wavs/13_112.wav|When I had gotten so far that the string was unfailingly attached to each throw,|1
wavs/13_113.wav|he was happy and called out,|1
wavs/13_114.wav|''Beautiful, my young sir, you are right, but do not be fooled by this praise.|1
wavs/13_115.wav|A schoolmaster must praise even the stupidest boy if he should not sit still.|1
wavs/13_116.wav|I have been the teacher of some young Western men,|1
wavs/13_117.wav|and they all learned much easier and understood me much faster than you.|1
wavs/13_118.wav|But if you keep practicing like this, it may be possible that after six or eight years|1
wavs/13_119.wav|you will no longer need to be called a greenhorn.|1
wavs/13_120.wav|Until then, you may comfort yourselves with the old experience that a fool is just as far|1
wavs/13_121.wav|or even further than a fool, if you do not mislead me.''|1
wavs/13_122.wav|He apparently presented this in the greatest seriousness|1
wavs/13_123.wav|and I took it seriously with the same seriousness,|1
wavs/13_124.wav|but knew quite well how completely different he meant it.|1
wavs/13_125.wav|I was particularly welcomed by these instructions,|1
wavs/13_126.wav|because the work took me so seriously that if I had not been Sam Hawkins,|1
wavs/13_127.wav|I probably would not have taken the time to practice in the skills that a prairie hunter must possess.|1
wavs/13_128.wav|By the way, we kept this exercise secret.|1
wavs/13_129.wav|They were always taken into such a distance from the camp that we could not be observed.|1
wavs/13_130.wav|Sam wanted it that way, and when I asked him about the reason, he replied,|1
wavs/13_131.wav|''Do you love each other, sir?|1
wavs/13_132.wav|You are so not good at such things that I would have to be ashamed of in your soul|1
wavs/13_133.wav|when these guys see us.|1
wavs/13_134.wav|So now you know.|1
wavs/13_135.wav|Take it to heart.''|1
wavs/13_136.wav|The result was that the whole society|1
wavs/13_137.wav|did not trust me in relation to gun control and physical skills,|1
wavs/13_138.wav|which could not hurt me at all.|1
wavs/13_139.wav|Despite all the obstacles mentioned above, we finally got so far|1
wavs/13_140.wav|that we could reach the connection to the next section after perhaps a week.|1
wavs/13_141.wav|To report this there, a boat had to be sent.|1
wavs/13_142.wav|Bancroft explained that he would take this ride himself and one of the Westmen as a guide.|1
wavs/13_143.wav|This sending of a message was not the first one,|1
wavs/13_144.wav|because we had to stand in a boat traffic in both the rear and the section in front of us.|1
wavs/13_145.wav|As a result, I knew that the engineer in front of us was a very capable man.|1
wavs/13_146.wav|It was a Sunday morning when Bancroft wanted to set sail.|1
wavs/13_147.wav|He was required to make a farewell drink beforehand, which everyone should take part in.|1
wavs/13_148.wav|I was not invited alone.|1
wavs/13_149.wav|And Hawkins, Stone and Parker did not follow the request they had made.|1
wavs/13_150.wav|The drink, as I had guessed, was so long that he only stopped when Bancroft could hardly moan.|1
wavs/13_151.wav|His fellow techs had kept up with him and were no less drunk than he was.|1
wavs/13_152.wav|There was no talk of the intentional ride for now.|1
wavs/13_153.wav|The oddities that had always happened in this state.|1
wavs/13_154.wav|They crawled behind the bushes to sleep.|1
wavs/13_155.wav|What to do now?|1
wavs/13_156.wav|The boat had to leave and these people slept in by the afternoon.|1
wavs/13_157.wav|It was best if I took the ride.|1
wavs/13_158.wav|But could I leave?|1
wavs/13_159.wav|I was convinced that there would be no talk of work until my return after a period of four days.|1
wavs/13_160.wav|But while I was talking to Sam Hawkins about it, he was pointing with his hand to the west and said,|1
wavs/13_161.wav|It will not be necessary that you ride, sir.|1
wavs/13_162.wav|You can give the message to the two who come there.|1
wavs/13_163.wav|As I looked in the direction indicated, I saw two riders approaching us.|1
wavs/13_164.wav|They were white and in one I recognized an old scout who had been with us several times to inform us of the next section.|1
wavs/13_165.wav|Next to him was a younger man riding, who was not dressed like a westerner.|1
wavs/13_166.wav|I had not seen him yet.|1
wavs/13_167.wav|I went to them.|1
wavs/13_168.wav|When I reached them, they held their horses and the stranger asked me for my name.|1
wavs/13_169.wav|When I had called him the same, he looked at me with a friendly, research look and said,|1
wavs/13_170.wav|So you are the young German gentleman who does all the work here, while the others are on the lazy side.|1
wavs/13_171.wav|You will know who I am when I tell you my name, sir.|1
wavs/13_172.wav|My name is White.|1
wavs/13_173.wav|That was the name of the conductor of the next section west of here, to which the boat was to be sent.|1
wavs/13_174.wav|There must be a reason why he came himself.|1
wavs/13_175.wav|He got off the horse, gave me his hand and let his eye look over our camp,|1
wavs/13_176.wav|when he saw the sleepers behind the bushes and then the brandwine barrel,|1
wavs/13_177.wav|there was a understanding, but not a friendly smile over his face.|1
wavs/13_178.wav|Are you drunk?|1
wavs/13_179.wav|He asked.|1
wavs/13_180.wav|I nodded.|1
wavs/13_181.wav|All of them?|1
wavs/13_182.wav|Yes, Mr. Bancroft wanted to see you and there was a small farewell drink.|1
wavs/13_183.wav|I will wake him up and ...|1
wavs/13_184.wav|Stop, he fell into my speech.|1
wavs/13_185.wav|Let them sleep.|1
wavs/13_186.wav|I love that I can talk to you without them hearing it.|1
wavs/13_187.wav|Let's go to the side and don't wake them up.|1
wavs/13_188.wav|Who are the three men standing there with you?|1
wavs/13_189.wav|Sam Hawkins, Will Parker and Dick Stone, our three most reliable scouts.|1
wavs/13_190.wav|Ah, Hawkins, the little special hunter.|1
wavs/13_191.wav|Good guy, I heard from him.|1
wavs/13_192.wav|The three may come with us.|1
wavs/13_193.wav|I followed this request by waving them to us and then asked myself.|1
wavs/13_194.wav|You come yourself, Mr. White?|1
wavs/13_195.wav|Is there anything important you bring us?|1
wavs/13_196.wav|Nothing more than that I see you here once after the right and want to talk to you,|1
wavs/13_197.wav|Mr. Wright, with you.|1
wavs/13_198.wav|We are done with our section, you with the Eurig not yet.|1
wavs/13_199.wav|The difficulties of the terrain are to blame for this and I want ...|1
wavs/13_200.wav|White, White, he interrupted me.|1
wavs/13_201.wav|White, unfortunately, knows everything.|1
wavs/13_202.wav|If you hadn't been three times as hard on yourself,|1
wavs/13_203.wav|Bancroft would still be where he started.|1
wavs/13_204.wav|That is not the case, Mr. White.|1
wavs/13_205.wav|I don't know how you came to the ridiculous view|1
wavs/13_206.wav|that I should have been alone,|1
wavs/13_207.wav|but it is my duty ...|1
wavs/13_208.wav|Still, sir, still.|1
wavs/13_209.wav|There are boats that went back and forth between you and us.|1
wavs/13_210.wav|I've been avoiding them without them noticing.|1
wavs/13_211.wav|It is very noble of you to want to protect these drunks here.|1
wavs/13_212.wav|But I want to hear the truth.|1
wavs/13_213.wav|And since I see and hear that you are too noble to tell me,|1
wavs/13_214.wav|I will not ask you, but Sam Hawkins.|1
wavs/13_215.wav|Let's settle down here.|1
wavs/13_216.wav|We went to our tent.|1
wavs/13_217.wav|He sat in the grass in front of it and waved to us to do the same.|1
wavs/13_218.wav|When we had received this request,|1
wavs/13_219.wav|he began to interrogate Sam Hawkins, Stone and Parker.|1
wavs/13_220.wav|They told him everything without adding a superfluous word to the truth.|1
wavs/13_221.wav|Nevertheless, I made a remark here and there|1
wavs/13_222.wav|to mitigate certain hardships and defend my colleagues.|1
wavs/13_223.wav|But this did not satisfy the intended impression of White.|1
wavs/13_224.wav|On the contrary, he asked me to repeat this effort of mine,|1
wavs/13_225.wav|because they are completely unsuccessful.|1
wavs/13_226.wav|Then, when he knew everything, he asked me to show him our drawing and the diary.|1
wavs/13_227.wav|I did not need to fulfill this wish of his,|1
wavs/13_228.wav|but I did it anyway, because otherwise I would have insulted him.|1
wavs/13_229.wav|And I saw that he meant it well with me.|1
wavs/13_230.wav|He saw everything very carefully, and when he asked me afterwards,|1
wavs/13_231.wav|I could not deny that I was the only draftsman and writer,|1
wavs/13_232.wav|because none of the others had done a stroke or written a letter.|1
wavs/13_233.wav|But from this diary you can't see how much or how little work comes to the individual, he said.|1
wavs/13_234.wav|You have gone far too far in your frivolous collegiality.|1
wavs/13_235.wav|Hawkins noticed with a puffy face.|1
wavs/13_236.wav|Grab him in the chest pocket, Mr. White, there is a sheet of a thing|1
wavs/13_237.wav|where oil sardines have been.|1
wavs/13_238.wav|The sardines are out, but there is something paper in it.|1
wavs/13_239.wav|That must be his private diary, if I'm not mistaken.|1
wavs/13_240.wav|In this it will sound completely different than here in the official report,|1
wavs/13_241.wav|in which he defiled the laziness of his colleagues.|1
wavs/13_242.wav|Sam knew that I had made private records|1
wavs/13_243.wav|and he carried them in the empty sardine box with me.|1
wavs/13_244.wav|It was unpleasant for me that he said that.|1
wavs/13_245.wav|White asked me to show him that too.|1
wavs/13_246.wav|What should I do?|1
wavs/13_247.wav|Did my colleagues deserve that I was torturing myself for them without being grateful?|1
wavs/13_248.wav|And that I would then also keep quiet about it?|1
wavs/13_249.wav|I didn't want to hurt them, but I didn't want to be rude to White either.|1
wavs/13_250.wav|I gave him my diary, but under the condition that he doesn't talk about the content.|1
wavs/13_251.wav|He read it through, gave it back to me and said,|1
wavs/13_252.wav|Actually, I should take the sheets with me and hand them over to the concerned party.|1
wavs/13_253.wav|Your colleagues are completely incompetent people who should not be paid a single dollar more.|1
wavs/13_254.wav|You would have to pay three times.|1
wavs/13_255.wav|But as you wish, I just want to draw your attention to the fact that it will be good for you|1
wavs/13_256.wav|to pick up these private notes.|1
wavs/13_257.wav|They may be of great use to you later.|1
wavs/13_258.wav|Now we want to wake up the famous gentlemen.|1
wavs/13_259.wav|He stood up and made noise.|1
wavs/13_260.wav|The gentlemen came out with their eyes and their faces distorted behind their bushes.|1
wavs/13_261.wav|Bancroft wanted to be rude about being disturbed in his sleep.|1
wavs/13_262.wav|But he was polite when I told him that Mr. White had arrived from the next section.|1
wavs/13_263.wav|The two had not seen each other yet.|1
wavs/13_264.wav|The first thing he did was offer him a cup of brandy, but that made him an unjust man.|1
wavs/13_265.wav|White immediately used this offer as a link to a criminal complaint,|1
wavs/13_266.wav|which Bancroft had certainly not heard or even received himself.|1
wavs/13_267.wav|He listened to her for a while, astonished, speechless.|1
wavs/13_268.wav|Then he drove off to the speaker, held him in his arms and shouted at him,|1
wavs/13_269.wav|Sir, do you want to tell me what his name is?|1
wavs/13_270.wav|White, I know. You heard that.|1
wavs/13_271.wav|And what are you?|1
wavs/13_272.wav|Senior engineer of the neighboring section.|1
wavs/13_273.wav|Does any of us have anything to order you there?|1
wavs/13_274.wav|I think no.|1
wavs/13_275.wav|Well, my name is Bancroft and I am the senior engineer of the former section.|1
wavs/13_276.wav|No one has anything to order me, at least you, Mr. White.|1
wavs/13_277.wav|It is right that we stand completely equal, he replied calmly.|1
wavs/13_278.wav|No one of us needs to take orders from the other.|1
wavs/13_279.wav|But if one sees that the other is damaging the company in which both should work,|1
wavs/13_280.wav|it is his duty to make his mistakes and his mistakes aware.|1
wavs/13_281.wav|Your life task seems to be putting in brandy.|1
wavs/13_282.wav|I count 16 people here who were all drunk when I arrived here two hours ago and so on.|1
wavs/13_283.wav|Two hours ago?|1
wavs/13_284.wav|Bancroft said.|1
wavs/13_285.wav|You've been here that long?|1
wavs/13_286.wav|However, I looked at the recordings and learned about who made them.|1
wavs/13_287.wav|This was the pure slum here, while one and only and the youngest of you all had to handle all the work.|1
wavs/13_288.wav|Then Bancroft walked up to me and said,|1
wavs/13_289.wav|You said that? You and no one else?|1
wavs/13_290.wav|Does your lowly liar, your anti-Turkish traitor deny it?|1
wavs/13_291.wav|No, said Dingwight.|1
wavs/13_292.wav|Your young colleague acted like a gentleman and only spoke good things about you.|1
wavs/13_293.wav|He took you in his protection.|1
wavs/13_294.wav|And I advise you to ask him for forgiveness for calling him a liar and a traitor.|1
wavs/13_295.wav|I don't care to ask for forgiveness, laughed Bancroft in a high tone.|1
wavs/13_296.wav|This greenhorn knows no triangle from a square and still acts like a survivor.|1
wavs/13_297.wav|We didn't come forward because he did everything wrong and stopped us.|1
wavs/13_298.wav|And if he now, instead of seeing this and admitting it, slanders and slanders us at your place...|1
wavs/13_299.wav|He didn't get any further.|1
wavs/13_300.wav|I was patient for months and had these people think about me after their request.|1
wavs/13_301.wav|Now was the time to show them that they had been wrong about me.|1
wavs/13_302.wav|I grabbed Bancroft by the arms, pressed him so that he would not speak out the beginning sentence in pain and said,|1
wavs/13_303.wav|Mr. Bancroft, you drank too much schnapps and didn't sleep.|1
wavs/13_304.wav|I assume that you are still drunk and it may be as if you didn't say anything.|1
wavs/13_305.wav|I? Drunk? You are crazy? He answered.|1
wavs/13_306.wav|Yes, drunk. Because if I knew that you are sober and spoke out the insult with consideration,|1
wavs/13_307.wav|I would have had to beat you to the ground like a boob.|1
wavs/13_308.wav|Understood? Do you still have the heart to deny your drunkenness?|1
wavs/13_309.wav|I still held his arm in my hand. He certainly never believed that he would ever have to be afraid of me.|1
wavs/13_310.wav|Now he is afraid, I tell him.|1
wavs/13_311.wav|He was by no means a weak man, but the expression on my face seemed to scare him.|1
wavs/13_312.wav|He didn't want to say that he was still drunk, but he didn't dare to hold his accusation.|1
wavs/13_313.wav|That's why he turned to the help of the leaders of the Twelve Westmen who had supported us.|1
wavs/13_314.wav|Mr. Rattler, do you dare that this man attacks me? Aren't you here to protect us?|1
wavs/13_315.wav|This Rattler was a tall and broad-built man who seemed to possess the power of three or four people.|1
wavs/13_316.wav|A tall man and at the same time Bancroft's dearest drinker.|1
wavs/13_317.wav|He couldn't stand me and now took the opportunity with pleasure to blow the whistle he had against me.|1
wavs/13_318.wav|He quickly joined in, held me by the arm, as I had Bancroft with the other man, and answered.|1
wavs/13_319.wav|No, I can't tolerate that, Mr. Bancroft.|1
wavs/13_320.wav|This child has not yet run away from his first stumps and wants to threaten grown-up men,|1
wavs/13_321.wav|they understand and deny.|1
wavs/13_322.wav|Get the hand of Mr. Bancroft away, boy, or I'll show you what a greenhorn you are.|1
wavs/13_323.wav|This demand was directed at me.|1
wavs/13_324.wav|He shook my arm at the same time.|1
wavs/13_325.wav|I had to do that because he was a stronger opponent than the engineer.|1
wavs/13_326.wav|If I taught him Moris, it had to work better than if I showed him that I'm not a coward.|1
wavs/13_327.wav|I ripped my arm out of his hand and answered.|1
wavs/13_328.wav|Me, a boy, a greenhorn.|1
wavs/13_329.wav|Say that again, Mr. Rattler, or I'll smash you to the ground.|1
wavs/13_330.wav|You, me, he laughed.|1
wavs/13_331.wav|Such a greenhorn is really so barbaric to believe that ...|1
wavs/13_332.wav|He couldn't continue, because I hit him in the face with the fist,|1
wavs/13_333.wav|that he collapsed stiff like a sack and lay there, stunned.|1
wavs/13_334.wav|For a few short moments there was a deep silence.|1
wavs/13_335.wav|Then one of Rattler's comrades called.|1
wavs/13_336.wav|Oh, devils, shall we watch quietly how such a runaway Dutchman beats our leader?|1
wavs/13_337.wav|On to the harlequin!|1
wavs/13_338.wav|He jumped on me.|1
wavs/13_339.wav|I received him with a kick in the belly.|1
wavs/13_340.wav|This is a safe way to bring the opponent to the trap,|1
wavs/13_341.wav|but you have to stand very firmly on the other leg.|1
wavs/13_342.wav|The guy fell down.|1
wavs/13_343.wav|At the same moment I knelt on his body and gave him the seductive fist to the sleep.|1
wavs/13_344.wav|Then I jumped up quickly, ripped the two revolvers out of the belt and called.|1
wavs/13_345.wav|Who else? The Marcom!|1
wavs/13_346.wav|Rattler's whole gang probably didn't feel like counting the defeat of their two comrades.|1
wavs/13_347.wav|One looked at the other with questions.|1
wavs/13_348.wav|But I warned.|1
wavs/13_349.wav|Do you hear a word, you people?|1
wavs/13_350.wav|Whoever takes a step after me or grabs the weapon with his hand|1
wavs/13_351.wav|gets a bullet in the head at a glance.|1
wavs/13_352.wav|Think, my friends, of the greenhorns in general, what and how you want.|1
wavs/13_353.wav|But I want to prove to you from the German greenhorns|1
wavs/13_354.wav|that only one takes on twelve such Westerners as you are.|1
wavs/13_355.wav|Then Sam Hawkins stood by my side and said,|1
wavs/13_356.wav|And I, Sam Hawkins, would warn you too, if I'm not mistaken.|1
wavs/13_357.wav|This young German greenhorn stands under my very special protection.|1
wavs/13_358.wav|Whoever dares to crumple his hair, I'll shoot a hole in his face right away.|1
wavs/13_359.wav|Am I being serious? You might notice.|1
wavs/13_360.wav|Dick Stone and Will Parker also insisted that they plant next to me,|1
wavs/13_361.wav|to indicate that they were in full agreement with Sam Hawkins.|1
wavs/13_362.wav|That impressed the opponents.|1
wavs/13_363.wav|They turned away from me, moaned, suppressed their curses and threats to the beard,|1
wavs/13_364.wav|and then occasionally engaged with the two fallen to bring them back to consciousness.|1
wavs/13_365.wav|Bancroft thought it was the smartest thing to go after the tent and disappear in it.|1
wavs/13_366.wav|White had looked at me with big, bewildered eyes.|1
wavs/13_367.wav|Now he shook his head and said in a tone of unarticulated astonishment,|1
wavs/13_368.wav|But sir, that's terrible.|1
wavs/13_369.wav|I don't want to get into your fingers.|1
wavs/13_370.wav|You should be called Shatterhand,|1
wavs/13_371.wav|because you crush a tree-long and tree-strong man with a single fist.|1
wavs/13_372.wav|I've never seen anything like it.|1
wavs/13_373.wav|This suggestion seemed to be to Hawkins.|1
wavs/13_374.wav|He was happy.|1
wavs/13_375.wav|Shatterhand!|1
wavs/13_376.wav|A greenhorn and a war name.|1
wavs/13_377.wav|And now even such a name.|1
wavs/13_378.wav|Yes, if Sam Hawkins throws his eyes at a greenhorn, something comes out of it,|1
wavs/13_379.wav|if I'm not mistaken.|1
wavs/13_380.wav|Shatterhand, old Shatterhand,|1
wavs/13_381.wav|quite similar to old Firehand,|1
wavs/13_382.wav|who is also a Westman, strong as a bear.|1
wavs/13_383.wav|What do you say to that, Dick, Will, seven names?|1
wavs/13_384.wav|I couldn't hear what they answered,|1
wavs/13_385.wav|because I was paying attention to White,|1
wavs/13_386.wav|who grabbed my hand and said,|1
wavs/13_387.wav|I like you very much, sir.|1
wavs/13_388.wav|Would you like to go with me?|1
wavs/13_389.wav|Would you like to or not, Mr. White?|1
wavs/13_390.wav|I'm not allowed to.|1
wavs/13_391.wav|Why?|1
wavs/13_392.wav|Because it's my duty to be here.|1
wavs/13_393.wav|Well, I'm responsible for it.|1
wavs/13_394.wav|It's no use to me if I can't answer it myself.|1
wavs/13_395.wav|I was sent here to help this section for the fair,|1
wavs/13_396.wav|and I'm not allowed to leave, because we're not done yet.|1
wavs/13_397.wav|Bancroft will finish it with the other three.|1
wavs/13_398.wav|Yes, but when and how?|1
wavs/13_399.wav|No, I have to stay.|1
wavs/13_400.wav|But keep in mind that this is dangerous for you.|1
wavs/13_401.wav|Why?|1
wavs/13_402.wav|You're still asking that?|1
wavs/13_403.wav|You have to see that you have made these people's spider enemies.|1
wavs/13_404.wav|I didn't.|1
wavs/13_405.wav|I didn't do anything to them.|1
wavs/13_406.wav|That's true.|1
wavs/13_407.wav|Or rather, it was true before.|1
wavs/13_408.wav|Now that you've knocked down two of them, it's over between you and them.|1
wavs/13_409.wav|Yes, maybe.|1
wavs/13_410.wav|I'm not afraid of them.|1
wavs/13_411.wav|And especially these two fist thieves have put me in respect.|1
wavs/13_412.wav|Nobody will dare to get close to me.|1
wavs/13_413.wav|By the way, Hawkins, Stone and Parker are on my side.|1
wavs/13_414.wav|As you wish.|1
wavs/13_415.wav|The will of man is his heaven, but often his hell, too.|1
wavs/13_416.wav|I could have used you.|1
wavs/13_417.wav|But at least you'll accompany me back a bit, won't you?|1
wavs/13_418.wav|When?|1
wavs/13_419.wav|Now.|1
wavs/13_420.wav|You want to break up right away, Mr. White?|1
wavs/13_421.wav|Yes, I found the conditions here in such a way that it can't solve me for longer than is necessary to stay here.|1
wavs/13_422.wav|But you have to eat something anyway, sir.|1
wavs/13_423.wav|It's not necessary.|1
wavs/13_424.wav|We have what we need in our satteltaschen.|1
wavs/13_425.wav|Don't you want to say goodbye to Bancroft?|1
wavs/13_426.wav|I don't feel like it.|1
wavs/13_427.wav|But you came to discuss business with him, didn't you?|1
wavs/13_428.wav|However...|1
wavs/13_429.wav|But I can tell you that, too.|1
wavs/13_430.wav|You even have a better understanding than he does.|1
wavs/13_431.wav|I wanted to warn him of the Reds, above all.|1
wavs/13_432.wav|Have you seen any?|1
wavs/13_433.wav|Not directly, but only their horses.|1
wavs/13_434.wav|It is now the time when the wild mustangs and buffaloes are moving south.|1
wavs/13_435.wav|The Reds are leaving their villages to hunt and make meat.|1
wavs/13_436.wav|The Kiovas are not to be feared, because we have agreed with them because of the barn.|1
wavs/13_437.wav|The Comans and Apaches don't know anything about it yet.|1
wavs/13_438.wav|And so we must not be seen by them.|1
wavs/13_439.wav|As far as I'm concerned, I'm done with my section and leave this area.|1
wavs/13_440.wav|I'm afraid you're going to end up here, too.|1
wavs/13_441.wav|The hay is being offered to you from day to day.|1
wavs/13_442.wav|Now saddle your horse and ask Sam Hawkins if he wants to come along.|1
wavs/13_443.wav|Of course Sam wanted to.|1
wavs/13_444.wav|Actually, I wanted to work today, but it was Sunday, the day of the Lord, on which every|1
wavs/13_445.wav|Christian, even if he is in the wilderness, is supposed to gather and deal with his Christian|1
wavs/13_446.wav|obligations.|1
wavs/13_447.wav|I guess I had earned a day of rest for that.|1
wavs/13_448.wav|So I went to Bancroft in the tent and told him that I would not work today, but would|1
wavs/13_449.wav|accompany White with Sam Hawkins for a while.|1
wavs/13_450.wav|Go to hell and let him break your necks, he answered.|1
wavs/13_451.wav|And I didn't think that this restful wish would come true in a short time.|1
wavs/13_452.wav|I hadn't been in the saddle for a few days and my red saddle was happy to stop when I|1
wavs/13_453.wav|put the stuff on it.|1
wavs/13_454.wav|He had proven himself to be a great horse and I was already looking forward to being able|1
wavs/13_455.wav|to say this to my old gunsmith Henry.|1
wavs/13_456.wav|We rode in the beautiful autumn morning, talked about the planned great railway company|1
wavs/13_457.wav|and about everything that was on our minds.|1
wavs/13_458.wav|White gave me the necessary angles, which related to the connection to his section, and at|1
wavs/13_459.wav|noon we stopped at a water to enjoy a frugal meal.|1
wavs/13_460.wav|Then White rode on with his scout and we stayed for a while to talk about religious|1
wavs/13_461.wav|things.|1
wavs/13_462.wav|Hawkins was a frugal man, even if he didn't let this go too far against others.|1
wavs/13_463.wav|Shortly before we broke up to return, I bent down to the water to shake and drink with|1
wavs/13_464.wav|my hand.|1
wavs/13_465.wav|Then I saw an impression on the ground through the crystal clear liquid, which seemed to|1
wavs/13_466.wav|come from a foot.|1
wavs/13_467.wav|Of course I made Sam aware of it.|1
wavs/13_468.wav|He looked at the impression carefully and said,|1
wavs/13_469.wav|This Mr. White was right when he warned us about the Indians.|1
wavs/13_470.wav|Do you think Sam that this trace comes from an Indian?|1
wavs/13_471.wav|Yes, from an Indian moccasin.|1
wavs/13_472.wav|You are being too bold, huh?|1
wavs/13_473.wav|Not at all.|1
wavs/13_474.wav|You must think or feel something.|1
wavs/13_475.wav|What else should I think than that a red one has been here?|1
wavs/13_476.wav|So don't be afraid.|1
wavs/13_477.wav|I don't notice.|1
wavs/13_478.wav|At least worry.|1
wavs/13_479.wav|Not either.|1
wavs/13_480.wav|Yes, you don't know the red ones.|1
wavs/13_481.wav|I hope to get to know them.|1
wavs/13_482.wav|They will probably be just like other people, namely the enemies of their enemies and the|1
wavs/13_483.wav|friends of their friends.|1
wavs/13_484.wav|And since it is no longer my intention to treat them as enemies, I assume that I have|1
wavs/13_485.wav|nothing to fear from them.|1
wavs/13_486.wav|You are just a greenhorn and will stay forever.|1
wavs/13_487.wav|Imagine how you want to treat the red ones, it will be quite different.|1
wavs/13_488.wav|When might this Indian man have been here?|1
wavs/13_489.wav|About two days ago.|1
wavs/13_490.wav|We will see his trace here in the grass if he had not re-arranged during the time.|1
wavs/13_491.wav|A customer, though.|1
wavs/13_492.wav|A customer, on buffalo meat, yes?|1
wavs/13_493.wav|Because now peace reigns between the former tribes, it cannot have been a war customer.|1
wavs/13_494.wav|The guy was really careless outside.|1
wavs/13_495.wav|So probably very young.|1
wavs/13_496.wav|Why?|1
wavs/13_497.wav|An experienced warrior does not step into the water like this one, where the trace on the|1
wavs/13_498.wav|soft ground remains and can be seen for a long time.|1
wavs/13_499.wav|Such stupidity can only be caused by a dumbhead who is just as a red greenhorn as you are|1
wavs/13_500.wav|a white one.|1
wavs/13_501.wav|And white greenhorns fly even more stupidly than red.|1
wavs/13_502.wav|You can remember that, sir.|1
wavs/13_503.wav|He quietly crawled inside and then stood up to get on his horse.|1
wavs/13_504.wav|The good Sam loved it to give me his warm affection by understanding that he declared me|1
wavs/13_505.wav|stupid.|1
wavs/13_506.wav|End of chapter 2, part 1|1
wavs/13_507.wav|Thanks for watching!|1
